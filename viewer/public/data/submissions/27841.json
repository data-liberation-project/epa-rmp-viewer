As part of the raw water filter plant for the mill's incoming water treatment, chlorine, a regulated substance, is stored in sufficient quantities to be subject to the RMP rule.  This is a Program Level 3 process and there is the potential to have 54,000 pounds of chlorine on site at one time.  Chlorine dioxide is used in the whitening of pulp in the pulp mill and is stored in sufficient quantities to be subject to the RMP rule.  This is a Program Level 3 process and there is the potential to have 25,500 pounds of chlorine dioxide on site at one time.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMeadWestvaco performed an analysis of the potential offsite consequence that an accidental release of chlorine or chlorine dioxide could have on the public or the environment.  The RMP regulations require the analysis of both worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.  MeadWestvaco does not expect a worst-case release ever to occur based on the fact that no similar incident has occurred at the Wickliffe mill since start-up in 1970.  However, the analysis was done as required by the RMP rule and included in this report.  The alternative release scenarios evaluated are intended to represent releases, which might occur based on the mill\u00bfs experience and knowledge of the processes.  The alternative release scenarios are more appropriate in working with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to evaluate the emergency response plan.  While MeadWestvaco believes that these releases are unlikely at the Wickliffe mill, we have evaluated the offsite impacts of these accidental releases as required by the rule.\n\nThe RMP rule specifies that for a Program 3 level process that both a worst case and alternative release scenarios be evaluated.  MeadWestvaco has conducted offsite consequence analysis for both release scenarios using readily available modeling and estimation techniques.  The A"

One of the requirements of the rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the program at the mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirement of the rule and provide an accurate description of the program at the MeadWestvaco Wickliffe mill.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMeadWestvaco is committed to the safety of its workers, contractors and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The mill has systems in place that provide reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include initial and ongoing training for operators, and several programs to help ensure safety and health.  Environmental policies are met during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of process equipment.  Additionally, several programs and audit systems exist that continually evaluate hazards at the mill.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, MeadWestvaco personnel will control and contain the release in a manner that will reduce the risk of exposure to workers, the public, and the environment.  MeadWestvaco has more than one hundred emergency responders trained in dealing with releases of materials specific to the mill.  Procedures in place outline the responsibilities of the incident commander to oversee response and coordinate activities with local emergency response personnel.  Materials on site and response activities have been reviewed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the State Disaster and Emergency Response Coordinator. \n\n\nMeadWestvaco and Regulated Substances\n\nThe MeadWestvaco Wickliffe, Kentucky mil"

      "SummaryText": "LOHA air dispersion model was used along with the RMP Comp estimation technique for this analysis.  Both techniques have been approved for use in evaluating offsite consequences under the RMP.  The purpose of performing the modeling is to determine the distance to which certain effects may be experienced by public or environmental receptors.  This distance is called an endpoint distance.  When evaluating an accidental release, most people at or beyond the endpoint would be able to walk away from the exposure with no long-term health effects.  However, some short-term effects may be felt.\n\nThe worst case release scenario must be analyzed for the one regulated toxic substance estimated to create the greatest distance to the applicable endpoint concentration from the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel containing the regulated substance (subject to administrative and engineering controls).  This worst case release scenario consists of the catastrophic failure of the chlorine dioxide storage tank and the spill of the maximum contents of this tank (95% of 221,900 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution).  Several overly conservative assumptions are included in this worst-case release scenario.  These assumptions include the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the tank, the accident occurs on the hottest day, there will be very light wind and no response by automatic systems or personnel can be factored into the modeling.  This release scenario will affect areas outside the mill site.  There are both public and environmental receptors within this area.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of the release of 10 pounds (3.15 kg) of chlorine over a ten minute period from the failure of a lead gasket on the cylinder regulator at the raw water filter plant.  The ten-minute period includes the response and repair time identified by mill personnel.  Modeling was conducted that identified the distance to endpoint, which is within"

The ClO2 solution with a typical density of 12.5 grams per liter is released at a rate of 75 gallons per minute for ten minutes before the tank valve is manually shut off for a release of 750 gallons of ClO2 solution.  In addition, the 49 gallons of ClO2 solution in the pipe upstream of the break is also released.  Modeling was conducted that identified the distance to endpoint.  The area potentially affected includes areas outside the plant boundaries and may affect public but not environmental receptors.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention\n\nThe Wickliffe mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In 1994, the Wickliffe mill implemented the fourteen elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The EPA RMP rule, which was published in 1996, established various levels of prevention program requirements.  Both the chlorine at the raw water filter plant and the chlorine dioxide at the pulp mill are Program 3 level processes.  The Program level is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM program, except that the RMP program focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires twelve of the fourteen elements of the OSHA PSM program.  A prevention program to meet these requirements has been developed for both the chlorine and chlorine dioxide processes.  The prevention program focuses on the following twelve elements:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Pre-startup review\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Compliance audit\n* Operating procedures\n* Incident investigation\n* Training\n* Employee participation\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Hot work permits\n* Management of change\n* Contractors\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, MeadWestvaco ha"
