Cullen, Unit Manager at:\n\nOrland - Simplot Soilbuilders\n1536 S. Railroad Avenue\nOrland, CA               Phone: 530-865-9661\n\n1.  Policies and Guidelines\n\nIt is the policy of the J.R. Simplot Company (EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment. Each manager is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy. The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to it's products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\nIt is the policy of the Minerals and Chemicals Group of the J.R. Simplot  Company (M & C #3) that the processing, manufacturing, storage, shipping, or disposal of products and materials shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of public safety and the environment, and in full conformity with the requirements of the law.\n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company Guideline (SA 01.2) states that the Company is committed to reducing incidents or occurrences in the workplace that result in human injury, illness, or death, and/or destruction or loss to the corporation's assets and to be in compliance with all laws and regulations governing workplace safety. It is, therefore, our intent to provide a safe work environment and to protect the corporation's assets. This guideline applies to all groups and separate operating entities of the J.R. Simplot Company. Emergency plans shall be developed for each operating unit outlining the practices and procedures for emergency medical care, fire response, ev"

Regulated Substance\n\nThe substance routinely stored at this facility would be Aqua Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAqua Ammonia is received, stored and distributed to area farms as a source of land applied Nitrogen fertilizer.\nThe maximum Quantity Stored in the largest vessel at this site is 150,000 pounds of Aqua Ammonia.  The maximum quantity handled would be 150,000 pounds of Aqua Ammonia.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Aqua Ammonia would be the instantaneous failure of a 150,000 pound storage tank (at 80% capacity as limited by inventory rules), releasing all of the liquid, to form a pool with 1635 square feet of surface area. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Aqua Ammonia, based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimated to release 2000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 miles. \n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis aqua ammonia facility implemented the provisions of various anhydrous ammonia codes and rules as they relate to aqua ammonia such as \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; and CalOSHA standards at CCR Title 8 SubChapter 1 \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\".\n\n5.

The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194; and, California Health and Safety Code Section 25503 of Division 6.95. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning. \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic and since this is an ongoing process changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
