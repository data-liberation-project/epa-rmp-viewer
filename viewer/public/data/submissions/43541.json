(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in (the Beaver Creek facility) in Grayling, Michigan which is referenced as the \u00bfplant\u00bf throughout the remainder of the document. The facility is located on 4113 Four Mile Road.  This facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1986 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins.  The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1990.  Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm.  Overall, the facility employs 35 full-time employees.\n\t\n\tGPRI is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\t\n\tThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\t\n\u00b7\ta hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\t\n\u00b7\ta prevention"
