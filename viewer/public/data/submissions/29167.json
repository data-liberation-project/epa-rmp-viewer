The plant handles natural gas and natural gas liquids (which contain methane, ethane, propane, and other like materials).  The EPA considers these materials hazardous (flammable).  Because they are flammable it is necessary to handle them with certain safety precautions.  Mobile Bay has a strong commitment to employee safety, protecting the environment, and community advancement.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as extensive employee training and a standard practice to incorporate safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Additional safety precautions include safety systems such as alarms, shutdowns, and overpressure relief valves.  These safety precautions provide protection for our employees' health and welfare and provide safeguards for the public and environment.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition to implementing EPA's Risk Management Program to protect the public and the environment, the Mobile Bay Plant has implemented the fourteen (14) elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program to insure facility and process safety.\n\nThe Mobile Bay Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state, and federal agencies, as well as adjacent business.  Local officials including our LEPC have reviewed our emergency response plan.  The Mobile Bay employees receive training covering these procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary function of the Mobile Bay facility is the recovery of natural gas liquids from natural gas.  The natural gas is delivered to Mobile Bay via pipeline.  Liquids are extracted form the gas by the use of a cryogenic process.  The processed gas is shipped via pipeli"

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s).\n\nWorst-Case Release:\n\nScenario 1 -- The first flammable worst-case scenario for the Mobile Bay is the release of 178,000 gallons from the old slug catcher.  This event would occur when the old slug catcher was at 100% capacity and would result in 410,399 lbs released.  The worst-case scenario for the flammable mixture was calculated using the RMP* Comp software provided by EPA and was used to determine the worst-case scenario for a vapor cloud explosion of the entire tank capacity.   RMP* Comp provides guidance for performing the worst case scenario on flamable gas mixtures.  The guidance suggests that the component with the highest heat of combustion should be used to represent the entire flamable mixture when performing the Offsite Consequence Analysis.  Methane was used to determine the endpoint distance due to it having the greatest heat of combustion within the flammable mixture.  Methane has a density of 2.500 lbs/gallon, and assuming the flammable mixture consisted of only methane, would have a total weight of 272,292 lbs.  The endpoint of a 1 psi overpressure was a .5 mile radius from the old slug catcher. \n\nAdministrative and engineering controls on the new slug catcher include level switches, which alarm and stop the inlet flow into the slug catcher and a relief valve to prevent over pressurization.  \n\nScenario 2 -- The second flammable worst-case scenario for the Mobile Bay is the release of 378,000 gallons from the new slug catcher installed in 2003.

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Mobile Bay plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are n place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe facility primarily uses the What-if/Checklist method for identifying hazards.  Secondarily, the hazard analysis and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique may also be used.  The analyses are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process a well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nD.  Operating Procedures\n\nThe Mobile Bay plant maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provided a basis for consistent tainting of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process\n\nE.  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Mobile Bay plant utilizes task progressing experience as a means for operator growth and advancement.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a "

After operators demonstrate (e.g. Through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and task in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nF.  Contractors\n\nThe Mobile Bay plant uses contractors to supplement its workforces during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, contractor orientation is provided to the contractors so they can (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) be aware of the hazards in the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nG.  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Mobile Bay plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that acc"
