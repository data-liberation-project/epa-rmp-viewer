This facility is part of the Chemical Distribution Business Unit of HCI USA Distribution Companies, Inc. headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nAt this distribution facility we will handle ton containers of chlorine which is considered a toxic chemical.  The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling and to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, state and local regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the chemical, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nThis facilities parent company is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD).  To maintain membership in this organization, we must comply with the principals of the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process (RDP).  This is similar to the more widely known Responsible Care program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  We are also members of the Chlorine Institute.  Our response plan for chlorine is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64 Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plans for all of our facilities include procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe RDP has many of the same requirements as the EPA's RMP.  These requirements are:\n\t1. RISK MANAGEMENT\n\t2.SITE SELECTION CRITERIA\n\t3. CARRIER SELECTION\n\t4. TRAINING\n\t5. HANDLING & STORAGE\n\t6. WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\t7. PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP\n\t8. COMMUNITY OUTREACH\n\t\nIn ad"

All of these items can be found in Volume I of the HCI Health, Safety & Environmental Manuals.\n\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the branch are located in Volume IV of the manuals.  These plans include a(n):\n\n\t1.  EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\t2.  FIRE PREVENTION PLAN\n\t3.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\t4.  TRANSPORTATION EMERGENCY PLAN\n\t5.  SPILL PREVENTION CONTROL AND COUNTERMEASURE PLAN\n\nThe EPA was mandated by law to define the worst case scenario (WCS) as an unlikely event; the largest single storage vessel losing all of its contents in 10 minutes.  If such a scenario has off-site consequences we must state that in this section.  This facility does have off-site consequences to the public and the environment.\n\nThe EPA calls a more likely incident, many of which will have no off-site consequences, an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  An ARS could be a hose leak, similar to your home garden hose leaking some water or a pipe leaking under your kitchen sink.  For this facility, the ARS will have some off-site consequences."
