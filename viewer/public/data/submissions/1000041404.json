If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cheney Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nThis is facility is a farm supply marketer. We supply anhydrous products to our customers. We store our anhydrous ammonia inventory in one 26,000-gallon tank that will hold 113,594# at 85%, which is the maximum amount allowed by law.  This facility may also have up to 10 nurse tanks that would allow for up to 43,690 pounds of product when filled to 85%.  \r\n\r\nOur worst-case scenario as well as our alternative scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns as dictated by the Homeland Security Act.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. While the state has not recognized the most current standards the company is committed to keeping the anhydrous plants up to the most current codes as time and budget allow.  \r\n\r\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Cheney Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  By definition we do not have an Emergency Response Plan because we require all employees to evacuate the area and call 911 immediately in the event of an accident or release of NH3.\r\n\r\nA stronger bulkhead is planned for this facility."
