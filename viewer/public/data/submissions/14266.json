      "SummaryText": "Our water treatment facility staff and management are very serious about chemical safety.  In l986 the plant went through an upgrade to bring the chemical feed up to OSHA standards.  The  chlorine gas inventory was increased from four 150#,  to three  one ton cylinders.   A seperate storage room and feed facility were constructed with proper ventilation and alarm system.  The concept of less handling of 150# tanks,  would alleviate the chances for  leaks, which were common with the 150# containers.  The inventory, however, was increased due to the chemical provider making limited runs to Havre in the summer months.  The treatment facility has been fortunate that there have been minimal incidences such as a washer leaking or a hose on the feed line leaking in the last 13 years.  The risk for a larger leak is always prevalent with the location of the treatment plant  being on Hwy. 2 .\nIn  the past 2 years the treatment plant went through a complete evaluation to address treatment, regulatory, and safety concerns.  Currently, we will be undergoing construction in August 1999,  to upgrade the facility.  The process of disinfection has been addressed extensively and the choice to go with on - site generation of liquid chlorine has been made.  This will alleviate any risk to nearby residences, businesses, plant, and emergency personnel.   We currently have SCBA's on site for minor repairs.  Our local fire dept. has 600 ft. of air hose that can be attached to two trucks with large air containers.  In a real emergency these would be utilized for larger repairs.  Our facility has an emergency response plan which is a coordinated effort with the LEPC's.  We have not had an emergency drill other than regularly scheduled training which consists of films on the properties and handling of chlorine gas.  A hands on training,  at the plant with the repair kit B is also part of the training.  We are currently revising the SOP's and will be holding training later this spring.  New op"

      "SummaryText": "erators are instructed on the handling procedures of chlorine gas and use of SCBA's. \nThe water treatment plant is a conventional treatment facility that uses ferric chloride, polymer, powdered activated carbon, and chlorine gas.  Our product is clean, safe potable water to a community of 10,000 residents and businesses.  Normally there is 4,000 gallons of ferric chloride, 1,000 gallons of caustic soda, 5000 # of chlorine gas, 5 barrels of a cationic polymer, and 50 bags of activated carbon.  These are all stored in seperate rooms in the facility.  Eventually, with the upgrade the chemical will be stored in a seperate facility.  The plant was built in 1951 so there is limited space in the current plant and regulations have changed drastically since 1951.\nIn the past five years we have had no major leaks.  There has not been any  leaks requiring evacuation or hazard to the surrounding population or businesses.   \nThe worst case scenario was determined to be the release of a one ton cylinder through a container rupture.  There are three cylinders in one storage room, with two on line.  They are isolated  with seperate  shut off and automatic switch over units.  One unit is on standby,  the other cylinder is on line, and the third is on the floor with blocks.  It is usually empty.  The building is located on the southwest corner of the plant structure.  U.S. Highway 2  runs along the south boundary line of the plant property.  The only way a container would rupture is by dropping it from the loading dock or having a semi-truck run into the building from the highway.  The highway has a 300 ft. in elevation drop from  the west hill down to the plant.  It is in poor condition and can be icy in the winter months.  There are no barriers except a fence with a concrete base approximately 6 inches high.  The highway department is going to remove the southwest corner of the lot this year to make a better access to the road.  The fence and retaining wall will be removed.  The ci"

      "SummaryText": "ty has requested guard rails many times in the past with no action.  A temporary guardrail will be requested when the road construction begins.  \nThe alternative release scenario is a more typical circumstance.   The possibility of a lead washer leaking or a leak on the 5/16 \" line could occur from a poor fitting where it attaches to the switch over unit.  The line, switch over units, injectors and vacuum regulators were all replaced a year ago.  The new units will get us through the construction window which begins in August 1999 until 2001.  In determining the worst case scenario and alternative, we looked at the historical problems with the chlorine in the past 17 years.  There is an immediate threat to a low elevation trailer court across the road from  the plant,  depending on the wind direction.  The plant has a high decible alarm and flashing light to alert the residences and drivers to a hazard.   The trailer court is mostly indigent population that is very transitory, making it hard to do regular hazard drills.  The best solution is to go with the on-site generation and eliminate the hazard.  With a conscientious crew, set operational standards, and good maintenance practices the likelihood of a release is minimal until the new construction is completed.  In the past 10 years there have been only slight leaks from not tightening the packing or a faulty lead washer.  There has been only minimal escape of gas to the outside, if any."
