Also, excess flow valves on in place on all storage tanks.   \n\nBoth of these releases are unlikely for many reasons.

We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nDifluoroethane is used at our facility as a propellant in our aerosol consumer products.  The difluoroethane is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping, vessels, and filling area in our facility.  \n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nChurch & Dwight Company Inc. takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of difluoroethane from the aerosol filling system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms, detectors, and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like propellant leaks.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Technical Manager is responsible for the management of these difluoroethane safety programs.\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates an aerosol filling system with an difluoroethane inventory of approximately 143,000 pounds.  Difluoroethane is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Lakewood plant.\n\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nEPA requires us to define the worst case release scenario from the Lakewood plant as the release of all the difluoroethane from the largest vessel on site.  At our Lakewood plant, this would be 53,700 pounds of difluoroethane due to the failure of a storage tank.  The 53,700 pounds represents the maximum amount of difluoroethane that would be contained in the tank at any time.  EPA also requires us to assume that the weather conditions are such that there is almo"
