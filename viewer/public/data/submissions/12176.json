Box 67\nBartlett,  NE\n68622\n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention\nof any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the\nevent an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company,\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to\npeople and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422910, \"Farm Supplies Wholesalers,\nhowever we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that includes the receiving, storage,\nand reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area,  The NAICS code we\nfeel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading is # 493130 \"Farm product warehousing\nand storage\".\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields\nduring the spring months. Anhydrous Ammonia may also be applyed in the fall during some\nyears.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The maximum\nquantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is  68,000\nlbs. in one  16,000 gallon tank.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off\nloading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our\nfacilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at variors times of day and night throughout\nthe year.  Time "

The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity\nas limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) miles\nbased on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (ver 1.06),  as well as possible public and environmental\nreceptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC ( Local Emergency Planning\nCommittee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.\nWe believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses\nare protected by manual and self closing excess flow, valves  so our alternative release scenario is\nbased on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).\nThe distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is rounded to 0.1 mile per\ninstructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the\nAmerican National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA)  standard 29CRF 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\nAmmonia\".
