      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAMP Texas Pipelines, LLC (Aspen) owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Aspen Battle Horse Plant in Washington County, Texas. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nAspen has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Aspen Battle Horse Plant is located near Brenham, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products: \n\n\n\n1. Stabilized Condensate\n\n2. NGL\n\n3. Residue Gas\n\n\n\nThese substances can contain the following components:\n\n\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nAspen encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n\n4.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety- related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nAspen maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\n\n\n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nAspen has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate kn"

Applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A management of change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\n\n\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Aspen incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.
