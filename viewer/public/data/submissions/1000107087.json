This system requires that changes such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Agave Facility promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Agave management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program i"

Compressors and process equipment have been prepared for startup.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe elements of the Agave Facility Mechanical Integrity program are periodic tests and inspections, regular maintenance, trained personnel, work order systems, written procedures and  record keeping.  The program includes pressure vessels, atmospheric tanks, piping, relief and vent systems, process equipment, pumps, compressors as well as dehydration, hot oil and flaring equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training including:\n(1) an overview of the process, \n(2) safety and health hazards, \n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n(4) emergency procedures, and \n(5) work practices to help verify that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nWritten inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed properly, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their assigned duties\n\nInspections and tests are performed to ensure that the equipment functions as intended and to establish a baseline for future monitoring.

Only after the foreman of their discipline deems them competent, will they be allowed to perform maintenance tasks on process equipment.  Documentation of the individual's training and a record of their competence is kept as part of their personal training file.  Like the Operators, maintenance personnel receive ongoing training in their field and a formal refresher every three years.\n\nContractors\nThe Agave Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce for construction, maintenance and testing.  To verify that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Agave personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.  Contractors must maintain an acceptable score on these reviews to continue working at the facility.  In addition, the Safety Group reviews the contractor's written safety program, its implementation, training and accident history to ensure that it complies with the Agave Facility requirements.\n\nThe Agave facility provides contractors with:\n 1.  A process overview\n 2.  Safety orientation and ensures their understanding through testing.\n 3.  Information about health and safety hazards.\n 4.  Emergency evacuation procedures and mustering location.\n 5.

Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\nTraining\nAgave has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\n\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenanc"

This facility is a natural gas amine treatment  plant.\n\nInlet Compression will boost the inlet gas pressure from 850 PSIG up to 1,250 PSIG. The inlet gas will then be treated with Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) to remove excess Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from 4 mol% down to ppm levels. The sweet gas will then be dehydrated to meet a 7 lb/mmscf H2O pipeline spec. Sweet dehydrated gas will be used for fuel for onsite compression, heaters, and electrical generators. Acid gas from the amine plant will be sent to a CO2 Vent Stack with connections to accommodate future acid gas compression for offsite acid gas injection.\n\nMarplot indicates that there is no population within the area affected by the worst case scenario and no residential housing units.
