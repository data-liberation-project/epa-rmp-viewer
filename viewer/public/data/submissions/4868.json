Five-year accident history\n\nWe have not had any TDI releases that qualify for listing in the EPA's required five year accident history report.  We have had one small release of TDI in the past five years with no resulting injuries, property damage, or environmental impact.  A thorough and complete investigation for this release was conducted in accordance with our accident/incident investigation program, root cause was determined, and appropriate corrective action was taken.\n\nf.) The emergency response program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The emergency response program was developed with the aid of Management Strategies Group, Inc., and was designed to meet OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) requirements.  Our program provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We have coordinated our program with the Mid America Regional Council LEPC and the Riverside Fire Department.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\ng.)  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe most recent review conducted at the Kansas City Plant has led to the planned implementation of a timed boiler shut off switch, pressure relief valves in the tank and truck unloading air supply, improved check lists, and supplied air has been installed at the unloading sites to eliminate the need for SCBA's.  At this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety management systems, and in addition we are investigating the possibilities for containment of our rail siding.

There is no residential population within this endpoint distance, as the Kansas City Plant is located in the Platte Valley Industrial Park.

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nWe take a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\nSafety information\nHazard reviews of our processes\nOperating procedures\nTraining\nEquipment Maintenance Program\nRMP Compliance Audits\nAccident/Incident Investigation\nMonthly physical safety audits\nIn addition, we have an established Isocyante Control Program which outlines the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls which are in place to reduce the hazards of isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community and the environment.  Monitors are used in the process and storage areas to constantly check for any leaks, and a visual system is in place that allows remote inspection of tanks.  As well, a buddy system is used in the unloading and tank farm areas to aid in accidnent prevention.\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

Our plant manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.

Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, crushed, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is recieved at the plant by rail car and tanker truck.  It is stored in two bulk tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank farm.  The TDI is then transferred to the process by an automated system.  Access to the tank farm is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.  All personnel must use the buddy system when entering the tank farm area.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at the facility is approximately 430,000 lbs.\n\nc.)  Off-site conssequence analysis scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint was Aloha version 5.2.1 software for plume modeling.  Atmospheric conditions were obtained from the NCDC for the Kansas City Internatiional airport located approximately 15 miles north west of our facility.  Parameters used for the model were 98 degrees Fahrenheit air temperature, 54% relative humidity, 1.5 m/s winds from the north east, and class F stability.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nCatastrophic failure of a rail car full of TDI at the rail siding, discharging its entire contents of 200,000 pounds in 10 minutes, as is stipulated in the RMP rule.
