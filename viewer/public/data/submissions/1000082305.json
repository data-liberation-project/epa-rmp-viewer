      "SummaryText": "The Plan describes procedures implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Agribusiness Division (\"Wilbur-Ellis\") to prevent accidental releases of ammonia that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 5600 Highway 95 North in Potlatch, Idaho (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the forms of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure and aqueous ammonia.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into tender trucks ranging in capacity from 1,000 gallons to 1,100 gallons.  The contents of the tender trucks are sold and delivered to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nThere is one aqueous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons.  The aqueous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank to applicators with capacities of 1,000 gallons and 3,000 gallons.  There are three applicators at the facility.  T"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Potlatch Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1"

The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\r\n\r\n1. Update emergency shutdown section of operating procedures to include specific references to valves and couplings. \r\n2. Modify the daily in season inspection form to include end of day check to ensure valves are locked before site personnel leave for the day. \r\n3. Order a sign that meets requirements and install on side of building or posts. \r\n4. Ensure that the cradle of the saddle is at least one third the circumference of the tank. \r\n5. Update written operating procedures or RMP data to reflect the site specific information regarding colors. \r\n6. Evaluate the flexible lines serving the system are within manufacturer specifications for offsets and length. \r\n7. Evaluate policy to determine if WE staff is required to be present during tank filling and dispensing operations. \r\n8. Install temperature gauge on storage tank. \r\n9. Install pressure gauge on storage tank. \r\n10. Modify the semi-annual nurse tank inspection form to be semi-annual mobile equipment form. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture.

      "SummaryText": "PS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describes methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety, and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing incidents and employee injuries by combing the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
