It is assumed that the entire contents of the sphere are released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\n\n\nUsing the equations for calculating over pressure from the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAG).  \n\nA? The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure equals 0.76 miles. \n\n\n\nUsing Fire Radiation Table 22, page 70 of OCAG.\n\nA? The distance for radiant heat dose of 5 kW/square meter is 0.85 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nAn overpressurization of a tank rupture disk or relief valve results in a release of 12,000 pounds of vinyl chloride.  The entire contents of the tank are released over 2 minutes.  Unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit (LFL).\n\n\n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the LFL for the alternative scenario is less than 317 feet or 0.06 miles.\n\n\n\nUsing Exhibit C-2, page 100 of OCAG.\n\nA? LFL of VCM is 92 mg/l\n\n\n\nUsing Reference Table 21, page 66 of OCAG.\n\nA? Distance to LFL for 6,000 pound/minute release rate is <0.06 miles (<317 feet)\n\n\n\n\n\n PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nMexichem Specialty Resin Inc. has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119).  VCM, the same substance is regulated under the USEPA Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP)(40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\nThe Mexichem,Henry facility, which is covered under a "
