      "SummaryText": "Michigan Turkey Producers (MTP) is a turkey slaughtering facility. We process on average 19,000 birds a day, five days a week. We process very few whole birds. Our turkey meat is cut-up and further processed, sold on commodity market or sent to our cook plant. At MTP we use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for our facility. We have 50,000 lbs. on site.\n\n\n\nAt MTP we have two-temperature/pressure ammonia refrigeration system. The system includes a single stage temperature and a two-stage system that makes up two temperatures.\n\n\n\nMTP follows the OSHA 1910 Standards, RETA (Refrigeration Engineers and Technical Association) and IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) guidelines.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 2 toxic substance as a class involves an unmitigated catastrophic release of ammonia used as a refrigerant. The scenario involves the release of 17,488 lbs of ammonia in a gas release for 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 M/S wind speed, the maximum distance of 3.14 miles radius is obtained. Based on the 2010 US Census Bureau potentially 2,398 people could be affected by a release of the magnitude. The 17,488 lbs of ammonia was selected as the worst case release scenario because that is in our largest vessel when filled to 80%.The worst case radius was determined by using the EPAs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  To date we have not had a qualified \"accidental release\".\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process. The alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a safety relief valve venting to atmosphere. The scenario involves the release of 100 lbs of ammonia in a gaseous form for 10 minutes under atmospheric stability class D, wind speed of 3 M/S, .1 distance to endpoint. Based on the 2010 US Census Bureau Marplot potentially 53 people could be affected by a release. This scenario was selected because it is an event t"

      "SummaryText": "hat is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario listed above. The alternate case radius was determine by using the EPAs RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nThere are sixteen points of alarm monitoring in the engine room and there are twelve ammonia sensors in the facility. When an alarm is activated it will send an alarm to Security 24/7. Security will call management to determine the type of alarm. All alarms are handled with immediate response and investigation followed by necessary repair if needed. Alarm points consist of High Level Float on each system, High and Low suction pressures on each system and High and Low discharge pressures. Two ammonia sensors in the engine rooms, two ammonia sensors in our mezzanine near our refrigeration equipment and each refrigerated make-up air unit also have an ammonia sensor in it.\n\n\n\nWe have an extensive Preventative Maintenance program. Listed are a few examples. We perform weekly inspections of our valve stations. We listen for excessive force while opening and closing. We inspect our defrost relief lines for frost. We turn all valves annually. We inspect our vessels monthly, quarterly and semi-annually and we test our float columns. We inspect the inside of our condensers annually. We calibrate our ammonia sensors semi-annually and we replace our ammonia sensors every two years. We also replace our safety relief valves every five years.\n\n\n\nIn regards to mechanical repairs and maintenance, MTP will only make small/trained repairs. Our contractor will complete any major repairs or projects. MTP is very proactive with changes and repairs to help the system run more efficiently and successfully. With any welding, burning or other hot work to be performed on or near the refrigeration system MTP requires a Hot Work Permit. Proper use of this form requires that the person authorizing the permit exercise sound judgment when evaluating the hot work to be performed. His/her evaluation must consider the presence of c"

We also have a program and procedure for Line Breaks. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that MTP associates, contractors and company property are properly protected while engaged in: Breaking, disconnecting, or opening a line or hose that contains or has contained ammonia, performing service or maintenance on any refrigeration equipment that requires the isolation and opening the equipment, when a line is opened to change a seal or flange and performing tie-ins for modifications and/or additions to the system. A copy of the completed line break is kept on file for the life of the system.\n\n\n\nWe have Standard Operating Procedures written by a local third party refrigeration contractor. The are reviewed annually in house and our maintenance group is trained every three years. \n\n\n\nWe do semi annual awareness training and annual classroom training at our facility. These training sessions have focused on basic refrigeration, entry level training as suggested by our refrigeration contractor and SOP training. We also perform annual Mechanical Integrity inspection and a five-year in depth Mechanical Integrity inspection by a third party contractor.\n\n\n\nAll associates are given brief awareness training during orientation. Those associate who work in an area that use anhydrous ammonia receives further training and safety awareness training for that job. Training is reviewed semi annually with current associates and immediately with new associates.\n\n\n\nAll contractors that work in the area of anhydrous ammonia are given safety awareness training before the job begins. They are made aware of the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and they are made aware of all exit routes and in-house shelter areas. We also review the work related injuries and illness for o"

We also perform monthly audits on the contractor while they are on site to make sure safety regulations are being followed.\n\n\n\nOur local fire department has a HAZMAT program. We work with our local LEPC for coordination and emergency response. A few MTP associates have been FIT tested and trained how to use the full-face respirator.\n\n\n\nTo help improve our safety we meet every 2 weeks to discuss any issues, corrections, and upcoming projects or concerns regarding refrigeration\n\n\n\nOverall Michigan Turkey Producers feels we've taken the right steps to help our facility be a safe and well maintained facility for our associates and neighbors. We are a proactive facility and we want to do what's best for our community.\n\n"
