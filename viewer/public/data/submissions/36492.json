      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency\n\nOccidental Permian Ltd's. Slaughter Gasoline Plant  (SGP) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, SGP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of the Slaughter Gasoline Plant is to process gas for sale.  The plant includes facilities for compression, sweetening, treating, dehydrating and fractionating the gas to the required specifications.  Product streams which result from these processing facilities include ethane-propane mix, propane, butane 12# gasoline, natural gas, and sulfur.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the Slaughter Gasoline Plant process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with the pentane inventory being the source of our worst case scenario.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSGP qualifies as a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.\n\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nReview of the SGP incident records of the past five years, found that SGP has not experienced an accidental release, with off-site impact, from a covered process resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property da"

      "SummaryText": "mage or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSGP maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Hockley County, Texas emergency response agencies.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP plan.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.  We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing and SGP incidents.\n2.  We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental plants.\n3.  We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\n\n\nCertification\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario for the pentane inventory is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nWithin the past 5 years the SGP process has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in 40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specifi"
