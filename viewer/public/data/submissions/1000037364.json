The facility is subject to the Federal Risk Management Program, Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal/ARP) in the Level III designation.  The Cal/ARP Program establishes additional state-specific requirements.  Additional state-specific requirements are addressed in an addendum report submitted to the local implementing agency (Department of Toxic Substance Control/Imperial County Certified Unified Program Agency a.k.a. Imperial CUPA).  \n\n\n\nThe Southern California Cal/OSHA PSM Unit and Imperial CUPA Agency have both inspected the facility.  The Holtville Fire Department periodically visits the facility to assure effective emergency response preparation & coordination.  6th Street Cooling strives to maintain strong working relationships with these oversight agencies.  \n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe 6th Street Cooling Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  The Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prev"

It is the primary goal of 6th Street Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n\n\n6th Street Cooling has adopted a \"non-responding facility\" policy, but recognizes the need to be prepared for an emergency.  A California Hazardous Material Business Plan has been developed and submitted to the local Certified Unified Program Agency; with a copy provided to the Holtville Fire Department.  The Plan is consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements and includes written regulatory release or threatened release notification requirements.  The Business Plan includes the Hazardous Material Inventory consistent with EPCRA compliance in California, and the information necessary to be included in the Area Emergency Plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established.   Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate reports; and relationships with the aforementioned Holtville City Fire & DTSC/CUPA.  The Fire Department attended the most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which provides a comprehensive Overview of the Process.  A strong relationship has been established and local response capabilities have been verified.  \n\n\n\n6th Street Cooling policy includes maintaining appropriate technical capabilities and to deal with incidental releases (as defined by OSHA) safely if and when they do happen.  Key employees have been qualified to use Negative Pressure Respirators; and attend 1910.120(q) Emergency training.  The policy is to support Public Responders with appropriate "

The 6th Street Cooling, LLC is responsible for operations at the site.\n\n\n\n6th Street Cooling is a seasonally operated fresh produce refrigeration plant located in Holtville, CA.  Harvest & cooling periods normally begin in early November and conclude in late June each year.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested produce and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage until the produce is shipped.  The Plant's stationary refrigeration system is supported with portable refrigeration equipment during peak periods.  General maintenance is year-round, with major maintenance occurring in the off-season summer months.\n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, HydroVac&trade; Vacuum Tubes, Stationary and Portable Compressing Units, Ice-making equipment, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  \n\n\n\nVacuum tubes and Pressure Coolers are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators (Room Units) in the storage sections of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas. An ammonia-water diffusion system protects against accidental releases from High-Side Pressure Relief Valves.  Refrigerated storage space is monitored with ammonia sensors and an automated alarm system.  \n\n\n\n6th Street Cooling, LLC is supported by an affiliate company, Western Precooling Sy"

WPS supports 6th Street Cooling, LLC from its Yuma Operations Office.

The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  6th Street Cooling, LLC strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's RMP binder and/or electronically via the \"Web-Based Business Manager\" (WBBM); which is an online RMP/PSM/Cal-ARP management solution.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOver the years it had become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system was historically one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow in order to mitigate this issue.  If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at the designated oil drain points.  Other release prevention measures include:\n\n\n\n - Entrance to the facility is closely controlled & monitored\n\n - A sign-in / sign-out program is established; only authorized personnel are allowed access to process areas\n\n - The facility is enclosed with fencing & gates and configured to discoura"
