As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency response policies have been instituted that include:  operation and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine; notification of key plant personnel during an emergency; immediately available SCBA and protective equipment to be used by trained personnel; an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event of local emergency response is needed.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario as described in this program is the release of the entire contents of a 1-ton liquid chlorine container in ten minutes, or 200 lb/min.  All the on-site chlorine containers are enclosed in a building, therefore the release rate has been reduced to 110 lb/min for the worst-case scenario, a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and atmospheric stability class F was used.  Using tabulated data provided in EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (Appendix F:  Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants - Exhibit F-4), the distance to the Toxic Endpoint Limit (TEL) for a worst-case release was determined.  This distance, assuming the containers are enclosed in a building, is 0.9 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario as described in this Program was based on a chlorine container isolation valve stem failure.  A release rate of 420 lb/day, a wind speed of 4.2 m/sec and atmospheric stability Class D was used.  The dispersion modeling for the Alternative Release Scenario was was conducted using the SLABView Program, v2.0 by Lakes Environmental as well as site specific information.  The data, when modeled, produced no off-site impacts (TEL of 11.67 meters).\r\n\r\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures f"

Mitigation systems in use include complete enclosure of the chlorine supply and chlorination system, an automatic container shut-off device and an emergency chlorine scrubber system.\r\n\r\nNo accidents have been reported over the past five years that meet EPA's reporting criteria (accidental release from covered processes in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage).  Existing procedures will be maintained for identifying and recording future accidents or incidents.\r\n\r\nAn On-Site Emergency Response Program, including an evacuation plan, assembly areas and other safety information has been developed.  This Program has been coordinated with the SARA III Of-Site Response Plan, that has been included with the Program and will supersede the on-site response program in the event that an accidental release extends beyond the facility's boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe Authority will update the program as required and will review the Program every five years or when applicable on-site conditions change."
