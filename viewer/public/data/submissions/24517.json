      "SummaryText": "1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n Georgia-Pacific Resins, Inc. (GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin and formaldehyde manufacturing facility in White City, Oregon.  The facility is located at 1405 Antelope Road.  The facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1963 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde.  The initial construction of the formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1964.  An expansion of the formaldehyde plant took place in 1972.  Overall, the facility employs 36 full-time employees.\n \n GPRI is committed to operating the White City, Oregon plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the White City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the White City Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the White City Plant.\n \n The risk management program at the White City Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n\u00b7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n\u00b7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a reg"

In fact, the White City Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n \n GPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the White City Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the White City Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n \n GPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the White City Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n \n GPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and the local state emergency response team to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n \n The safety program at the White City Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the White City Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n \n In the event of an accidental release, the White City Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department and the local state emergency response team.  Response activities have also been discussed with the local emergency response team.\n \n In order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n \n 1.2 Regulated Substances\n \n The White City Plant handles only formaldehyde in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n \n  Regulated Substance\t Process\t Process Quantity*, lbs\t RMP Threshold, lbs*\n Formaldehyde Solution\n 50%\t Resin Manufacturing\t 69,600\t 15,000\n Formaldehyde Solution\n 50%\t Storage in Unpressurized Tanks\t 123,910\t 15,000\n \n * Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of pure chemical, not of the solution\n \n 1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n \n The White City Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance"

GPRI does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency response team improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the White City Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n \n The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n \n When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \n The RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n \n\u00b7 one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n\u00b7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n\u00b7 one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes (not applicable to the White City facility)\n \n The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the White City Plant:\n \n 1.3.1 Program 3 Processes-"

      "SummaryText": "Toxic Substances - Formaldehyde Solutions\n \n The worst-case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the release of 69,600 pounds of pure formaldehyde from the resin-manufacturing kettle. The released formaldehyde solution spreads with complete diking controls, and by evaporation forms a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling is 0.8 miles. The U.S. Census indicates that 718 people may live within this distance from the location of the kettle. A physical assessment indicates that less than 50 people may live within this distance. Public receptors, which are also located within this distance, include the adjacent industries, the White City Post Office, the Cascade Shopping Center, and two food service establishments. The Ken Denman State Game Management Reserve is also located within this distance.\n \n The alternative case release scenario for a 50% solution of formaldehyde is the overfilling of a formaldehyde storage tank and the spillage of 100 gallons (480 pounds of pure formaldehyde) of solution into the concrete diked area. Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance on 0.1 mile. The U.S. Census indicates that 11 people may live within this distance from the storage tank. A physical assessment indicates that no people live within this distance. Public receptors within this distance are accent industries. No environmental receptors or residences are located within this distance.\n \n 1.3.2 Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n \n There are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.\n \n \n  4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n \n Since 1979 the White City Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, and (3) help maintain the equipment.\n \n 1.4.1.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n \n The White City Plant performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the what-if/checklist technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the plant manager and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n \n 1.4.1.3 Operating Procedures\n \n White City Plant Chemical Division process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.
