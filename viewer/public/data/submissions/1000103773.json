Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios. \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps \nAs part of the implementation of the RMP, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the facility. Each of the program elements has been developed according to OSHA and EPA regulations in order to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the C&S facility. Elements of Prevention Program 3 include the following: \n-\tProcess Safety Information - information regarding the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process description, and equipment properties \n-\tProcess Hazard Analysis - a detailed review of the process, and recommendations to improve the safety of the systems at the Facility \n-\tOperating Procedures - procedures designed to comply with regulations and provide safe practices for the systems at the Facility \n-\tTraining - procedures and logs for personnel training on the covered process \n-\tMech"

The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for coolers,freezer, high-pressure glycol chiller and dock areas and uses a charge of 22,404 pounds of ammonia.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nC&S Wholesale Services, Inc. (C&S) is committed to the safety of its employees and neighbors and operates the Facility as a responsible member of the community. Personnel are encouraged to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use of and risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This process includes protecting the community, environment, and Facility personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for the Facility, which are available to all employees. \nRegulated Substance \nC&S utilizes anhydrous ammonia within a refrigeration system at the Facility. The facility uses approximately 22,404 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \nOff-site Release Scenarios \nC&S has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines, and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances. At the time of the hazard assessment update the 2020 census data was not in Marplot or the CAPS tool. The population numbers in this update therefore are still based on 2010 census. I contacted Marplot and they said they were not sure when the data would be updated.\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios \nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes. Although these scenarios are highly unlikel"
