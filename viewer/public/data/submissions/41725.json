      "SummaryText": "The District maintains an accidental release prevention and emergency response program for chlorine gas, which is utilized during the water treatment process.  Chlorine gas is stored and utilized inside a sealed and contained room.  This room has an alarm system, with backup power capable of detecting chlorine leaks.  The water treatment plant is operated on a 24-hour 7-day a week basis, therefore an accidental release can be responded to immediately.\n\nIf a chlorine leek does take place, there is sufficient safety equipment, such as air packs, a ventilation system and eye wash/showers, readily available to properly handle an emergency.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are visible throughout the area where chlorine gas is stored.\n\nHandling of chlorine gas containers is performed by the use of an electric hoist system.  Chlorine feeders are stored in a separate room from the chlorine gas containers.  This room also has an alarm system, ventilation system and (SCBA).\n\nShould a chlorine leak occur, the water treatment plant is located in a rural area. In fact, the closest residence is approximately 500 feet away.  Any release can be contained in the enclosed area where it is stored.  Repair kits and SCBA are on hand to assist in the containment and further release of chlorine gas.\n\nThe District has had no reportable accidental release of chlorine gas during the past 5 years.\n\nThe District has an emergency response program which is closely coordinated with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) and the local Volunteer Fire Departments, who are also trained in the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and handling of toxic chemicals.\n\nAs funds become available, the District has alternate plans to install air scrubber system or utilize sodium hypochlorite in lieu of chlorine gas in the future."
