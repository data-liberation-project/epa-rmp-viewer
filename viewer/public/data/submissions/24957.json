Facility Policy:  The owners, management and personnel of Cylinder Co-op Elevator Company, Cylinder, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for sale to area farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application to farms for crop production nutrients. Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in: one (1) - 12,000 gallon tank; one (1) -18,000 gallon tank; one (1) - 26,000 gallon tank; 32 - 1,000 gallonnurse tanks and 10 - 1,500 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum amount stored would be about 450,883 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A. The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank (26,000 gallons) at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is about 2.1 miles. B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the five yeasr accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose over a period of 2 minutes or until an automatic shut-off valve is activated. The distance to the end point is about 1.2 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anh"

(ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: Ther facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
