      "SummaryText": "\nThe McComb Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW), West has been successfully serving the City of McComb, Mississippi since the early 1930?s.  Located on Holden Road the plant lies south of McComb.  On average the plant treats 0.70 million gallons per day (MGD) of sanitary sewage and has the capacity to treat approximately 0.95 MGD.  The plant boasts of a flawless safety record with no accidents to report over the history of the facility.  This flawless safety record can be attributed to the awareness and conscientiousness of the administration and staff.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed for chlorine, a hazardous chemical used in the treatment process, to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ?Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions? rule required under the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(7).  This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The Clean Air Act required EPA to develop the RMP in an effort to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.\n\nThe McComb POTW, West is a local government owned and operated facility for the treatment of municipal sanitary sewage for the City of McComb.  This facility plans to store and use chlorine, a regulated substance, above the threshold quantity specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68, therefore must comply with the RMP program.  Chlorine is an essential chemical in the treatment of sanitary sewage.  It is a strong disinfectant and is used in the treatment process to eliminate any pathogenic organisms in the final effluent.  Currently, the chlorine at the McComb POTW, West is stored on-site in one one-ton cylinder and three 150-pound cylinders outside of the fiberglass chlorine building, which is located in the southwest portion of the facility.  The McComb POTW, West plans to store a maximum inventory of 4,000 pounds of chlorine at the p"

      "SummaryText": "lant at one time.  Under the RMP rule, the storage and use of chlorine in quantities exceeding 2,500 pounds subjects the McComb POTW, West to Program 2 requirements.\n\nChlorine is listed by the EPA as an extremely hazardous substance (EHS).  It has a pungent suffocating odor that is easily detectable at very low concentrations.  Chlorine is a greenish yellow color in the gas phase and a clear amber color under pressure in the liquid phase.  Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant, while liquid chlorine will cause burning to the eyes and skin.  When dealing with hazardous chemicals, it is imperative to take all necessary precautions to protect the safety of the employees and the surrounding community.  The McComb POTW, West has accomplished this through constant employee safety training, the use of proper methods and equipment for handling chlorine and preparation of emergency response procedures.\n\nThe goal of the Risk Management Program is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chemicals.  The City of McComb is committed to achieving this goal.  The Director of Public Works has overall authority for the program and overseeing every element of the program. \n\nAs part of the Risk Management Plan, a Hazard Assessment was completed.  The purpose of the Hazard Assessment is to identify hazards that may exist with the chlorine system and assess the risks involved.  The Hazard Assessment requires a history of reportable accidental releases to be provided.  EPA regulations set the reportable release quantity of chlorine at 10 pounds.  The McComb POTW, West has never had a reportable release.  However, since the potential for a release does exist whenever chlorine is stored in large quantities, both a worst-case and an alternative case release scenario were examined and the off-site impacts were analyzed.  Dispersion modeling was used to calculate a distance to the toxic endpoint for each scenario.  The endpoint co"

Potentially affected populations and environmental receptors were identified.  To comply with RMP requirements, the Hazard Assessment will be reviewed and updated at least every 5 years. \n\nAnother element of the Risk Management Plan is the prevention program.  This program covers safety information, a review of potential hazards, operating procedures, employee training, maintenance of equipment, compliance audits and accident investigation.  It is essential to have up-to-date and complete information available on these topics to protect the employees and the surrounding community by eliminating possible hazardous situations.  The City of McComb keeps current material safety data sheets on chlorine available to the staff at all times.  Equipment specifications and the appropriate codes and standards used to operate the process are also available in the main office building of Public Works.\nA hazard review of the chlorination process was conducted on January 10, 2005.  The purpose of the hazard review is to identify all hazards associated with the chemical and the process, opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error, safeguards in place, and detection or monitoring equipment in place or needed.  Possible hazards identified include toxic releases, overpressurization of a cylinder, and equipment failure.  Safeguards in place to protect against these hazards include vent lines and manual shutoff valves.  An emergency air supply is also available for employees in the case of a release.\n\nOperating procedures are available to all employees in the Operation and Maintenance Manuals, which are located in the main office building of Public Works.  No occupied building is located at the McComb POTW, West.  These procedures cover normal and emergency operations of all the equipment and include specific steps to be carried out in the case of a release.  All o"

      "SummaryText": "perators working in the plant have been properly trained on the plant operations and emergency procedures.  Classroom and on-the-job training is conducted several times throughout the year to refresh employees.  There are also plant operators certified to use self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA?s) and training is provided on SCBA?s yearly.  Routine maintenance of the equipment is conducted by trained operators.  An outside contractor is brought in to service the chlorination equipment on an as needed basis.\n\nDue to the safety procedures discussed above and the adherence to these procedures by the plant operators, the McComb POTW, West has never had an accidental release.  Although it is unlikely that the plant will have an accidental release in the future, emergency response plans are in place in the event one does occur.  The McComb POTW, West has coordinated with the Pike County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to be included in the community emergency response plan.  By being included in this plan, the LEPC will respond to a potential release at the facility.  Additionally, the plant has also set-up written procedures and emergency check lists to be carried out by employees in the case of a release.  These procedures outline safe handling procedures for the leaking containers and require immediate notification to the emergency response agency.  This emergency response plan will help the McComb POTW, West carry on its tradition of maintaining a flawless safety record."
