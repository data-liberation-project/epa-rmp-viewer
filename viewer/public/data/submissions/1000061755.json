Antimony pentachloride is a fluorination catalyst used primarily in the manufacture of refrigerants (CFC replacement fluorocarbons), fluoropolymers, and pharmaceuticals. C&MI uses chlorine and chloroform in this manufacturing process. In addition, C&MI utilizes reactor residues containing antimony chloride fluoride - a byproduct from the fluorocarbon manufacturing industry. The utilization of this byproduct substantially reduces the amount of primary raw materials, including chlorine, necessary for manufacture.\r\n\r\nThis RMP submission is the revised/updated version of the one submitted in February 2012. No significant changes have been made to our processes since that time.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nThe handling of antimony pentachloride and of the chlorine, chloroform, and other raw materials used in its manufacture requires certain safety precautions. C&MI's manufacturing process is a closed system. C&MI has developed an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan in accordance with applicable regulations. This plan has been reviewed by several governmental agencies, consulting firms, and was most recently updated by C&MI in December, 2014. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department, county HazMat team, and potentially affected neighbors in the event of an unauthorized release of hazardous chemicals. C&MI is dedicated to continual process and engineering improvements to reduce the amount of hazardous materials utilized and stored, to upgrade the manufacturing process and facility, and to improve process alarms and codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulated substances handled at C&MI are chlorine and chloroform. Chlorine is received and handled in one-ton cylinders. The total inventory of chlorine tanks stored at this plant at one time is 8 (16,000 lb)."

The chloroform, primarily received as an impurity in returned spent antimony catalyst residues, is isolated for reuse in C&MI's manufacturing process. The maximum inventory of chloroform is 12,000 gallons (~150,000 lb); average inventory of chloroform is estimated to be 4,000 gallons (~50,000 lb). \r\n\r\n\r\n3. The worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios\r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of a one-ton cylinder releasing 2000 lb of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released in 10 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be 2.2 miles. This distance does not reflect the active mitigation C&MI has taken to ensure no off-site consequences in the event of a chlorine release. Namely, the existence of a chlorine room with separate scrubber system on back-up/emergency power to neutralize the entire contents of a ton-cylinder and automatic shut-off controls are also in place.\r\n\r\nAlternative-case Scenario for Chlorine\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine assumes the failure of a one-half inch liquid chlorine transfer hose and resulting release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine from a ton-tank into C&MI's chlorine room which is maintained at negative pressure. This scenario does consider active mitigation of the scrubber system with 99.997% efficiency for chlorine neutralization, but does not consider active mitigation of the automatic shut-off controls. The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be less than 0.1 miles with a chlorine release rate to the air from the scrubber outlet of 0.002 lb/min. \r\n\r\nAlternative-case Scenario for Chloroform\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform assumes the failure of a bottom valve on a process vessel containing 500 gallons of chloroform. The distance to the endpoint of 0.49 mg/L was determined to be less than 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The general accidenta"
