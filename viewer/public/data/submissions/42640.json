The Risk Management Program at Anchor Warehouse Services LLC complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements.  This was verified by a written checklist type Compliance Audit, PHA revalidation, interviews and training. \n\nThe NADCO Cold Storage at 970 Myers Dr. in Exeter is under new ownership. The new Owner is Anchor Warehouse Services LLC. Anchor Warehouse Services LLC owns and operates 2 Cold Storage facilities with Ammonia Refrigeration in Central California. They provide seasonal cold storage of Grape and tree fruits.\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n2.    Determine Program Level\n3.    Establish a Management System\n4.    Conduct a 5-year Accident History\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n9.          Update and revalidate the plan as required.\n\nAll of the elements mentioned above are included in the Anchor Warehouse Services RMP/PSM. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at ANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Packing and storage of grapes and tree fruit.  We have 1 Federal and State regulated substance present at our facility above threshold quantities.  Two additional regula"

These are used only occasionally and kept onsite only when they are being used. Regulated substance continuously onsite and over state and federal thresholds is Ammonia (anhydrous) used in a closed loop flooded refrigeration system.\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables, RMP Comp Software, Marplot and Landview V.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.  Alternate case scenario has also been evaluated and not included in the Executive Summary.  All of the details are provided to the State and Federal authorities in written submitted information.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. The system was inspected as part of the PHA/RMP process on 2/16/2005.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our pr"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/16/2005.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, ANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at ANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equi"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at ANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC.  The most recent review was performed on 09/06/2002.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 2/16/2005.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period. The accident history will be updated within 6 months of a reportable release.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTulare County Environmental.
