The Risk Management Program at Anchor Warehouse Services LLC complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements.  This was verified by a written checklist type Compliance Audit, PHA revalidation, interviews and training. \n\nThe NADCO Cold Storage at 970 Myers Dr. in Exeter is under new ownership. The new Owner is Anchor Warehouse Services LLC. Anchor Warehouse Services LLC owns and operates 2 Cold Storage facilities with Ammonia Refrigeration in Central California. They provide seasonal cold storage of Grape and tree fruits.\n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations are outlined by the following major steps:\n1.\tIdentify Covered Processes\n2.\tDetermine Program Level\n3.\tEstablish a Management System\n4.\tConduct a 5-year Accident History\n5.\tPerform Hazard Assessments\n6.\tDevelop an Accident Prevention Program\n7.\tDevelop an Emergency Response Program and\n8.\tPrepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n9.          Update and revalidate the plan as required.\n\nAll of the elements mentioned above are included in the Anchor Warehouse Services RMP/PSM. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at ANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass Packing and storage of grapes and tree fruit.  We have 1 Federal and State regulated substance present at our facility above threshold quantities.  Two additional regula"

These are used only occasionally and kept onsite only when they are being used. Regulated substance continuously onsite and over state and federal thresholds is Ammonia (anhydrous) used in a closed loop flooded refrigeration system.\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables, RMP Comp Software, Marplot and Landview V.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.  Alternate case scenario has also been evaluated and not included in the Executive Summary.  All of the details are provided to the State and Federal authorities in written submitted information.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. The system was inspected as part of the PHA/RMP process on 2/16/2005.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our pr"

The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/16/2005.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, ANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nANCHOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
