The SFI plant uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage\r\nas well as for cooling of manufacturing process lines. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under\r\n40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, SFI has\r\ndeveloped a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community\r\nfrom exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed an initial process hazards analysis\r\n(PHA) for ammonia using a HAZOP Analysis. The original PHA was completed using technical and\r\noperations staff from the Richland Center East Plant as well as experienced facilitators. The PHA reviewed operational,\r\nhuman factors, and facility siting issues relative to the design of the refrigeration system, and\r\nrecommendations were made, as appropriate, to address these concerns.\r\nSFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and\r\nmeasures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.\r\nThe plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a\r\nprogram for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program\r\nalso includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar\r\nhot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.

Findings from the audits are reported to the\r\nfacility, which then must correct the findings and provide written documentation of resolution of the findings\r\nto SFI's Safety Director.\r\n\r\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Plant's Emergency Response Plan and places special\r\nemphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response\r\nwith local fire departments and other emergency response organizations. Many of SFI's refrigeration and\r\nmaintenance personnel have completed 24-hour HAZWOPER HAZMAT technician level training program.\r\nThis training emphad topics such as classification systems and hazards identification; ammonia spill\r\ncontrol and containment; respiratory protection; air monitoring instrumentation; proper personal protective\r\nequipment; medical monitoring; and proper termination procedures for emergency response activities. The\r\nfacility conducts annual HAZWOPER refresher training to keep employees current and comfortable with their\r\nresponsibilities under the plan using classroom discussion and response to mock emergency scenarios. The\r\nfacility also conducts drills during which the emergency response team practices implementation of the\r\nincident command system to respond to mock emergency situations.\r\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the\r\naccidental release of the largest vessel in the systems. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the\r\nregulation requires this review. The following describes the results of the analysis.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration\r\nSFI stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage as well as for cooling\r\nof manufacturing process lines.
