      "SummaryText": "A) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPrecision Valve Corporation (PVC) is committed to policies for the prevention of accidents and providing employees with the resources and training to achieve an accident free environment. PVC is a responsible member of the Yonkers community and recognizes that an incident-free facility not only protects the safety of PVC employees, but also contributes to the safety and well being of the surrounding community.\n\nPVC has a single process hazard falling under the scope of the EPA RMP Rule; the storage of flammable liquified petroleum gases (LPG). Industry experience with such materials has shown that they can be handled safely when proper attention is given to maintaining the equipment that contains them. Accordingly, PVC puts a high value on and devotes considerable effort to maintaining the mechanical integrity of vessels, piping and the associated equipment in the LPG system.\n\nIt is PVC's policy that clear, accurate and up-to-date procedures are required for all operations and that personnel be adequately trained in those procedures before they assume their job responsibilities. Such procedures and training lessen the potential for releases. All employees review the work instructions once a year or sooner if the instructions are revised.\n\nNevertheless, PVC believes in planning for the unlikely. Written procedures have been prepared outlining employee actions in the event of emergencies, including those potentially involving LPG. Since flammability is the principle concern with LPG, PVC has coordinated its contingency plans with the Yonker Fire Department. Generally, it is PVC's policy to rely on those trained professionals to respond to a LPG incident. \n\nB) Location and Use of Propellant\n\nThe PVC facility is located at 700 Nepperhan Ave. in Yonkers, NY. The location of the facility handling the LPG is on the south side of the main building between Nepperhan Ave. and the Saw Mill River. Two tanks are p"

These tanks are refilled by tank truck.\n\nThe LPG is used as a propellant in a consumer device used to spray paints and other liquids. Approximately two (2) ounces of the propellant is filled into each device in a gassing house that is adjacent to, but outside of the main building. Small diameter pipelines carry the propellant from the storage tanks to the gassing house. With the exception of the gassing house equipment, all other equipment handling the LPG is located outside. Forced ventilation is provided in the gassing house and flammable gas detectors are provided within the gassing house to detect leaks and trigger a fire suppresion system if required.\n\nFor perspective, it should be noted that the storage tanks are similar in size, configuration and operation to propane storage tanks that might be used, for example, for fuel storage at a school, hospital or other large public buildings.\n\nC) Discussion of the Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe RMP is required to report one worst-case scenario for Program 2 and Program 3 processes having flammable regulated substances present above the threshold quantity. The RMP guidelines for a worst-case scenario for a flammable substance require the scenario to be fixed using an instantaneous release followed by a vapor cloud explosion and the endpoint for vapor cloud explosions is also fixed at 1 psi overpressure.\n\nAt PVC, the largest tank would contain less than 43000 pounds of liquid and the model assumes that in the worst-case scenario the total release could be 43000 pounds. Based on using the EPA'S OCA Guidance Reference Table, the endpoint would extend 0.3 miles from the tank in all directions. Based on the current census data concentration of population per square mile for Yonkers, NY as reported on the Westchester County and Yonkers web sites, the estimated res"

      "SummaryText": "idential population within the endpoint radius is approximately 3100 people. There is also one small residential day care facility, one elementary school as well as industrial and commercial facilities within the endpoint radius.\n\nIndustry experience has shown that catastrophic failure of such vessels, as postulated by the WCS, are extremely rare events. The LPG storage tanks are robust vessels that are designed and manufactured in accordance with applicable industry standards. Each tank is equipped with two (2) pressure relief valves to ensure that high internal pressure (a rare event)  would not rupture the vessels.\n\nC) Discussion of the Alternate Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe RMP is required to report one alternate release scenario for Program 2 and Program 3 processes having flammable regulated substances above the threshold quantity. PVC has provided two Alternate Release Scenarios.\n\n1. The first alternate release scenario selected for evaluation is BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) resulting in a fireball and the fireball endpoint for BLEVE is fixed at 5kw/sq. m for 40 seconds.\n\nAt PVC, the largest tank would contain less than 43000 pounds of liquid and the smaller tank would contain less than 2000 pounds of liquid. The model assumes that the larger tank would create the larger BLEVE and the total release would be 43000 pounds. Based on the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Table, the endpoint would extend 0.30 miles in all directions. Based on the current census data concentration of population per square mile for Yonkers, NY as reported on the Westchester County and Yonkers web sites, the estimated residential population within the endpoint radius is approximately 3100 people. There is also one small residential day care facility, one elementary school as well as industrial and commercial facilities within the endpoint radius.\n\nA BLEVE is a relatively rare event. It takes time to heat a vessel to the point of failure and this time interval allows for"

The second alternate release scenario selected for evaluation is the failure of a liquid line from the storage tank, which would result in a vapor cloud explosion. The endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion is fixed at 1 psi overpressure. \n\nThe liquid outlet line is protected by an excess flow valve that would close and completely shut down all release if the pipeline was to be completley severed or ruptured. This scenario looks at the possibility of a release that would be of a lesser magnitude that would not be controlled by the excess flow valve. It is estimated that this leak could be 221 pounds per minute. It is also estimated that it would take emergency response personnel 5-10 minutes to arrive at the scene and an additional 20 minutes to control the leak, which would possibly allow for a total release of 6630 pounds. Based on using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Table and following the instructions of Section 10.4 to multiply the the distance from Table 13 by 0.67, the endpoint distance would be 0.1 miles in all directions. Based on using the current census data concentration of population per square mile for Yonkers, NY as reported on the Westchester County and Yonkers web sites, the estimated residential population within the endpoint radius is approximately 350 people. There are no schools, day care facilities or recreational areas within this zone, but the area does contain some residences and commercial businesses. \n\nOther scenarios (such as failure of the unloading hose from the LPG supplier truck to the PVC piping system) were considered and modeled, but the results of the other o"

      "SummaryText": "ffsite consequence assessments were less severe than the reported scenario.\n\nD) Accident History\n\nPVC did have one occurrence of a small release on 02/08/05. The total release was estimated to be 5 pounds or less based on visual estimates and the the type of equipment failure that allowed the release.\n\nOn the morning of 02/08/05 during a routine tank filling from a tank truck, the tank truck driver noticed a very small leak on a filling line pipe fitting on the bottom of the large propellant tank. He immediately stopped filling the tank and notified PVC personnel. PVC personnel subsequently notified the proper authorities and the Yonkers police and fire department responded to the scene. A secure perimeter was established and mobile gas detectors were set up around the perimeter to detect lower explosive limit (LEL) around the tank. The tank truck driver also notified his company and a vacuum truck was dispatched to PVC to empty the tank. It took approximately 2 hours for the vacuum truck to arrive at PVC and approximately an additional 2 hours to empty the tank. Once the tank was empty, the Yonkers police and fire departments released control of the perimeter of the location, but continued to monitor the area until the repair was complete and the tank was refilled..\n\nInvestigation at the location of the leak found that the leak was coming from a small hairline crack in a pipe fitting in the filling line on the bottom of the tank. In order to determine the cause of the crack, the entire filling process was reviewed with the tank truck driver after the fitting was repaired. It should also be noted that the delivery truck driver is also an employee of the propellant manufacturer and well trained in safe handling procedures. The observation of the filling process identified a vibration transferred into the tank farm filling pipelines from the propellant rotary pump onboard the tank truck. This vibration was evident even with flexible hose connections from the truck to"

      "SummaryText": "the pipeline. It was determined that the crack was most likely caused by the vibration associated with 15 to 20 years of filling with this method. The method of tank filling was changed on the very next filling from rotary pump to compressor filling method. This is a method by which the propellant is pushed through the filling lines by pressure and not by rotary pump. This has eliminated any detectable vibration. \n\nThe new method of filling has been documented with the propellant company, is on the delivery bill of lading for the driver and has been monitored by PVC personnel for the last year. We believe this change will prevent any future occurrences of this type.\n\nE) Prevention Program\n\nPVC is covered by the OSHA PSM Rule 29 CFR 1910.119, which requires a prevention program equivalent to that required under the RMP Rule. PVC also has Safety work instructions and Departmental Operating work instructions for the tank farm and gassing house. These are updated as conditions require. The employees are trained with these instructions and the employees are retrained once a year or sooner if the instructions are revised. PVC has provided a secure environment of the tank farm with vehicle barricades, locked fence enclosure, 24 hour guard service and routine inspection both visually and with gas detection equipment. The gassing house is equipped with automatic gas detection, fire detection and fire suppression systems and this area is also subject to routine inspection both visually and with gas detection equipment.\n\nThere is considerable knowledge in the industry on safe handling and storage of these materials and PVC adheres to industry standards in these areas. Considerable emphasis is placed on training employees, equipping employees with the tools to do their job and maintaining the equipment in safe operating condition.\n\nF) Emergency Response\n\nPVC has a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) addressing matters such as LPG releases or fires.\n\nPVC personnel are not intend"

      "SummaryText": "ed to take action on a major release or other emergency involving an LPG. The EAP requires notification of the fire department and other local authorities as required. Once the emergency responders are on-site, they will take control of the area and direct the necessary actions on-site and off-site. PVC personnel would evacuate the facility as conditions dictated as per written evacuation procedures. The evacuation procedures provide for a head count of all known people in the building at designated emergency rally points. PVC emergency management personnel are identified by emergency response vests and have contact with each other by 2-way radios. These people would also provide liaison with local authorities as required.\n\nWhile local authorities have automated equipment to access MSD sheets and provide building hazard locations, they also have paper copies of PVC's EAP, Hazardous Material Report, Emergency Response Plan, Fire Prevention Program and floor plan.\n\nG) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt the current time, PVC has no specific plans for engineering modifications to further enhance the safety of the LPG system. However, PVC does have plans to revise the current EAP in order to improve employee safety and plans to update the information on file with the fire department as well as schedule a tour of the facility with the local emergency responders. These improvements will be completed in the next few months."
