      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nPolicy Statement\nIt is the CWWs policy to operate safe water and wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the South Columbus WRF.\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities\nMunicipal wastewater treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling of biosolids in the clarification process.\nSulfur dioxide is used in the dechlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated water prior to discharge.\nDigester gas is a by-product of anaerobic digestion, which is a process used to reduce the volume of excess biosolids produced during wastewater treatment.  The digester gas is flammable because it contains 65 percent by volume of methane, a flammable gas.  The quantity of digester gas stored is 1,600 pounds, which is below the threshold quantity for regulation under the RMP Rule.  Therefore, it is not included in the Risk Management Plan.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine:  \nTotal Amount Stored:  20 one-ton containers, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.\nSulfur Dioxide:\nTotal Amount Stored:  18 one-ton containers, equivalent to 36,000 pounds.\nDigester Gas: \n1,600 pounds (estimation based on the anaerobic digester dimensions).\n\nThe South Columbus WRF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as of administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule"

      "SummaryText": ".  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a What-If analysis.\nFive-year Accident History\nThe South Columbus WRF has never had a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide resulting in offsite injury or dispersion, or in onsite injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe CWW has implemented an Emergency Response Program that applies to the South Columbus WRF, which coordinates response efforts with the local fire departments Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Georgia Emergency Management Office.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the South Columbus WRF has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems.  The following recommendations for improving the safety of the chlorination and dechlorination processes were made during the most recent hazard review:\n1. Replace the 3/4\" chlorine manifold lines;\n2. Require operators transferring one-ton containers using the hoist system to complete crane operator training;\n3. Require personnel to carry a mouth-bit escape respirator and chemical goggles when entering the chlorine or sulfur dioxide building;\n4. Require hoist inspections that adhere to ANSI and OSHA requirements;\n5. Require all operators and maintenance employees to complete the Chlorine Institute Training Program, \"Safe Handling of Chlorine\"; and\n6. Require maintenance personnel to wear full-face respirators and NIOSH-approved chemical cartridges for low-exposure work on chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems."
