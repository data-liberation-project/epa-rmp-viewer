The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the South Columbus WRF.\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities\nMunicipal wastewater treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling of biosolids in the clarification process.\nSulfur dioxide is used in the dechlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated water prior to discharge.\nDigester gas is a by-product of anaerobic digestion, which is a process used to reduce the volume of excess biosolids produced during wastewater treatment.  The digester gas is flammable because it contains 65 percent by volume of methane, a flammable gas.  The quantity of digester gas stored is 1,600 pounds, which is below the threshold quantity for regulation under the RMP Rule.  Therefore, it is not included in the Risk Management Plan.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine:  \nTotal Amount Stored:  20 one-ton containers, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.\nSulfur Dioxide:\nTotal Amount Stored:  18 one-ton containers, equivalent to 36,000 pounds.\nDigester Gas: \n1,600 pounds (estimation based on the anaerobic digester dimensions).\n\nThe South Columbus WRF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as of administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule"
