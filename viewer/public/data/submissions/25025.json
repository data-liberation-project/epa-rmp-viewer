If an emergency occurred, our policy is tto notify the Shelby County LEPC, and request they respond to the emergency.   Our facility is used as a retail fertilizer plant, it is a 15000 gal tank and associated valves and piping.  The worst case senario would be the failure of the tank, releasing ammonia.  Your model shows a 3.3 mile endpoint and a population of 1011. The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed  (s) intervenes or manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  Them aximum quantity released would be 11908 pounds.  the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .5 miles.  (the most likely potential incident, would be a release from a break in a 1 inch transfer hose release scenario followed by by release of ammonia for 2 minutes,before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve(s) intervenes or remote manual shutoff is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2901 pounds.  The distance to the endppoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles). This facility complies with EPA accident prevention and all state and local codes and regulations;  concerning maintenance and safety.  This facility has not had an accident  in over five years concerning injuries, property or environmental damages or evacuations.  The local volunteer fire department is familiar with the facility and has trained there recently. The facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,.K-61\". published by The American National standardsinstitute, Inc (ANSI) and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by "
