      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nPioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse is a cold storage facility that provides storage space to customers in central Massachusetts and northern Connecticut.\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Facility Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the RM Program. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse facility is located at 149 Plainfield Street, Chicopee, Massachusetts. The facility is approximately 0.4 miles west of Interstate 91 and approximately 0.6 miles southwest of The Interstate 91/391 split.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.   \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse is to provide cooling and storage of refrigerated goods. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains two refrigeration systems containing approximately 12,500 and 14,000 pounds, respectively, of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the storage of ice.  Typical operating conditions range from 10\"Hg to 23 psig on the low pressure side of the system and 140-190 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility co"

IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n\n\nThe Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse operates in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program detailed under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from failure due to over-pressurization.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe RM Program defines \"accident\" as the following in 40 CFR 68.42(a): \n\n\n\n\"The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Hazard Review Revalidation meeting on February 26-28, 2"

      "SummaryText": "019, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (December 2013 - February 2019). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated, as needed, at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the Emergency Action Plan regulations found in 29 CFR 1910.38.  \n\n\n\nPioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse Facility Manager.  The Facility Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Analysis, initially performed in May, 2004, revalidated in May 2009 & June 2014, and redone in February 2019, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pioneer Valley Refrigerated Warehouse facility located in Chicopee, Massachusetts.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency"
