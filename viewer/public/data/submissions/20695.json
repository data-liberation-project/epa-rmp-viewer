We take pride in being a family farm engaged in producing a safe and healthy food supply for our county.  Our primary enterprises involve cash grain farming, producing corn, soybeans, & popcorn.\n\nWe have anyhrous ammonia to provide an economical source of nitrogen fertilizer and have sold it only to our neighbors as a service to them.  We are not a retail organization and were unaware of the need to file this report as we thought there was a farmer exemption.  We are filing because of meeting the minimum quantity threshold and because we are proud of our safety record and wish to continue that commiment to environmental safety and beto being a good neighbor.\n\nwe are proud to live in Barton County and chose this rural way of life because we love the farm and the ability to raise our families here.  We wish to do everything to protect this way of life and our community."
