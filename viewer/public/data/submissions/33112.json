      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nDon L. Moore Water Treatment Plant\n\nThe Easley Combined Utilities of Easley, South Carolina (ECU) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This policy complies with all the applicable requirements of section 112? of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program(RMP).  The ECU Risk Management Program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility.\n\nThe Don L. Moore Water Treatment Plant, is a facility owned by the ECU that exceed the OSHA Process Safety Management Program ( PSM ) ( 29 CFR 1910.119 ) threshold limit of 1500 pounds for Chlorine  (CAS: 007782-50-5 ).  This facility is manned and is required by 1910.119 to establish a PSM program.  The ECU has implemented a PSM program that is unique to the facility.  Presently, the facility exceeds the threshold limit of 2500 pounds of chlorine established by CAA 112r,therefore, the facility has implemented a Risk Management Program based on CAA 112r Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe facility has special characteristics such as number of employees, hours the facility is manned, density of the surrounding population, and public receptors that required the ECU to develop RMP site specific.  The facility uses many technological and managerial practices that are not unique, in fact, are common in the water-waste, water treatment industry. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the facility in ton cylinders and placed in a tank storage area.  Gaseous Chlorine, collecting in the top of the tank as a function of temperature, is piped off by a vacuum chlorinating system and injected into potable water to form a solution of hypochlorite.  The solution is piped to contact chambers for the purpose of disinfecting water.  The equipment at the facility includes a tank storage area, chlorinator room that contai"

A complete listing of equipment, along with block flow diagrams, and pipe and instrumentation diagrams are included in the ECU PSM for the facility.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis, required by CCA, includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative scenario?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion model was performed for each facility based on the RMP COMP VER. 1.07. The RMP COMP PROGRAM was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ? toxic endpoint? selected by EPA of 3 ppm or 0.0087 mg/L, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined, ? to estimate the population potentially affected?. \n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELESE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Don L. Moore Water Treatment Plant involves a failure of a one ton cylinder (a total of 2000 lb. of chlorine).  The conditions for the worst case scenario are pre-defined by EPA (release of the entire amount of gas in 10 minutes).  The rate of release is equal to the amount in the cylinder divided by the time of the"

      "SummaryText": " release or 2000 lb. / 10 minutes = 200 lbs. per minute.  The facility has containment walls, but not to the degree that the walls should be considered passive mitigation.  This scenario includes the following conditions: rate of release 200 lb. per minute, urban conditions, f stability, 1.5 meters per second wind speed, 0.0087 toxic endpoint. \n\nWhen the RMP COMP analysis for worst case scenario is used to obtain the distance, an area of concern can be determined in order to obtain an estimate of the population affected.  In addition, other public receptors can be identified including schools, businesses, industries, and recreational facilities.  Information with respect to the receptors identified for the worst case scenario for the Don L. Moore Water Treatment Plant can be viewed by contacting the ECU at the main office.  Interested persons can also view the RMP of the Don L. Moore Plant by contacting an EPA viewing site.\n\n\nATERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Don L. Moore Plant involves the misalignment of the vacuum regulator value that is connected to the ton cylinder.  This connection requires the use of a lead or composite washer  Misalignment of the washer or improper torsion of the valve fitting would allow chlorine gas to escape through an opening no greater than 3/8 inch resulting in the release of 960 lbs. of chlorine over a 60 minute release period (16 lb/min).  The calculation for the release rate is taken from the EPA reference guide, section 8.1 and is as follows: QR (release rate) = HA (hole area in square inches) x Pt (tank pressure in pounds per square inch absolute (psia) x 1/square root of  Tt (tank temperture-kelvin) x GS (gas factor). \n\nBased on results of the RMP COMP analysis which assumes a 60 minute release, urban conditions, D stability, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, toxic endpoint for chlorine of 0.0087 and a release rate of 16 lb/min. the toxic endpoint would be reached in the alternative scenario"

Moore Plant are as follows: population affected 0000; schools 00; business and industry 00; parks and recreation 00; environmental 0.  \n\n\nMITIGATION\n\nActuation of the chlorine detector would cause the on duty operator to respond to the alarm. The response of the operator would take 60 minutes or less and is an active mitigation measure.  An additional active mitigation system is the remote vacuum type chlorinators.  This system will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine released in the case of a piping rupture. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at the Don L. Moore Plant is based on the elements of the OSHA PSM Program.  The PSM Program is a comprehensive and detailed toxic chemical management program that is available for inspection at the plant.  The program includes the following accidental release prevention elements:  \n\n?    High level and continuous training of the operators\n?    Preventive maintenance program\n?    The use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n?    The use of state of the art process and safety equipment\n?    Performance of a hazard assessment of equipment and procedures\n?    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n?    Continuous review of process information including study of  Material Safety Data Sheet which includes information on the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n?    Chemical-specific steps include the availability of full face respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during tank change outs and alarm response\n?    Chlorine detectors at all storage areas\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has an emergency response program, which is a requirement of the PSM program, which is"
