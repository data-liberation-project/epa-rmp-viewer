Street, Sanger CA 93657\n\nIt is the belief of Initiative Foods that all work can be performed without risking the health of our employees or endangering the environment.  To this end, we have instituted this Risk Management Plan.\n\nOur only regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, used in our refrigeration system to ensure our raw products are maintained in a safe and viable manner.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia on-hand qualifies this facility as a level II Facility.  Our equipment is maintained by trained and licensed personnel and has never suffered an accidental release.  All employees are trained in emergency response procedures to prevent employee exposure.\n\nWe?ve undertaken several studies to determine where our risks and liabilities lay and are taking steps to correct any deficiencies identified by these studies.  Our Process Hazard Analysis was conducted using the Hazard and Operability format, where we studied each piece of mechanical equipment in our anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in detail to ensure all proper safeguards are in place.  We also conducted a Compliance Audit to determine our standing in regards to regulations covering our ammonia system.  We have put into place a plan to correct deficiencies identified by these studies, and expect to have changes/corrections of our deficient areas completed by October, 2009."
