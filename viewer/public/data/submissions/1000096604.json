Nevertheless, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

These devices detect the presence of chlorine, and signal an alarm when the level of chlorine rises above a certain level.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine process at Kirschenman Enterprises Edison consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of chlorine could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine\r\n\r\nAt Kirschenman Enterprises Edison chlorine gas (Cl2) is used to sanitize process water for washing potatoes. The chlorine, when added to water, yields both chloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical equation below) in aqueous solution.  This combination is effective in killing bacteria, viruses, pathogens and other micro-organisms. Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in off-gassing of chlorine gas from water that contains high concentrations of the acids.\r\n\r\nCl2 + H2O &#8594; HOCl + HCl\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the one-ton container by vacuum and injected into the water stream to be treated. After the water is injected with chlorine it is termed chlorinated water. Chlorine levels in the chlorinated water depend on which point in the process that readings are taken but can reach levels as high as 1,000 ppm. In the Tube and Flume the normal chlorine levels should range from 100ppm to 300ppm. In the Pit normal chlorine levels should range from 100ppm to 300ppm. The chlorinated water is also very acidic, with pH levels in the range of 2 to 3.\r\n\r\nThe highly acidic chlorinated water is then piped to a Buffer Tank in order to raise the pH level to a more neutral state of 6.5 to 7 before being sent to the potato wash area. The 500gal Buffer Tank contains a large amount of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which acts as the neutralizing agent (buffer) for the chlorinated water. The water coming out of the buffer tank is termed buffered chlorinated water.\r\n\r\n1.2.5 Safety Systems\r\n\r\nChlorine\r\n\r\nVacuum Regulator\r\nSeveral safety features are built into the vacuum regulators used in the chlorination process at Kirschenman Enterprises Edison. The regulator acts as a safety shut-off valve in the event that the vacuum is broken. A pressure relief valve has also been incorporated into the vacuum regulator to prevent pressure from building up in the system.\r\n\r\nFusible Plugs\r\nThe f"
