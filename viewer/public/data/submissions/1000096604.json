The RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\n\n\nThe facility also has one (1) chlorine system which supplies chlorine to the water used in the following areas of the facility:\n\nPotato Wash Pit\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nKirschenman Enterprises Edison is located at 12836 Edison Highway, Edison, CA 93220. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receivers is 35.345752, -118.862513. The facility is located approximately 960 feet north of state highway 58 in an industrial area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nKirschenman Enterprises Edison is located within the Edison Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed the following faults within close proximity:\n\nUnnamed Ground Breaks of 1952 Earthquake - <150 Years\n\nUnnamed Faults East of Oildale - <1,600,000 Years\n\n\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Kirschenman Enterprises Edison has a 2-5% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Processes\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\nThe chlorine process consists of two (2) chlorine ton containers which are located in the chlorine storage area on the east side of the property. Other system components are located adjacent to the ton containers, or in the potato wash process area and consist of the following:\n\n(1) Water pump\n\n(1) Chlorinator\n\n(1) Buffer tank \n\n\n\n1.2.4 Process Chemistry\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nAt Kirschenman Enterprises Edison chlorine gas (Cl2) is used to sanitize process water for washing potatoes. The chlorine, when added to water, yields both chloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical equation below) in aqueous solution.  This combination is effective in killing bacteria, viruses, pathogens and other micro-organisms. Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in \"off-gassing\" of chlorine gas from water that contains high concentrations of the acids.\n\n\n\nCl2 + H2O &#8594; HOCl + HCl\n\n\n\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the one-ton container by vacuum and injected into the water stream to be treated. After the water is injected with chlorine it is termed \"chlorinated water\". Chlorine levels in the chlorinated water depend on which point in the process that readings are taken but can reach levels as high as 1,000 ppm. In the Tube and Flume the normal chlorine levels should range from 100ppm to 300ppm. In the Pit normal chlorine levels should range from 100ppm to 300ppm. The chlorinated water is also very acidic, with pH levels in the range of 2 to 3.\n\n\n\nThe highly acidic chlorinated water is then piped to a \"Buffer Tank\" in order to raise the pH level to a more neutral state of 6.5 to 7 before being sent to the potato wash area. The 500gal Buffer Tank contains a large amount of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which acts as the neutralizing agent (buffer) for the chlorinated water. The water coming out of the buffer tank is termed \"buffered chlorinated water.\"\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Safety Systems\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nVacuum Regulator\n\nSeveral safety features are built into the vacuum regulators used in the chlorination process at Kirschenman Enterprises Edison. The regulator acts as a safety shut-off valve in the event that the vacuum is broken. A pressure relief valve has also been incorporated into the vacuum regulator to prevent pressure from building up in the system.\n\n\n\nFusible Plugs\n\nThe f"

Their melting temperature is approximately 165?F.\n\n\n\nChlorine Detectors\n\nKirschenman Enterprises Edison uses handheld chlorine detectors when working on or around the chlorine system. These devices detect the presence of chlorine, and signal an alarm when the level of chlorine rises above a certain level.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine process at Kirschenman Enterprises Edison consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of chlorine could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. As such, the chlorine process at Kirschenman Enterprises Edison is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for each process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n \n\n1.3.3 Chlorine\n\n\n\nThe chlorination process at the Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates for only a few months out of the year. The chlorination process utilizes one [QUANTITY (lbs.)] cylinder, with another cylinder stored next to it as a backup. As with the ammonia process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \n\n\n\nKirschenman Enterprises - Edison personnel monitor the chlorination process.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Kirschenman Enterprises - Edison now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
