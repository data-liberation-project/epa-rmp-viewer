(Wabash Alloys) is committed to maintaining a safe work environment for our employees, contractors, visitors, and surrounding public.  Due to the necessity of a timely response associated with a chlorine release, Wabash Alloys has committed the resources necessary to respond offensively at the Dickson facility.  Wabash Alloys has trained HazMat Teams that are able to assess and mitigate a chlorine release in minutes.  In addition, our facility regularly meets with outside responders, local fire departments, and local emergency planning committees in order to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect our surrounding public and the environment.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Wabash Alloys facility in Dickson, Tennessee produces recycled secondary specification aluminum alloys.  The Wabash facility has a Program 3 covered process due to the onsite storage and use of chlorine.  Chlorine is used at the facility to remove magnesium from molten aluminum.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is covered by both USEPA's Risk Management Program rule, as well as, OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule for the chlorine covered process.  This facility implements one combined Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  This program consists of a written management system that complies with both USEPA's and OSHA's requirements.  The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This procedure enables the facility to initiate and complete process changes associated with the chlorine system while maintaining the Process Safety and Risk Management Program requirements at the facility.  \n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled based on equipment failure, therefore, the mechanical integrity element of the program is key in pr"

      "SummaryText": "eventing releases from the chlorine process.  This facility utilizes a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to implement the preventative maintenance, testing and inspection of the chlorine system.  The CMMS supports the routine preventative maintenance program, which in combination with Wabash Alloys' employee and contractor training programs provides ongoing assurance that the chlorine system is operated in a safe manner.\n\nThe five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at this facility during the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to offensively respond to releases of chlorine.  The HazMat Team routinely undergoes training and participates in drills with the local fire department.  The plant has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Dickson County Emergency Management Agency.  In the event of a release which could result on an offsite impact, the Dickson County Emergency Management Agency will be contacted to alert the general public.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility has been making extensive improvements to the chlorine system as a result of the facility's accident history and process hazard analysis recommendations. The chlorine transfer system was physically reconstructed to facilitate access by operations, maintenance, and HazMat personnel.  An expansion tank was installed in the chlorine system to capture any chlorine vented from the pressure relief valves installed on the system.  This improvement eliminated the use of caustic soda, allows for recycle of the chlorine, and significantly reduces the chance of an uncontrolled chlorine release.   Wabash Alloys has also reviewed employee training programs and operating procedures and has made changes as necessary to increase safety awareness among our employees.  The facility will continue to make improvements as identified through our employee participation and internal auditing programs."
