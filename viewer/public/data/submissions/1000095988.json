The primary products produced at St. Gabriel are chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic). Chlorine is used in the purification and sanitation of drinking water, hospital sanitation, swimming pool treatment, and laundry bleach. Chlorine is a basic building block chemical used in the production of industrial chemicals and in the construction industry. In addition, more than 85% of pharmaceuticals are derived from chlorine derivatives. Sodium hydroxide is used in the production of products as diverse as soap, latex paint, rayon, and nylon clothing.\n\nOlin's environmental, safety, and health policies emphasize the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the community, and the environment from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. Olin has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years. One part of these programs is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. \n\nChlorine is the only chemical that the RMP regulation pertains to at the facility. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds. Olin is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, as well as Program 3 of EPA's RMP Rule. Olin complies with the regulation and, in addition, has implemented several elements of the RMP in non-RMP process areas.

Facility personnel participate in monthly communication meetings with the local Community Advisor Panel (CAP) to discuss and explain any facility safety and environmental issues that could potentially affect the community.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions. While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning. The release duration for this scenario is ten minutes with an estimated quantity released of 750,000 pounds. The EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the analysis. The computer-generated model for the largest chlorine tank at the facility results in a planning zone of 25 miles. Based on this analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\nFacilities must also prepare an alternative scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on facility operations. The alternative scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weather conditions. The alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst case scenario. Several alternative scenarios were evaluated prior to determining the scenario chosen for the off-site consequence analysis. The alternative scenario for this facility is the rupture of a loading line while actively loading a chlorine rail car. For planning purposes only, it is assumed that the safety check valve on the rail car does not engage. The scenario analyzed a release of 243 pounds over 0.2 minutes. The EPA's RMP*Comp software was used in this analysis. The computer-generated model for this release results in a possible impact o"

One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Olin utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. In conjunction with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the facility has the ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive accidental release prevention program based on the elements of OSHA's PSM. The elements are recognized as being fully implemented and integrated into the standard operating practices of the facility. \n\nSummarized below are brief descriptions of each part of the prevention program along with details of the emergency response program and trade secrets:\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nOlin maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the facility is operated and maintained in a safe manner. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety"

Critical information on chlorine properties, chlorine production techniques, and chlorine handling is also made readily available to facility personnel through SDS, along with current drawings, and comprehensive operating procedures. \n\nOlin also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment specifications and vendor manufacturing information is used for equipment and system designs. Additionally, the Chlorine Institute provides information and guidelines in the form of regularly updated technical pamphlets. This information is used while conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) and is the basis for developing our operating procedures and chemical process systems. This information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nFor specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related upper and lower process limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process unit. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the "

The recommendations are then prioritized and implemented accordingly. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is completed in a timely manner. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Olin periodically updates and revalidates its PHAs of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and are documented and retained. The final resolution of the recommendations is also documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

Changes to operating procedures are tracked through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Olin has a robust training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Olin operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) the ability to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own and can work independently they are certified in the area by their supervisor. In addition, all operators receive ongoing training and refresher courses on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level and to continually enhance the capabilities of the employees. This refresher training is conducted periodically. Training in operating procedures is confirmed with a written test and walk-through of the process. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nOlin has well-established practices and procedures to ensure that facility equipment is in a safe operating condition.

Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is operating within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). Recommendations from equipment inspections are then prioritized and implemented accordingly. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a maintenance team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Olin incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nOlin has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change. \n\n\n\nPRE START UP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nOlin conducts a pre-startup safety review for new or modified facilities and most changes requiring an MOC. The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective and preventative actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Olin management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility personnel who could be affected by the findings. The facility embraces a web-based alert system and SAP to assure that all potential incidents are captured and addressed in a timely manner. Olin uses Apollo&reg; Reality Charting to conduct formal root cause analysis.

A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. Within the past five years, there have been three releases of a regulated substance from a regulated process that have occurred that meet the criteria for RMP incident reporting. In July 2017, a gas release occurred over 187 minutes which resulted in 297 pounds of chlorine gas being released and sheltering in place. In February 2018, a gas release occurred for a period of 59 minutes which resulted in 160 pounds of chlorine being released and one injury. In June 2018 a gas release occurred over 4 minutes which resulted in 3 pounds of chlorine gas being released and one injury. As a result of these incidents, changes were introduced to decrease the probability of the incident reoccurring. If another incident would occur, as per the procedure, a thorough investigation would be initiated to determine the causes of the incident. In addition, the incidents would be reported to the appropriate agencies. \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nOlin believes that continuous improvement is the key to success in the future. This is especially true in the safety, health, and environmental areas. Olin continuously looks for opportunities to improve our abilities in protecting our people and our community. Olin actively solicits and implements safety and process improvement suggestions through our safety committee, our employee suggestion program, and our Total Quality Improvement program, to solve problems and implement solutions.
