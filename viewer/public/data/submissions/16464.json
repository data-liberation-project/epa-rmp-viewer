      "SummaryText": "Facility's response to chemical safety.\n\nZapata County Waterworks controls chemical spillage by regularly training staff handling chlorine, the only\nchemical in the RMP.  Chlorine is held in 150-pound cylinders.  Should an accidental spillage occur the\naffected individuals would be only those that are in the immediate vicinity and are physically impaired to \nmove away from area of spillage.  The effects of chlorine if inhaled affect the respiratory system.  The\nmain effect is coughing uncontrollably until the chlorine is expelled from the lungs.  It also irritates the eyes\nwhen in contact with chlorine.  Staff working with chlorine have been trained in using the self-contained\nbreathing apparatus to work with chlorine leaks.  They have also been trained to use ammonia to detect\nleaks.\n\nZapata County Waterworks at 909 Jackson is a treatment facility.  It processes raw water taken from \nFalcon Lake into potable water.  At the highest level there are 4500 pounds of chlorine available.  Chlorine\nis used as a disinfectant in water treatment.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that a 150-pound cylinder would leak.  It is highly improbable but the tank would\nempty in 10 minutes.  Where the cylinders are kept is in the chlorine room, which is located in the middle of\nthe water treatment facility, which is in a city block.  The nearest residence is more than 300 feet away.  \nThe only persons affected would be those in the immediate area of the spilling cylinder.  The nature of the\nchlorine is to evaporate; therefore, it would not affect anyone beyond the immediate area of contact.\n\nThe system has the MSDS sheets available.  There is an open canister of ammonia available at all times\nso that the ammonia will indicate a leak before staff gets to the chlorine room.  At that point staff is instsructed to call for backup assistance and to get in touch with the Fire Department so that they may assist with the self contain breathing apparatus to repair the cause of the leak.\n\nThe leaks th"

The leaks have been of less than a pound per leak.  No one has been injured and no one has been evacuated.\n\nIn case of accidental spillage, the local Fire Department and the EMS staff are aware that their support is indespensable and have cooperated in assisting with the self contained apparratus and in being available to evacuate the public if needed.  The local staff of  Firefighters and EMS also provide training and refilling the self-contained breathing apparatus.\n\nIn continuing with the safe operation of water treatment using chlorine new equipment that works through vacuum instead of pressure is being purchased withing the next six months.  Also training available through the safety officer, Mr. Juan Alvaro Garza, is taken advantage of and solicited.  These items should keep the safety record as perfect as it can be."
