We will continue to invest in accident prevention through training and consider safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe 1C Gas Plant, located near Taft, California operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas, propane, butane and gasoline) from natural gas.  The 1C Gas Plant has several regulated flammables such as propane and butane.  We provide natural gas sales that consist of propane, trace ethane, normal butane and isobutene.  Butane storage product contains normal butane and isobutene and traces of propane and natural gasoline.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCrimson Resource Management is maintaining the accident prevention program that has historically been in place at the 1C Gas Plant.  Processes at the gas plant are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard because there are greater than 10,000 lbs of flammables stored at this location.  This summary addresses OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Taft 1C Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Plant operators are encouraged to make safety suggestions to improve plant operations.\n\nProcess Safety "

      "SummaryText": "Information\n\nThe 1C Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for essential process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas pant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe 1C Gas Plant has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and "

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nTraining\n\nNew employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a qualified operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All training is documented for each operator.\n\nContractors\n\nThe gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand that they should do in the event of an emergency. (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas pant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.    Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe 1C Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new equipment modification "

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure these safety features: procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves quality assurance function verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on the following: 1) an overview of processes, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe 1C Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure of safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThe gas plant MOC sys"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe 1C Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, significant environmental damage, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings.  Corrective actions taken in response to the safety committee's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidation.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

This coordination has historically included periodic meetings, emergency response drills, table top and/or factual simulation of the emergency, which includes local fire department and company personnel.  The 1C Gs Plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident."
