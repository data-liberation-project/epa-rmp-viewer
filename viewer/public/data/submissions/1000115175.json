      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\u00b7 Introduction;\n\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances;\n\u00b7 Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\n\u00b7 Prevention Program;\n\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; and\n\u00b7 Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Queensbury.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\nPrevention Program \n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the US EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68). The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\u00b7 Process safety information accessible to employees at all times.\n\u00b7 A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for R"

Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, door interlock system,  electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  \n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  Sterigenics also has implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, Sterigenics has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility. \n\nHazard Evaluation\n\nUnder the EPA regulations, Sterigenics is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and an alternate release scenario.  The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst-case and alternate scenarios for the facility. These scenarios are included within Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis).\n\nFi"

      "SummaryText": "ve-Year Accident History\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n\u00b7 The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\u00b7 The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n \u00b7 On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n \u00b7 Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nSterigenics - Queensbury facility has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Sterigenics - Queensbury are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning committee and the Kingsbury Fire Department.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" Sterigenics - Queensbury also will notify certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics' activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and compliance to regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified.\n\nChemical-Specific Safety:\n\nEthylene oxide is stored in an indoor staging area that is cool, dry, well ventilated and away from incompatible chemicals and sources of ignition.  Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves.  Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and the chamber doors that will alarm with an audible and visual alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
