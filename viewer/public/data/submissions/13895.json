General accidental release and prevention policy of Alliant Foodservice.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\nthe environment.  It is our policy at Alliant Foodservice to implement the requirements of the Risk\nManagement Program by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all\napplicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the\nrisk of an accidental release of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper\nhandling of ammonia. Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating\nprocedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the\npossibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nAlliant Foodservice, 2500 Lovi Road, Freedom, Pennsylvania operates a refrigeration system\nutilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. The refrigeration system is located on the\nnorth side of the facility in an enclosed two story section of the main building. \n\nMechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a\nheat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The\nrefrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion.\nEvaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the\nrefrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated\nenergy. Th"

      "SummaryText": "e refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid\ntemperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system uses\nthis phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through\ncondensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\n\nThe Alliant Foodservice facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain storage room\ntemperatures for various types of fresh and frozen food distributed to their customers. The\nrefrigeration system contains the following equipment: Four screw compressors, one evaporative\ncondensers, one high pressure receiver, one recirculator, one accumulator, one thermosyphon\nreceiver, twenty five cooler/freezer evaporators, a floor warming heat exchanger and a system\npurger. The refrigeration system contains 13,500 pounds of aggregate ammonia.\n\nThere are approximately 100 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel. \nThis distribution facility receives and prepares shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products\nvia tractor trailers approximately 24 hours a day, six days a week.  \n\nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not\nlimited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n3. Worst case  and alte"

This vessels normal operating level is 6,200 pounds of liquid ammonia, \napproximately 30% of it's total capacity. Although the low temperature  recirculator is capable of\nholding 18,000 pounds of liquid ammonia, this far exceeds company policy  and engineering\ncontrols which limits the liquid level to a maximum of 80% at any time.  Considering the\n\"catastrophic\" possibility does exist for this vessel to release it's entire contents, engineering\ncontrols incorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release.\n\n     Worst case release scenario criteria for the Alliant Foodservice facility:\n\n     Ammonia Quantity:                  6,200 pounds\n     Rate of Release:                   620 lbs / min.

The indicated relief valve would be\nperforming exactly as it is designed to do during an overpressurization condition.
