      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Civitas Resources that its employees, environment, property, and the public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this, Civitas strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.   \nCivitas implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policies of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\nFacility Description\n\nCivitas owns and operates Mustang Booster Station in Adams County, Colorado. This facility is in an open area surrounded by agricultural land; the business address is 28700 East 26th Avenue, Aurora CO, 80019 or Section 34, Township 3 South, Range 65 West.\nThe nearest major street is East Colfax Avenue intersecting at Hudson Road and Powhatan Road. The facility is parallel to highway 70. A dirt berm with irrigated vegetation surrounds the facility, making the facility un-visible to traffic. \nCovered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published regulations and guidance for chemical accident prevention at facilities that handle hazardous chemicals, which can be found in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule. These facilities, which handle certain hazardous chemicals, must develop a Risk Management Plan, which:\n1.\tIdentifies the potential effects of a chemical accident;\n2.\tIdentifies steps the facility is taking to prevent an accident; and\n3.\tSpells out emergency response procedures should an accident occur.\n\nThe list of regulated substances under the RMP program can be found at the following link: https://www.epa.gov/rmp/list-r"

This places the Mustang Booster Station under the RMP Level 1 requirements.\n\nSummary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \nThe facility has implemented a Program 1 level Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental NGL releases from the facility. The prevention measures include the dirt berm surrounding the facility, process safety information including SDS for all facility chemicals, fire and gas detection systems, mechanical integrity programs to ensure equipment reliability and safeguard assurance, a facility process hazard analysis to ensure adequate safeguards are implemented, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, and a management of change procedure. The facility prevention program is an ongoing program based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements. \n\nFive-year Accident History \nThe facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents/releases of NGL since the plant start-up in November of 2021. \n\nEmergency Response Program \nThe Mustang Booster Station is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employee and public safety as well as the environment. The plan includes information such as specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of regulated substances, procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release of regulated substances, information on emergency health care, name and phone numb"
