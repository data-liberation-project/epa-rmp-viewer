The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia to provide the proper temperature in the production areas, coolers and blast freezers. \n\nIII. General accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention.\n\nA. Tyson Refrigerated Processed Meats, Portwall Facility  has designed and implemented a preventative maintenance program to reduce the potential for release of ammonia from the refrigerations system. This program complies with the requirements of OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. The key concept of this release prevention program is employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment and appropriate training of all Tyson Team Members.\n\nThe PSM Team is responsible for conducting and implementing findings from the PHA Process Hazard Analysis for the ammonia system. Team members are also members of the facility emergency response team. This ER "
