The regulated substances are listed\nbelow.\n\n  Acetylene (flammable, CAS # 74-86-2)\n  Anhydrous ammonia (toxic, CAS # 7664-41-7)\n  Oleum (toxic, CAS # 8014-95-7)\n  Trichlorosilane (flammable, CAS # 10025-78-2)\n  Trimethylchlorosilane (toxic, CAS # 75-77-4)\n\nA hazard assessment was performed using the United States Environmental Protection Agency\n(USEPA) RMP*CompTM. Model.  The worst-case release scenarios were assumed to be the total\nrelease of the largest quantity of each substance from their respective storage vessel for a duration\nof 10 minutes.  The alternative release scenarios we selected were failure scenarios developed during \nprocess hazard reviews and analyses.  The alternative release scenario for each regulated substance\nis described below.\n\n  Acetylene - A regulator failure causes the two inch diameter pipe to pressurize to 100 psig.  A\n  release occurs at the relief valve at the reactor, causing an explosion.\n  Anhydrous ammonia -The flange on the remote operated valve (ROV) fails, causing a release\n  to occur.\n  Oleum - A failure in the bottom valve in reactor R-5 due to corrosion causes a release to occur.\n  Trichlorosilane - A leak develops in the recirculation line.  This scenario is based on a release\n  that occurred at the facility on August 8, 1998.\n  Trimethylchlorosilane - A two inch diameter pipe fails at the pipe rack causing a release to occur.\n  \nThe following accidental release scenarios were selected based on the distance to the endpoints as\ndetermined by RMP*Comp.\n\n  One worst-case release scenario for the toxic substances (anhydrous ammonia).\n  One worst-case release scenario flammable substances (trichlorosilane).  \n  Every alternative release scenario for the toxic substances (anhydrous ammonia, oleum,\n  trimethylchlorosilane).\n  O"

These zones were\nanalyzed to provide estimates of the total population and public and environmental receptors that\ncould potentially be exposed should the hypothetical releases occur.  Although off-site areas would\nbe impacted by the releases, we believe that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce\nthe potential for off-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community.  Our\nsafety devices include detectors, alarms, and automatic system shut-off features. \n\nWe have had three releases with offsite consequences in the last five years.  The substances and dates\nof the releases are listed below.\n\n  Trichlorosilane, June 17, 1994\n  Anhydrous Ammonia, May 8, 1998\n  Trichlorosilane, August 8, 1998\n\nInformation from each release was collected and reviewed to determine the corrective actions to be\nimplemented to prevent a reoccurrence.  We considers near-misses as serious as actual releases. \nTherefore, the same procedures used for major incidences are used for near-misses.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed an\naccidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The\nprevention program ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of\na release is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of a release due to\nhuman error or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the release due to human error,\nour prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually. \nTraining also plays a vital part in our program.

Manufacturing equipment is inspected and tested\nin accordance with the planned maintenance schedule. \n\nAll existing and proposed future equipment has been designed according to applicable standards and\ncodes.  We maintain records and documentation on equipment inspections and tests.  Precautions\nare taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all changes on\nthe processes are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nWe performed Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to address the facility hazards and to evaluate and\ncontrol where the potential for a release exists.  Employees were involved in determining hazards\nof the processes and subsequent consequences.  \n  \nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at our facility.  Employees have\nbeen assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  We have\ndeveloped specific programs and forms to assist employees in performing, recording, and\ndocumenting the various elements of the RMP. \n\nIn the event of a release, we have implemented an Emergency Response Program in compliance with\n29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120.  Our facility is also included in the community emergency\nresponse plan.  Employees at our facility are thoroughly trained to respond to accidental releases that\noccur on-site.
