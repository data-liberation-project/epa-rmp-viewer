Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility is regulated under 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency\n\nResponse and\n\n29 CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Plans and Fire Prevention Plans. Chemicals Incorporated\n\nBay city Site fully\n\ncomplies with these regulations with employee training and written plans. Additionally, the facility\n\nclosely communicates with local emergency response group.\n\n2. Source and Substances Handled\n\nPrimary Activities: Organic Chemicals and specialty chemicals Toll Manufacturer\n\n\n\nUse of Substances:\n\nPropylene oxide: 45000 lbs (max), in Storage Tanks\n\n3.I.a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario: Failure of tank holding 45000 lbs of propylene oxide with no\n\nemergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 138 minute period. The\n\n45000 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 1.2 miles.\n\nI.b. Toxic Alternative Scenario: 1\" Hole in liquid space of propylene oxide tank, 42\" liquid above hole,\n\nreleasing propylene oxide for 30 minutes at the rate of 203 lbs/min within a diked area with sumps\n\nand sprinkler/deluge water available. The material released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic\n\nendpoint radius of 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde Solution (Max 37% in water): 45000 lbs in Storage Tank.\n\n3.I.a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario: Failure of tank holding 45000 lbs of formaldehyde solution with no\n\nemergency response resulting in the complete release of contents at the rate of 4.2 pounds per minute. The 45000 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.8 miles.\n\nI.b. Toxic Alternative Scenario: 1\" Hole in liquid space of propylene oxide tank, 48\" liquid above hole,\n\nreleasing formaldehyde solution for 30 minutes at the rate of 1.83 lbs/min within a diked area with sumps\n\nand deluge water available. The material released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic\n\nendpoint radius of 0.2 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release "

Five Year Accident History Summary\n\nNo Accidents involving Propylene oxide.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nChemicals Incorporated's Emergency Response Program is tailored to the varied processes inherent\n\nto a small specialty chemical toll manufacturer. The plan rests on response trained operators and a 24 hour a day emergency coordinator along with two alternate coordinators to handle notifications and request for response from outside agencies such as Matagorda Count LEPC, Bay City Fire Department, and ambulance services.\n\nSpecial equipment and personal protective gear is on hand for containing releases. Training of\n\nemployees is conducted to repair any possible leaking lines, tanks/containers. Additionally, the facility has 2.4 million gallon fire water reservoir and associated fire suppression/deluge system for fire fighting\n\nservice.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAdditional passive and active mitigation strategies, including automated deluge systems, are being\n\nevaluated and installed for various equipment and tanks.\n\n\n\n"
