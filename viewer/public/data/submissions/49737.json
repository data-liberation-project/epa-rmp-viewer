This\ncommitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas\nsuch as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Kings\nCounty hazardous materials teams.\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 490 F Street in\nLemoore, California. We have one RMP-regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to\nprovide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese. The maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility is\napproximately 70,000 lb.\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set\nout under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM\nstandard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our\nstationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with o"

Any findings related\nto the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial\nstartup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\nshutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to\noperators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher\ntraining is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed. All training will be documented\nand validated by employees on the LFC Training Tracking System.\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper\noperations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage\ntanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified\nby the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Leprino Foods Company to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntec"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into\noperation.\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under\nthe RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective\nactions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a\ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation\nleading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are\nretained for a minimum of 5 years.\nEmployee Participation\nLeprino Foods Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\neffort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention\nissues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as\npart of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard\nanalyses in particular.\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.\nPrior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out"

Due to\nour stringent release prevention policies, no reportable quanity (RQ) releases have occurred.\n5 Emergency Response Plan\nLeprino Foods Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical\ntreatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as postincident\ndecontamination of affected areas.\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
