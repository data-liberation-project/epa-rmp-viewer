This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release:\r\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements.  Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Isabela Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\r\nIsabela Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is delivered from the San Juan Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Isabela Filtration Plant could have a storage maximum volume of twelve thousand (12,000) pounds distributed in six (6) containers.  The containers are connected to regulated valves, from which the chlorine flows to the chlorination and finally to injectors.  The chlorinated water sent in different injections points along the process of the plant. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk M"

This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Marplot and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 10128 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  An environmental receptor (wetland) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario:\r\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a valve seal rupture.  In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.2 miles 121 public receptors were identified. In the Marplot and US Census 2010 identified no receptors but the most recent map revision some residence were identified . Environmental receptors are located within this radio area.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \r\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOPs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes"
