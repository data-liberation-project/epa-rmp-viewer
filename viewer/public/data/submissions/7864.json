The program in place covers all aspects of OSHA's CFR 1910.\n\nRCSA has a program for employees covering lock-out tag-out and Personnel Protective Clothing (PPE), PPE testing emergency response training, and confined space training. Yearly inspections are performed on all aspects of the process along with outside inspectors in the evaluation of the process.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance\n\nRCSA is a refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigerant. It is located at 5501 Corrugated Road, Sandston, Virginia 23150. The warehouse, which was completed in 1990, is a 72,600 square feet facility designed to freeze and store up to 1,773,400 cu. Ft.of frozen commodities as low as -20 degrees fahrenheit. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two stage recirculated system. It utilizes a roof  top evaporative condenser.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario is the high-pressure receiver, which can hold up to 3274 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. If this vessel was damaged and all 3274 pounds released over a 10 minute period (the required assumption by the Risk Management Program parameters), 200 ppm could reach 0.7 m"

There is no passive mitigation system to mitigate the release of gas.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario, which is more likely, would be a pipe leak that could leak approximately 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within a 10 minute period. A toxic endpoint level of 200 ppm is 0.2 miles from the release point as calculated by the OCA Guideance Analysis.\n\nThe facility was designed so that material handling equipment would not be able to accidentally damage ammonia piping. The facility is controlled by a computer system that can assist in reducing the quantity of ammonia released. The computer system can be controlled from off-site also.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe engineers have been trained to follow the PSM program guidelines established for this facility. Employees participate in regular safety meetings, safety inspections, and annual training classes on ammonia safety.\n\nA preventative maintenance program and facility check lists provide routine inspection of the refrigeration system. An annual inspection following the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IIAR) guidelines is performed on the equipment. The facility design incorporated good safety practices for ammonia refrigeration.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\n There have been no accidental releases at this facility. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program includes coordination with the local LEPC and the Henrico County Fire Department.\n                 \nThe facility engineers have received the 24 hour Emergency Responder Training and receive an annual 8 hour Responder Refresher Course.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRCSA plans to improve it's safety program in 1999 in several ways. A program has been put into place to evaluate the Process Safety Management Program annually. A training program has been put in place to inform and provide additional in"
