      "SummaryText": "Fort Detrick is an active US Army Medical Installation which houses the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI-Frederick) and 37 other mission partners located in Frederick, Maryland.  Its primary mission includes biomedical research and development, medical materiel management and global telecommunications.  Fort Detrick is situated on approximately 1,200 acres and is 46 miles northwest of Baltimore City and 45 miles north of Washington, DC.  Approximately 7,800 military, federal and contract personnel are employed by Fort Detrick.\n\nFort Detrick uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in quantities greater than 2,500 lbs and therefore requires the development of a Risk Management Program according to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Since the WWTP and WTP are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) Process Safety Management Rule (PSM), both chlorine storage systems are considered Program Level 3 processes under 40 CFR 68.  Chlorine is the only chemical stored at a facility operated by Fort Detrick that exceeds threshold quantities of 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  \n\nAlthough Fort Detrick is responsible for the WTP and WWTP, the facilities are located approximately two miles East of the Fort Detrick fenceline and are about a half mile apart.  Since this RMP is for chlorine stored at the two different locations, and only one facility Latitude and Longitude could be given in Section 1.5 of the RMP Submit software, a location between the two facilities was sited.  In the event of an emergency, this coordinate should bring any emergency vehicles to the correct general location of the chlorine cylinders.\n\n The Risk Management Program at Fort Detrick is designed to prevent a catastrophic release of chlorine gas via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical"

Key participants in this program include the Fort Detrick Environmental Quality Control Committee, Environmental Management Office (EMO), Directorate of Installation Services, Safety Office, Industrial Hygiene Office, Emergency Operations Center, Staff Judge Advocate, Fire and Emergency Services Division, Public Affairs Office, the Provost Marshal Office and the WTP and WWTP facility operators.  \n\nThe prevention program for Fort Detrick\u00bfs WTP and WWTP mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements and consists of a combination of engineering controls and administrative procedures.  For example, vacuum regulators are mounted directly on the chlorine tanks to minimize the possibility of a leak in the lines, and all operators have been certified by the Maryland State Board of Waterworks and Waste Systems Operations.  Additionally, the chlorine sensors have audible alarms and lights that automatically alert the Fire and Emergency Services Division.  New this year, the two chlorine injection points have been consolidated into one point to allow for easier monitoring.  The PHA update for Fort Detrick\u00bfs WTP and WWTP chlorination systems was performed on 22 April 2009 and revealed no significant additional safety issues that need to be addressed and only minor corrections to information provided in the previous PHA.  \n\nFort Detrick has not had any accidents involving chlorine gas with any off-site or on-site impacts in the past five years.  Information about the off-site consequence analysis is included in the RMP Submit.\n\nAs part of the Emergency Response Program, Fort Detrick\u00bfs WTP and WWTP operators do not act as first responders in the event of a chlorine release.  Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services Division personnel act as first responders.  They are fully trained and equipped to handle a release or other chlorine emergency to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored.  They review their emergency response procedures periodically and continuously train their p"

The Fort Detrick Fire and Emergency Services Division is a member of the local community response network with a mutual aid agreement in place to assist or be assisted by the Frederick County Fire and Rescue Services.  Procedures to notify the public and local agencies have also been developed and are documented in the Fort Detrick Integrated Contingency Plan.  Fort Detrick is currently working on a new Facility Emergency Response Plan.  This plan is due to be final in June 2009 and will include chlorine operations at the WTP and WWTP."
