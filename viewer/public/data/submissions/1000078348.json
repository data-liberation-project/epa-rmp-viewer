      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION - The Coyote Springs Plant is a fossil fueled power generating facility consisting of two units operated by Portland General Electric (PGE). Unit 1 is owned by PGE and is capable of generating 300 MW of electricity by burning either natural gas (primary) or diesel fuel (secondary). Unit 2 burns only natural gas, is owned by Avista Corporation, and is capable of generating 300 MW of electricty. PGE is dedicated to minimizing adverse impacts on the environment. As part of our program for minimizing air pollution emissions, the Coyote Springs Plant utilizes a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce releases of nitrogen oxides to the air. The SCR system injects ammonia into the combustion exhaust gases where it reacts with the nitrogen oxides to form nitrogen and water vapor. Anhydrous ammonia for use in the SCR is stored on site in a tank with a capacity of 65,890 lbs. Anhydrous ammonia is one of the chemicals identified by EPA in Sections 112 of the Clean Air Act and this RMP has been developed by PGE to meet the requirements of that act. \n\n\n\nPLANT SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE - Coyote Springs is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 2011. Coyote Springs has a fully implemented OSHA process safety management program for handling anhydrous ammonia and there have been no release accidents since the plant started operation in 1995. Plant personnel have received extensive training in safety procedures and emergency response actions. Anhydrous ammonia is a common chemical used as fertilizer or refrigerant and, since local industry is primarily agriculture or food processing, it is a high use chemical in this community. Therefore, local emergency response groups have received specialized training in anhydrous ammonia accidents and PGE has played a key role in helping to develop an integrated community emergency response plan. In addition to the Coyote Springs Plant, participants include the Morrow County LEPC, local law enf"
