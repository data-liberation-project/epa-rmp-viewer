              "Description": "Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThis process is a batch style process for a specific agricultural product.  The last production of this product ended in early 2007 with the ammonia tank emptied and decontaminated in 2008.  The product is scheduled to be produced in the future, therefore, the material will be maintained on the RMP plan.  Prior to production of the product, all operating procedures and skill set training in preparation for production will be reviewed, updated, and completed through the Management of Change Process similar to a new product introduction.  \n\nThis system is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit  the amount of ammonia held in the storage tank. The unloading of ammonia tank trucks is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\nAmmonia pump (10-110-045B)\n\nThe storage tank is housed in a concrete diked area. All nozzles on the tank are fitted with excess flow valves except for nozzles with pressure relief valves. A local level indicator is available on the tank with a transmitter conveying  the level measurement into the control room. This instrument is used to monitor and control the tank level.\n\nThe pressure relief valves are tested annually. The entire system undergoes annual maintenance which includes: external inspection, checks for any leaks, bolt tightness on the manway. \n\nAmmonia is transferred to an ammonia / water mixer to prepare a solution that is pumped to a surge tank . The solution is then pumped to the chemical processing equipment and used to manufacture an agricultural product.\n\nAll changes to this system fall under the Plant's process safety management of change procedure. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted for all changes.",

One cylinder will be connected to the vaporization process equipment at a time. A maximum of eight cylinders will be allowed in the dispensing or vaporizer building at any time.\n\nUnique pipe fittings are utilized to ensure that only chlorine is transferred to the process. The piping system is designed to minimize potential leak spots.\n\nThe chlorine vaporizer or dispensing building is inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems.

              "Description": "Anhydrous trimethylamine is unloaded from a high pressure, bulk trailer into a storage tank. Unique pipe fittings are used to ensure that only the correct raw material can be unloaded into the storage tank. The piping system design minimizes potential leak spots by utilizing the latest equipment such as \"mag drive\" pumps (no seals), excess flow valve on the bottom of the storage tank (stops flow if excessive, such as a leak), rupture disk followed by a relief valve, and low emission packing valves. The secondary containment area for the storage tank is designed to hold or contain 110% of the storage tank volume. All fumes from the tank farm and process vessels are burned in a thermal oxidizer.\n\nReactor 140-001\n\nReactor 220-001\n\nPump   220-004\n\n\n\nThe unloading system, storage tank and processing equipment are equipped with instruments for monitoring process variables. The system is designed to prevent incidents such as tank over filling and over pressurization. The unloading process and storage tank are monitored continuously by control and interlock systems. In addition, the process is also monitored continuously by trained operating personnel.\n\n\n\nThe tank farm area is inspected regularly for leaks and other potential problems. The process building is continuously monitored for trimethylamine as well as other chemicals. Upon detection of a trimethyamine leak in the process building the system will alarm and the trained operating staff will respond accordingly to isolate all equipment containing the amine.\n\n\n\nThe plant electrical systems meet all codes and guidelines for a facility handling flammable liquids. The unloading area, tank farm, and process building are equipped with appropriate fire-fighting systems.\n\n\n\nThe process is governed by well-documented operating procedures and administrative controls which limit the amount of trimethylamine held in the storage tank. The unloading of raw material delivery vehicles is also governed by Plant policies and operating procedures. Operators are trained and certified.\n\n\n\nAll changes fall under the Plant's process safety managment of change procedure. PHAs are conducted for all changes.",
