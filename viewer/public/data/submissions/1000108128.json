In this processing area, chemicals are prepped and pumped to the manufacturing line. The worst-case scenario is a release from the pump system, which could release TDI from a process tank with a maximum capacity of 4,900 gallons. The Pump Room is located indoors west of the TDI Process Tank Room (Figure 2). The pump room is open to the manufacturing area on two sides, but the envelope of the building provides containment in the event of an accidental release. The worst-case release scenario analysis performed in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.25 indicates that the toxic endpoint will not extend beyond the property and will not affect public receptors. \n\nThe Facility is new; therefore, it has not had any accidental releases. As mentioned above, the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with a worst-case release is less than the distance to a public receptor. Finally, Healthcare Glendale, LLC has coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, per 40 CFR \u00a768.10(f), the Facility meets the eligibility requirements for RMP Program 1.\n\nSections 2 and 3 discuss the Facility\u2019s accidental release prevention and emergency response policies, respectively. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP registration forms are included in Section 4 of the RMP.

      "SummaryText": "Healthcare Glendale, LLC (also known as MLILY) constructed a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility (Facility) located at 6605 N. Sarival Road in Litchfield Park, Maricopa County, Arizona (Figure 1).   MLILY will produce slabstock polyurethane foam by chemically reacting polyether polyols, diisocyanates, and minor additives. The cured foam will then be incorporated into foam mattresses. Processes at the Facility fall within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 326150, Urethane and Other Foam Product (except Polystyrene) Manufacturing. \n\nThe manufacturing process utilizes Mondur TD Grade A (TD80) as a raw material, generically referred to as Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The Facility comprises four (4) TDI storage tanks with a capacity of 25,000 gallons each and four (4) TDI storage tanks with a capacity of 4,900 gallons each (i.e., 330,000 lbs and 45,000 lbs per tank respectively based on the density provided in the safety data sheet). The tanks are located indoors on the northeast corner of the Facility. TD80 contains 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanate (2,4-TDI, CAS # 584-84-9) and 2,6-Toluene Diisocyanate (2,6-TDI, CAS # 91-08-7). The threshold quantity (TQ) for these chemicals is 10,000 pounds (lbs). Due to the exceedance of the TQ, the Facility is required to have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR 68. This RMP has been developed based on the worst-case scenario for each of the processes at the Facility per 40 CFR \u00a768.25. The Facility does not store or utilize any flammable chemicals in excess of the TQ.  \n\nProcess 1 is the TDI unloading process at the Facility. TDI will be delivered in tanker trucks to the northern side or the northeast corner of the building, where the TDI will be pumped directly into storage tanks via ports through the wall of the Facility (Figure 2). Sloped concrete would guide any TDI released during unloading to a concrete containment pit with a design capacity of greater than 15,000 gallons. Tankers are"
