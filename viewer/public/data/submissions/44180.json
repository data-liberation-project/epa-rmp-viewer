      "SummaryText": "United Cooperative - South Beaver Dam\nCompliance Contact:  Larry Stensrud\nFacility Telephone:  (920) 887-1756\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management and employees of the South Beaver Dam facility are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State (Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Chapter Comm 43) and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the Beaver Dam Fire Department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  This facility is a farm cooperative.  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia will be received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The anhydrous ammonia system will consist of two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The existing tank at the facility was emptied, pipes disconnected and tank disassembled in the summer of 2004, but will be re-piped and re-assembled in late 2005 or early 2006.  Additionally, a second 18,000 gallon storage tank will be moved to the facility in late 2005 or early 2006.  The tank will be coming from the Juneau facility.  When the two tanks are assembled in late 2005 or early 2006, a new hazard review and a new compliance audit will be completed at the facility.

The maximum fill level of each tank will be 85% of the total tank capacity, which will be controlled by a liquid level gauge.  The facility will maintain fiftyseven (57) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, twelve (12) 1,450 gallon nurse tanks, three (3) 2,000 gallon nurse tank trailers and one (1) 400 gallon applicator tank for customer use.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the nurse tanks and applicator tank will be approximately 354,000 pounds.  This facility is loaded by railcar (for fertilizer manufacturing - see below) and transport truck and may have up to four (4) railcars, disconnected from the locomotive, at the facility.  The maximum quantity stored in the four railcars would be approximately 600,000 pounds.  Therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the facility will be approximately 1,112,000 pounds. This would occur when all of the nurse tanks, the on-site storage tanks and four (4) railcars are at the maximum fill level of 85%.  The nurse tank filling procedure will be performed by our own employees.\n\nUsually once a year, the facility brings in a contractor with a portable reactor to manufacture liquid fertilizer (10-34-0, ammonium phosphate solution).  The contractor is Agriliance LLC out of Mason City, Iowa.  The liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in railcars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered in railcars and the most anhydrous ammonia railcars at the facility at any one time is four (4).  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the"

The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 150,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.19 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the railcar is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from a storage tank to a nurse tank.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.56 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations (Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Chapter Comm 43).  The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia (Program 2).
