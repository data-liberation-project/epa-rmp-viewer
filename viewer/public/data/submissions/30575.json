      "SummaryText": "Superior operates a chemical distribution facility located at 4211 Bramers Lane, Louisville, Kentucky.  The primary operations consist of unloading, storage, repackaging, custom blending, and distribution of chemicals to retail and wholesale customers.  A wide range and variety of solvents and industrial chemicals are handled at the facility.\n\nCurrently, Superior manages methyl formate (CAS 107-31-3) in excess of EPA?s threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of methyl formate that can be stored at this location is 45,000 pounds, or approximately 1 cargo tank..\n\nThe Louisville facility is identified as a stationary source, based on the criteria that Superior leases the property, the processes are contained within the property boundary, and no other companies operate on the property.  Therefore Superior is required to comply and file a RMP for all covered processes within the facility boundary that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accidental release prevention rule (40 CFR ?68) and with other applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA ???.  \n\nTraining is conducted as part of various regulatory and voluntary programs, such as OSHA, ISO 9001 and the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) programs.  This training consists of classroom and on-the-job training.  \n\nThere have been no accidents or releases involving methyl formate at the facility to date.\n\nSuperior has an Emergency Action program and does not respond to major releases.  However, the Emergecny Action Plan  has been sent to local agencies in order to coordinate any possible response actions."
