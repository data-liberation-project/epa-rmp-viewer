Furthermore Carpenter Co. is committed to protecting the health and welfare of its employees, the surrounding community and the environment.  To achieve this goal procedures, policies, preventative maintenance and training is provided. Accidental Release prevention begins with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, safe handling procedures and checklist used as well as training imparted to our personnel. In addition regular audits and inspections are conducted to ensure our personnel are aware of the safety requirements and implementing proper procedures. \r\n The Lakeland Division of Carpenter Co. utilizes an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) based on the requirements of  OSHA's Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response Operations  regulation (29 CFR 1910.120) as well as state and local regulations to manage emergency response activities at the facility. The Contingency Plan for the Lakeland Division includes procedures for proper notification of the local fire department, the police department, and the local hospital, when and if such notification becomes necessary.  The implementation of the ICP at the facility is directly related to the degree of training given to the Carpenter Co. employees in regard to chemical releases and emergencies, fire evacuation and preparation for response to the effect of natural disasters.  The Lakeland Division's attention to Accidental Release Prevention is evidenced by the facility's not having a  release of toluene diisocyanate during the previous fire years.  \r\n\r\n2.\tFACILITY DESCRIPTION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, is located at 5150 Fro"

      "SummaryText": "ntage Road South in Lakeland, Florida.  The area around the facility is comprised of other industrial plants.  The Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, employs approximately 146 full time employees.  The facility manufactures polyurethane foam products for use in carpet cushioning, bedding and furniture applications.  The polyurethane foam manufacturing process utilizes toluene diisocyanate (TDI) [unspecific isomers], CAS# 2647-62-5, as a reactant to produce foam. The Carpenter Co., Lakeland facility has a total TDI storage capacity of approximately 937,716 pounds.  The facility maintains a maximum of three railcars each with approximately 190,000 pounds, one internal TDI storage tank with a capacity of 313,013 pounds, one prepolymer mixing tank with a capacity of 76040 pounds and one prepolymer day tank with a capacity of 27391 pounds. The mixture in the prepolymer mixing tank and day tank consists of 50 percent TDI.  All process tanks are located inside the building within concrete containments. The railcars are located outside the building at the railcar unloading station. The unloading station has stationary drip pans installed to minimize incidental releases. TDI is pumped to the pouring mixing head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a continuous slab of flexible polyurethane foam. The foam is cut into 100 feet slabs and then stacked in the slab room in order to cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nAssessment and modeling was conducted for a worse case release scenario of TDI  from The Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division  The Worst Case Scenario was assumed to be a rupture of a TDI railcar releasing the entire contents (190,000 lbs) into an undiked area (urban topography).  Using weather data for the Lakeland region obtained from www.wunderground.com, the maximum daily temperature recorded for the past three years was 102\u00b0F. The corrected release rate at 102\u00b0 F (the highest temperature for the last three years in the Lakeland) was 2.3lbs/min"

The lookup tables in the Society of Plastic Industry's (SPI) RMP for TDI users which is based on the technique described in EPA's RMP Guidance for OCA was used to identify the end point distance. In particular, equation D-1of the guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation based upon a vapor pressure correlation published by the National Institute of Standards technology (NIST). A Gaussian Plume model was used to determine the endpoint distance based on the evaporation rate. This was found to be 850ft (0.16 miles). Within the area delineated by the endpoint distance there are no residential receptors, however 4 off-site industrial businesses would be impacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario is a leak from an unloading hose connecting the tank car to bulk storage system inside the facility.  An estimated 10 gallons or 100 lbs of TDI is spilled into an undiked area (urban topography) before the flow of product is stopped.  The calculated release rate of an ambient temperature (25 C) using Equation 7-8 from RMP Guidance for OCA is 0.00058 lbs/min.  The corrected release rate at 102\u00b0 F  ( the highest temperature for the last three years in the Lakeland area obtained from www.wunderground.com) using Equation 3-11 is 0.0021 lbs/min.  The estimated duration of release is 47,619 minutes using Equation 3-5.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using the look up tables in SPI's RMP for TDI Users which is based on the technique described in EPA's RMP Guidance for OCA.  In particular, equation D-1 of the guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation based upon a vapor pressure correlation published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The facility conducts emergency response and spill response drills on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter Co., Lakeland Division, operates with an attention to employee awareness and emphas ongoing training of all personnel.  Additionally employees receive Emergency Response Technician Level III Hazwoper training annually.  A TDI unloading checklist has been implemented to ensure equipment is in satisfactory condition prior to use. A mountable drain blocker has been placed next to the tank truck unloading area. The operator must now place this drain blocker above the storm drain next to the truck unloading area prior to each truck unload to prevent possible leakage or spills into the storm drain as a result of leakage from the piping connections.  Continuous improvements are performed as and when technology and processes become available. Carpenter is committed to provide a safe and environmentally responsible working condition for all employees and surrounding community."
