The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n\n\n- Updating the RMP due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing the storage and associated parcel shipments of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) from the facility's D-Tank Farm in existing Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-15-19 above the TDI threshold quantity of 10,000-pounds.  Stolthaven Houston currently stores TDI in two existing Low-Pressure Tanks also located in the facility's D-Tank Farm (Tanks D-15-22 and D-30-10) as represented in previous RMP submittals\n\n\n\n- Updating the five-year accident history to include an unplanned release of TDI that occurred on the evening of August 23, 2013\n\n\n\n- Minor RMP data element updates based on revisions to Stolthaven Houston's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and revisions to our Standard Operating Procedures found in the terminal's Local Training Manual (LTM)\n\n\n\n- Updating the site's Emergency Contact and the contact information for the Terminal Manager responsible for RMP implementation at Stolthaven Houston Inc.  \n\n\n\n- Changing the D-Tank Farm TDI Storage Process and the three Pentane Intermodal Transfer Processes to reflect RMP Program Level 3 coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining "

Tank P-50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case VAM release scenario, was placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.

      "SummaryText": "IVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nDuring the preceding five years there has been one accidental release from a RMP covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal which resulted in significant property damage on-site.  On the evening of August 23, 2013 nitrogen pressure was being used to unload a rail car containing TDI into one of Stolthaven Houston's on-site TDI storage tanks.  As the rail car was being unloaded, the rail switching crew on-duty coupled the terminal's locomotive to a string of rail cars, including the working TDI rail car, and began to pull the cars away from the rail rack.  As the rail car being emptied of TDI was moved, the TDI cargo hose released from the car, and the car's 1-inch valve connected to the plant nitrogen hose was sheared off.  Residual nitrogen pressure in the rail car caused approximately 4,500-gallons of TDI to be released from the sheared 1-inch valve opening on the rail car into the Rail Rack R-2 concrete containment area, with a small amount of TDI released onto an in-plant concrete road adjacent to the rack in the center of the facility.  There was no off-site release of TDI liquid.  A Stolthaven Houston operator on duty at Rail Rack R-2 immediately closed the rail rack TDI product line valve leading to the storage tank, and the TDI liquid release from the rail car stopped once the residual nitrogen pressure in the car reached atmospheric pressure.  A third party environmental response contractor was contacted within an hour of this release to assist with the necessary clean up efforts, which were completed on the late afternoon of August 27, 2013.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this incident, the following corrective actions were implemented by Stolthaven Houston Inc. after review by the terminal's Management Steering Committee:  (1) the TDI incident was discussed in detail at a mandatory meeting conducted at Rail Rack R-2 for all facility Operations, Waste Water, and Maintenance Department personnel, (2) Standard Operating Procedures rela"

Similarly, there have been no accidental releases from any RMP covered processes in the past five years which resulted in known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAll incidents at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal are formally investigated as part of our facility's ISO Quality Management System (QMS) to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the events, and to implement appropriate corrective actions for continuous process improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(e):  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting our employees, the public, the environment, and company assets during potential emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our action plan with the community emergency response plan and the North Channel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Stolthaven Houston Inc. is also an active member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is maintained which provides guidelines for responding to various emergencies such as fires, hazardous material spills, personal injuries, severe weather events, and property damage that may occur at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(f):  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of current initiatives at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal to assist in preventing and/or responding to accidental chemical releases, and to "

      "SummaryText": "help effectively manage the hazards present at the facility:\n\n\n\n- In 2013 Stolthaven Houston hired a third-party consulting firm to perform the three-year RMP compliance audit required pursuant to 40 CFR 68, Sections ?? 68.58 and 68.79.  As a result of this third-party audit, a RMP/PSM Team was formed to address the audit findings.  This team is currently performing a comprehensive review and revision of Stolthaven Houston's RMP/PSM program to better align the program with our current work practices.  As part of this comprehensive internal review, individuals at the facility have been assigned to each of the specific RMP/PSM program elements to promote responsibility and ownership.\n\n\n\n- Stolthaven Houston has also contracted with a safety consulting firm to facilitate the five-year Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  We expect to conduct this PHA revalidation for the facility during the first half of 2014.  \n\n\n\n- As they become available, toxic and/or flammable product storage tanks at the facility are being equipped with ball valves to replace existing gate valves as part of an ongoing safety enhancement and automation project. \n\n\n\n- Continuous improvement through the facility's ISO 9001: 2000 Certified Quality Management System (QMS)\n\n\n\n- Employee Suggestion / Experienced Feedback Program\n\n\n\n- Regular safety meetings with Stolthaven Houston Operations Department employees and contract \n\npersonnel working in the Stolthaven Houston Terminal\n\n\n\nAdditional capital budget projects recently implemented or planned for 2014 to improve safety and emergency response at Stolthaven Houston Inc. include the purchase of 1,000-gallons of fire fighting foam, replacing certain fire water delivery lines in A and B-Tank Farms, adding new fire water connections on the east side of D-Tank Farm and in P-Tank Farm, replacing the terminal's spill response boat, purchasing additional fire-fighting equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE"
