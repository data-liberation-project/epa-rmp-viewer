Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Cherokee County Cogeneration Partners, L.P. facility is an 80 megawatt combined cycle cogeneration facility.  The facility generates electricity which is sold through a power purchase agreement to the host utility.  The qualifying facility is a potable ice manufacturing facility which produces, stores and markets ice to retail customers.\n\nThe ice production process consists of two systems.  (1) Overfeed System - This system uses electric powered compressors to refrigerate ammonia which is then used to produce ice.  This system is maintained and operated by Triangle Ice Company and covered under their RMP.  (2) Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration (AAR) - This system uses steam energy to refrigerate ammonia which then goes through a heat exchanger to remove heat from the ammonia of the Overfeed System.  This AAR System is maintained and operated by Cherokee County Cogeneration Partners and is the primary subject of this RMP.\n\nThe refrigeration systems utilized at the facility contain anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  A specific refrigerant charge is solely contained within the piping, heat exchangers, and equipment that comprise the system.  The systems that monitor and control the refrigeration systems contain state of the art technology that initiates alarms, as well as protective shutdowns, to ensure the safe operation of the system.\n\nThe personnel who manage, operate, and maintain the facility are trained to observe all precautions required to safely handle ammonia at the facility.  This not only minimizes their exposure to a hazardous chemical, it also minimizes the threat to nearby members of the surrounding community.\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hrs a day and the personnel are trained in the use of emergency response equipment to minimize a chemical release at the facility.  Our emergency response and preparedness plan includes procedures for notifying the County Emer"

Stationary Source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to produce, store and market potable quality ice.  The refrigeration system is a closed system that requires periodic makeup on a minimal basis.  Ammonia detentions systems alert personnel of leaks in process areas.  Periodic leak checks are performed to ensure a tight, leak free system is maintained.  The total inventory of ammonia within the AAR system is 14,000 pounds.  Ammonia is not stored at the facility for system makeup requirements.\n\n3.  Worst case and alternative case release scenarios.\nRemoved per change in EPA regulation.\n\n\n4. General accidental release prevention and specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with all state and federal codes and regulations.  The facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The facility is constructed with materials and equipment designed for ammonia refrigeration use in accordance with all applicable codes and standards.\n\n5.  Five year accident history\n\nNone during this time period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response\n\nThe facility emergency response and preparedness plan is coordinated with the Cherokee County Emergency Preparedness Center.  All facility personnel that would respond to accidental releases are trained under the requirements of 29CFR Part 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.  Drills are conducted to simulate spills and practice recovery techniques.  Our Emergency Response an Preparedness plan includes a notification plan to contact required agencies in the event of an accidental release from the facility."
