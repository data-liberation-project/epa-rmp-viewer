St. Helens Facility has been in operation since 1966.  Since the beginning the employees and management have had accident prevention and training programs in place for the safety of the general public and employees of the facility.  These programs include detailed operator training, operating instructions, maintenance procedures, active employee safety committees, safety inspections and emergency procedures.  The Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management system.  This tool has further enhanced our safety program for processes that could pose a hazard to the employees and the public.\n\nIn the event that an accidential release were to occur, Dyno Nobel Inc. has established an Emergency Action Plan in conjunction with the Columbia River Fire and Rescue to insure the effects will be minimized. \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Dyno Nobel Inc. St Helens Facility produces nitrogen-based fertilizers.  Products shipped from the facility are Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia, Urea Prills, Urea-Ammonium Nitrate Solution and Carbon Dioxide.  These products are manufactured from natural gas, air and water.  For RMP planning purposes the whole site is considered the stationary source.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is produced in a continous process on site and stored for sale, converted to Aqua Ammonia, or further processing with Carbon Dioxide to manufacture Urea.  Another portion of the Anhydrous Ammonia is used to manufacture a water solution of Ammonium Nitrate, which is mixed with Urea to form a fertilizer solution.\n\nThe regulated substances handled on site in quantities larger than threshold amounts are Anhydrous Ammonia and 30% Aqua Ammonia.  There are three active 625 ton Anhydrous Ammonia storage spheres on site and a 30% Aqua Ammonia storage tank with the capacity of 85,000 gallons.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDE"

A computer system is used for instrumentation and controls and is protected from power outages with a battery back up.  Vessels are equipped with various temperature, pressure and level alarms.  Remotely operated isolation valves are used.  Critical areas have secondary containment and curbing.  Fire monitors are strategically located around the process.\nThe operations program ensures fully and continously trained operators.  Emergency shutdown systems and procedures are in use.  Prestart-up safety reviews are conducted for new and modified processes and equipment.  Management of change procedures are used.  The process equipment has safe upper and lower limits recorded.  Daily routine equipment and leak checks are carried out.  A work permit system is used for process unit installation and maintenance that covers entry control, lockout/tagout procedure, hot work, line taps and confined space entry.\nIn maintaining our plant integrity, Dyno Nobel Inc. has a fully equipped maintenance department with well-trained and experienced maintenance personnel.  Craft training and testing is used for certification.  A preventative maintenance program is in effect, which includes corrosion/erosion monitoring.  A contractor qualification, selection and safety training procedure is in effect for all outside contractors working on the site.\nIn pulling the facility into a safe working team the safety department is active in total employee involvement of the safety program.  Weekly team safety meetings and monthly plant representative safety meetings are held.  Monthly safety inspection tours of the operating process are held, and monthly plant management safety meetings are held.\nIn addition to the preceding "

A release occurred in November of 2002 where employees at a next door facility were evacuated from their building until the ammonia odor dissipated.\n\nAQUA AMMONIA >20%\nThere have been no releases of aqua ammonia >20% that meet the EPA release criteria definition over the last five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONCE PLAN\n\nDyno Nobel Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan in place basedupon 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Dyno Nobel Inc. coordinates with the local fire department and helps prepare them to respond to emergencies at the facility.  There is an annual familiarization tour conducted through the site for the fire fighters.  Site specific training is also conducted with the firefighters.  In addition, Dyno Nobel Inc. has supplied the fire department with a monitor for determining ammonia concentrations in emergency situations.\nDyno Nobel Inc. is an active participant in Columbia Emergency Planning Association (CEPA) along with other industries and emergency agencies.  Through CEPA, Dyno Nobel Inc. has assisted in community emergency planning and has lead tabletop training exercies involving ammonia emergencies.  Also, through CEPA, Dyno Nobel has taken the lead to set up and support a county wide emergency call system to alert citizens of emergency situations in their areas.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPR"
