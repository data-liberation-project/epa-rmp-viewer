      "SummaryText": "Effingham Equity is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the Wade Township Fire Dept. and the Jasper County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response to any release and minimize the impact of the release on the community and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct applicaiton as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and an alternate case scenario, however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia including the Illinois Department of Agriculture regulations and OSHA 29 CFR- 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last five years.\n\nEffingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR- 1910.38.  Emergency planning and community right to know information is provided to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, and the local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\nImproving safety at Effingham Equity is an On-going process.  Periodic evaluations are perfomed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time."
