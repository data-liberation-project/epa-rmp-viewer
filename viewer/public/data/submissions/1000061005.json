This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nReady Pac - Irwindale Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of their regulated substance.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nReady Pac - Irwindale Facility is located at 4401 Foxdale Ave, Irwindale CA, 91706.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System.

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP/EPA RMP/ CalOSHA PSM Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Ready Pac - Irwindale Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should\n\nalso be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actua"

Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an\n\nammonia release:\n\nWell-designed Relief System\n\nSafety Showers/Eyewash Stations\n\nGas Detection\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Ready Pac - Irwindale Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia. Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to\n\nensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 49,347 lbs. Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 10,000 lbs threshold for EPA RMP and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities and over the 500 lbs state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.
