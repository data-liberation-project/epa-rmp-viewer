We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide\u00bfs Responsible Care\u00ae requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Union Carbide Institute Marshalling Rail Yard is used to temporarily store tank cars for eventual processing at the Institute Plant.  The rail yard is managed by the Institute Plant, but is not considered contiguous with the Institute Plant.  No chemical loading or  unloading takes place at  the Institute Marshalling Yard.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Institute Marshalling Yard, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  \n\n\nUnion Carbide owns and stores a threshold quantity of the following EPA regulated toxic substance in the Institute Marshalling Yard:\t\n\n\u00b7 Ethylene Oxide\n\nUnion Carbide owns and stores threshold quantities of the following EPA regulated flammable substances in the Institute Marshalling Yard:\n\n\u00b7 1,3-butadiene  \t\n\u00b7 Isopentane\t\n\n\n\n\n\n3\tKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA\u00bfs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating"

According to EPA\u00bfs Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. \nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring include:\n\u00b7 Pressure Relief Device:  This device is designed to relieve pressure at a pre-determined set point and prevents over pressure of the railroad tank car.\n\u00b7 Cameras:  These cameras can be used by security to detect leaks.\n\u00b7 Surveillance:  Yard clerks, RESCAR employees and security routinely monitor the rail yard.\n\u00b7 Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress ethylene oxide vapors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\nThis scenario assumes a safety relief valve fails and prematurely opens on a railroad tank car, releasing ethylene oxide at a rate of 517 lbs. per minute for 30 minutes as a gas to the atmosphere, leading to a toxic release.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nThe following active mitigation measure was used in this scenario: \n\u00b7 Surveillance: Yard clerks, RESCAR employees and security routinely monitor the rail yard.\nThis scenario assumes a yard clerk detects a release and notifies the Union Carbide Hazardous Leaks Prevention Team to cap-off the leaking safety relief valve in 30 minutes.\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring include:\n\u00b7 Cameras:  These cameras can be used by security to detect leaks.\n\u00b7 Fire Water Spray Monitors:  Area fire water"
