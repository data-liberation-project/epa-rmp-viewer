The most recent PHA/update was performed on October 13, 2009.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dow-GBO maintains written standard operating procedures (SOPs).  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n \nTraining\n\nDow-GBO has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDow-GBO carries out and duly documents periodic maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are provided specialized training as needed. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow-GBO to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed on October 22, 2008.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions and/or operating practices are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews re"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nDow-GBO conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on June 20, 2011.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nDow-GBO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nDow-GBO truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00c2\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, we are coordinated with the Assumption Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDow-GBO's primary activity includes the solution mining of salt from the Napoleonville Dome, which is located in Assumption Parish and underlies a surface area of approximately 1670 acres.  Dow's operations on the Napoleonville Salt Dome began in 1957 with the drilling and mining of the Grace No. 1 well.  Since then, an additional 29 Dow operated caverns have been mined into the dome.  Fifteen of the active caverns are in hydrocarbon service with total storage capacity in excess of 38 million barrels.  Nine caverns are in mining service with a saturated brine deliverability of 8500 gallons per minute.  In this resubmission 2 regulated substances, methane and pentane, were removed since these materials are no longer present.  We have 6 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances (and their maximum inventory, in pounds) include Ethane (183,000,000), Butane (100,000,000), Propylene  [1-Propene] (75,000,000), Ethylene [Ethene] (116,000,000), Propane (252,000,000) and Chlorine (8,000). \n\n\n \n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario"

The WCS scenario for the chemical pentane was removed from this submittal.  The WCS scenario for propylene included in the original 1991 submittal is still valid. A WCS for butane was added to replace the pentane scenario. The WCS and ARS estimated residential population within the distance to endpoints were updated in this submittal. \n\nIn accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18832, April 9, 2004), it is no longer required to include a discussion of the WCS and ARS in the RMPs Executive Summary.  However,  their results are included in the body of the submittal.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Dow-GBO facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow-GBO maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some of this documentation includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment spec sheets, and reactive chemicals tests.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the Dow Fire and Explosion Index, the Dow Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a r"

      "SummaryText": "ny of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\n\nDow-GBO has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there have been no reportable accidental release of regulated substances, as defined by the RMP rule, during this period.\n\n \n6.Emergency Response Plan\n\nDow-GBO has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nAssumption Parish OEP is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no planned changes at this time as a result of our implementing the accidental release prevention program."
