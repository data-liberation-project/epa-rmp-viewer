(\"220 Laboratories\") to prevent accidental releases of dimethyl ether, isobutane, isopentane, n-butane, and 1,1-difluoroethane that could cause harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures.  The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at 220 Laboratories to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency preparedness procedures including spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms, and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by 220 Laboratories and are summarized in this Plan, the Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual, and Hazardous Materials Business Emergency Plan.  \n\n\n\nThis Plan, the Hazardous Materials Business Emergency Plan, and Process Safety Management Manual document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at 220 Laboratories.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n220 Laboratories is located at 2375 Third Street in Riverside, California (the \"facility\").  The facility is situated within a commercial and industrial area and occupies approximately ten acres of land.  The facility utilizes propellants to manufacture health and beauty aids.  Propellants are stored in six aboveground propellant storage tanks at the facility.  The propellant storage area is equipped with truck racks to unload propellant from tanker trucks into the propellant storage tanks.  Propellants are directed to the aerosol product manufacturing lines via piping.  220 Laboratories is subject to OSHA PSM for dimethyl ether, isobutane, isopentane, n-butane, and 1,1-difluoroethane; ther"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of dimethyl ether, isobutane, isopentane, n-butane, and 1,1-difluoroethane that could cause harm to employees, the public, and the environment.  The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\n220 Laboratories has safely operated in the City of Riverside since 1991.  Key elements of the facility's safety program include written environmental health and safety procedures, employee training, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving dimethyl ether, isobutane, isopentane, n-butane, and 1,1-difluoroethane in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response activities with City of Riverside Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of regulated substances.  In compliance with California Office of Emergency Services CalARP program regulation 2765.1, the facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.
