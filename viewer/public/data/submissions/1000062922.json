ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\n\n\n  At this George's facility, we utilize \"Anhydrous Ammonia\" that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuble as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  George's strives to protect all its valuble resources and assets-both personnel and property.  We have families and friends in this community and are invested in safety for everyone.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.    \n\nIt is our policy to comply with all Federal, State and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with area fire departments and the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of chickens for use as refrigerated or frozen food.  We utilize Anhydrous Ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.      An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks with ammonia.  Access to the site is restriced to facility workers, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 50,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n3.

It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two-phase flow; liquid leak followed by the remaining aerosol or gas. The leaks duration under worst circumstances would last 1 minute. Estimated maximum endpoint is 4.3 miles.  [ALOHA(R)] 5.4.7 \n\n\n\nAlternate Case Scenario (Ammonia)\n\nThe alternate case scenario would be failure of the high pressure receiver when full. This unit averages 15-25% during normal operations; although it is not frequent, it is possible for the receiver to become full during specific times and operation. The maximum quantity storable in this receiver is 17,756 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two-phase flow; liquid leak followed by the remaining aerosol or gas. The leaks duration under worst circumstances would last 1 minute. Estimated maximum endpoint is 4.2 miles.  [ALOHA(R)] 5.4.7 \n\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nTo date, this facilities last reportable release was on 02/18/2017. The maximum calculated release was 300 pounds. The duration of this release was approximately 30 minutes. \n\n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by the Complex Saftey Manager and PSM Coordinator.  He/She will administrate in conjunction with George's management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning District and area fire departments.\n\n\n\n6.

Our Refrigeration technicians, Maintenance technicians and Waste Water technicians receive a combination of classroom and On-the-job-training.  They are given written tests and are observed so to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.  The same standard applies to our wastewater technicians that handle the chlorine.  They are trained yearly and are tested and evaluated on the job.\n\n\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n\n\nGeorge's Inc., has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions.  We have quarterly meetings as well as annual certification.  This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release.  \n\nWe work closely with the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning District and area fire departments on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns."
