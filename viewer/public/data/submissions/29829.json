In the event\nthat an accidental release should accur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s),\nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the\nspecific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nWe are engaged in agricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous\nAmmonia.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is\n#493130 farm product warehousing and storage.  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product \nsubject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane\nfor both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We\ninclude Propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training and\nmaintenance programs, however only facilities used for Anhydrous Ammonia are included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammmonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the\nearly spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with\nlittle if any product transfer taking place.  The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage\nvessels at the location is 130,000 lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 18,000 gallons storing\n78,000 lbs.  The maximum quantity"
