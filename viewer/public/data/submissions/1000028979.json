Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company staff and management are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment includes a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Barton County Emergency Preparedness and the Great Bend Fire Department which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n\n\nB. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Fuller Brush facility's primary activities encompass production of brooms, mops, brushes, and cleaners. There are 2 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are Isobutane (Propane, 2-methyl) and Propane. They are both used in the production of aerosols.  We discontinued the use of Formaldehyde at our facility in August 2011.\n\n\n\nC. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CCFR part 68 EPA regulations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the Fuller Brush facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the aerosol filling process.  It is accessible to all employees on the company computer network.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n"

The methodologies used to carry out these analyses are What If/Checklist, and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated as needed. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company maintains written operating procedures to safely conduct activities within our covered processes. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes in a written manual and the company computer network.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the aerosol line process are competent in the operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified maintenance personnel carry out the maintenance operations. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at The Fuller Brush Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing new or modified equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company Conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company will promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.  The Fuller Brush Company has not ever had a catastrophic release to date.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Fuller Brush Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning procedures, accident prevention, and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, The Fuller Brush Company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
