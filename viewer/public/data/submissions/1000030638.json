Quapaw Facility specialists solve problems for the demanding nuclear, semiconductor and hazardous materials industries. With the largest boron isotope enrichment facility in the world, Ceradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility continues to be the leading manufacturer of enriched boron.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nCeradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility is committed to the protection of the safety, health and environment of all individuals affected by our business activities, including employees, visitors, contractors, customers and the communities in which we operate.  The safety and health of employees is our primary concern and first priority. All injuries, occupational illnesses, and environmental incidents can be prevented, and an incident-free environment is achievable. This commitment is outlined in Boron's EHS Policy.\n\n\n\nCeradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility and RMP Regulated Substances \n\nCeradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility purchases and utilizes boron trifluoride (BF3) as a raw material feedstock into its boron isotopic separation process.   Boron trifluoride is delivered to the site as a compressed gas in tube trailers consisting of 6 individual tubes, containing 3500 pounds of BF3 gas at a pressure of 1800 psig.  The BF3 gas is transferred from a single tube of the tube trailer into the production area; tubes are used sequentially.  Ceradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility sells isotopically enriched boron trifluoride into global semiconductor markets. Final product gas is stored and transported in portable compressed gas cylinders packaged in accordance with USDOT Hazardous Materials regulations. \n\nCeradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility maximum BF3 inventory storage, consisting of one to two tube trailers, BF3 contained in-process equipment, and final product BF3 inventory for sale, does not exceed 50,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Prog"
