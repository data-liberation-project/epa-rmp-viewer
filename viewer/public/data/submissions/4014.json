These inspections are performed not only by the local safety committee, but also  by the local Fire Department Hazard and Emergency section and the City's insurance carriers and underwriters.\n    The Water Filtration Plant purification processes are a coordination of individual processes, that takes water from a rust, hard limestone water source and produces a rust free, reduced hardness and safe drinking water for the City of Bluffton.\n    These water purification (cleaning) processes are primarily:  aeration for removal of the entrained gases, such as hydrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide; coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation (clarification) for the reduction of iron, manganese and mineral hardness; filtration for the finishing (polishing); disinfection for the final purification against any possible pathogenic bacteria.    The disinfection process requires a ready available supply of chlorine.  This supply is restricted to one ton containers.  The amount of chlorine in use and in storage is usually one and one-half tons, with the maximum of two tons.\n    The worst case release and alternative release modeling scenarios were based on EPA'S RMP* COMP Model.  The EPA models indicate there could be releases with off-site impact.  The preliminary exami"

The enclosed chlorine cylinder storage is a planned passive mitigation feature to contain chlorine releases.  The chlorine supply lines from the chlorine cylinders to the chlorination equipment are operated under vacuum conditions with the chlorine supply regulator directly attached to the chlorine cylinder valve.  The supply regulator will not allow chlorine to leave the cylinder unless there is a vacuum in the supply line from the chlorine cylinder to the chlorination equipment.   As a result there are no chlorine pressure supply lines or manifolds.  Under the above conditions, a release in unlikely.\n    Accidental release prevention in regards to chlorine, the Water Filtration Plant operates under the OSHA RMP rules for analyzing possible risks, formulation and reviewing prevention and training programs. \n    The practice of reviewing the Plan's prevention programs in the light of developing technologies in materials, equipment, safety products and management, identify areas of possible improvements in operation processes, equipment maintenance and employee training.\n    There have been no accidental releases of chlorine at the Bluffton Water Filtration Plant during the past five years.\n    The Water Filtration Plant's chlorine emergency response involves the active coordination of the individual emergency plans of the Wells County Emergency Plan Committee, City of Bluffton Fire Department HAZMAT team and the Bluffton Water Department's Emergency contingency Plan, which includes the training and drilling for the responders, both individually and collectively.\n    The public notification and alerts for all emergency responses are organized to be performed in accordance with the criteria set up in the Wells County Emergency Committee Plan and are subject "
