The facility uses administrative controls, such as operating procedures, operator inspection rounds, maintenance procedures, employee training, experienced personnel, and reliable vendors; sensors and alarms for high and low pressures, and the presence of chlorine; and design safeguards such as relief devices, excess flow valves, check valves, and pressure regulators.  The prevention program contains the elements required for Program 2 processes, including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.",

We fall into the Program 2 Prevention Program.\n\n  We have liquid chlorine in quantities above the threshold quantity as specified in Section 68.115 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore must comply with the RMP program.  This program provides our facility with an integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazard posed by regulated substances.  Under this program, our facility has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.  Because we are committed to the success of our written risk management program, we encourage all suggestions.  We strive for a comprehensive, integrated prevention system, which obtains clear understanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of our facility, as well as the general public.\n\n  The plant is capable of treating 2.5 million gallons of water per day.  Chemicals used to treat the water are stored at the plant.  Liquid chlorine is stored in racks in the chlorine storage room in 1-ton cylinders.\n\n    Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n  The Water Department used RMP*Comp to determine the affected area of our worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  For our worst-case scenario, we used the parameters specified in the regulation.  RMP*Comp determined that our area of impact, if releasing one ton of liquid chlorine under these parameters, would include offsite public receptors.  Although we left the area as a circle in our risk management plan, we believe that an actual release will not follow a perfect cir"

      "SummaryText": "cle.  The water treatment plant sits below the river bluff.  Since chlorine gas is heavier than air, it is likely that the chlorine would travel along the river.\n\n  For our alternative release, we selected a scenario that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  We prepared a model based on a 60-minute release from a 5/16 inch valve failure.  This release would also affect offiste public receptors.\n\n  Landview was used to estimate the population residing within our scenario impact areas.\n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n\n  We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.  In addition, the plant has had no significant chlorine releases in its history.\n\n    Emergency Response Plan\n\n  In the event of a chlorine release, we contact the Pike County LEPC.  Plant operators are trained in emergency escape procedures.  The Louisiana Fire Department has toured the facility and will respond to a chlorine release.  Water department staff will be available to assist as needed.  The Pike County LEPC will notify the public as appropriate.\n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n  Water Department staff plans to train with the Louisiana Fire Department on self-contained breathing apparatus and the chlorine repair kits so the staff can respond to future chlorine releases."
