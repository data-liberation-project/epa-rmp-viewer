The facility maintains approximately 13,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice making and cold storage.  Reddy Ice-Nashville is a state-of-the-art ice manufacturing facility, originally constructed in 1985, enlarged in 1994 and again in 2000. \n\nThe facility refrigeration system is a standard closed loop design consisting of compressors, condensers, storage tanks, ice makers, and freezer vaults.  The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high and low temperature and pressure, low oil pressure, high and low liquid level cutouts, and pressure relief valves on all equipment that vent into a 20,000 gallon deluge tank located outside the facility.  Ammonia detectors and alarms are installed throughout the plant.  The compressors are normally run and shut down through the computer via Allen-Bradley PLC controls.\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to replenish the ammonia in the system as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant.  The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent.  Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility?s program of proper employee training, knowledge of the equipment and procedures, and the development, maintenance and implementation of effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment..\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Nashville facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant ammonia refrigeration system for the protection of its employees, the general public and the environment. The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are"

The Accident Prevention Program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility.  Reddy Ice Corporate Management and Reddy Ice-Nashville management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of EPA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act.  The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation and integration of the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implemen"

The Plant Manager has been identified as PSM/RM Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements.  The Plant Engineer has responsibility for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation.  An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Nashville facility has conducted offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) relative to the potential accidental release of ammonia.  The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release.  A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Nashville facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Nashville facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying the public and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Davidson County LEPC and the Nashville Metro Fire Department and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed.

No significant changes are planned to the facility or operations. Reddy Ice facilities operate an ongoing program of preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice is continuing to implement ammonia diffusion/neutralization system installation at all plants and supporting the installation of additional ammonia detection, alarm, ventilation, and safety systems at its larger facilities."
