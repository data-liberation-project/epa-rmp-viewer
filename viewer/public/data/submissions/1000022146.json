This RMP is being resubmitted to reflect LWC's committment to safety.  Chlorine was eliminated from the Crescent Hill Water Treatment Plant's chemical inventory early in 2011.  Engineering practices have been observed in the design and operation of systems such that the probability of accidental release is minimal.  Practices include, but are not limited to the installation of sensitive detection units.  These detectors provide continuous remote indication of concentration to a control room that is staffed around the clock.  LWC personnel have quick access to personal protective equipment to assist with safe egress and aninitial investigation.  Appropriate equipment is also readily available for more thorough investigation and isolation in a contaminated atmosphere.\n\n\n\nIn capital improvement projects within the production system, safety-related items are reviewed by a team of individuals who are knowledgeable in the covered process.  Once identified, resolution of a safety issue is written into contract.\n\n\n\nLWC's emergency response plan is integrated into operations at each facility.  The plan was developed in conjunction with public emergency response authorities, in compliance with local, state, and federal laws, and has been tested to respond effectively in the event of a hazardous chemical leak.  LWC personnel are trained as emergency responders at the Technician level and have drilled with Louisville Fire Department Hazardous Response Units.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Crescent Hill Water Treatment Plant is located at 3018 Frankfort Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40206.  The chemical regulated by the Clean Air Act at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nLWC has installed miti"

Active mitigation devices include leak detectors that provide chemical concentration information to plant operators.  Administrative controls include adherence to requirements of LWC's Process Safety Management Program. \n\n\n\nEstablished standard operating procedures facilitate consistency and aid in the prevention of incidents.  The Process Safety Management Program is reviewed and updated to reflect changes in safety processes and includes process hazards analysis, management of change procedures, operating procedures, safe work practices, training requirements and guidelines, mechanical integrity procedures (including maintenance checklists and daily equipment checks), pre-startup review procedures, emergency response procedures, incident investigation guidelines, and audit guidelines.  \n\n\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases involving ammonia or chlorine that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damages within the previous five years of operation of the Louisville Water Company.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN \n\n\n\nLWC's emergency response plan is integrated into operations at each facility.  The plan specifically details LWC's emergency response plan in compliance with S.A.R.A. Title III Emergency Response and Community Right to Know Act of 1986.  The plan was coordinated with the Kentucky Emergency Response Commission and the Louisville-Jefferson County, Kentucky Local Emergency Planning Committee.  In general the plan includes:\n\n\n\n1. Steps for the prevention of hazardous material spills - includes ongoing surveys of hazardous material storage and handling and employee training.\n\n2. Preparation for a spill - includes organization charts for handling the spill and site specific training for containment of the spill.\n\n3. Spill Control Plan - includes steps for notifying pe"

Employees are trained to recognize when and how processes can be improved.  Operating under the guidelines of Process Safety Management, the management of change element provides a mechanism for constant internal review and improvement in production quality and safety.  Additionally, Process Safety Management requires five-year reviews on aspects of the program.  Avenues for improvements in safety are identified during these reviews."
