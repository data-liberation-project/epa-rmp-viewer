One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS # 26471-62-5.\n\n\n\nAs stated in our initial RMP registration, a concrete containment area for the TDI railcar unloading was constructed in September 2001. With such a containment system, including a design capacity of over 24,000-gals, this facility currently meets the Program 1 eligibility requirements. \n\n\n\nTwo commercial blends of TDI are currently used at the facility.  These blends have isomer ratios of TDI 2-4 (CAS # 584-84-9) and TDI 2-6 (CAS # 91-08-7) approximately 80/20 and 65/35  respectively.  Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI 80/20 railcar into the subsurface railcar containment area.  The impact of this spill was reevaluated (on 4/16/14) using the ALOHA model and resulted in the area of concern with no public receptors being affected, which classifies the polyether PU foam manufacturing process at this facility as a Program Level 1.  The release rate, calculated by the ALOHA model (version 5.4.4), was 0.0291 lbs./min.  Two alternate scenarios, including the rupture and spillage of TDI 80/20 from the largest storage tanks (a"

The release rates for the alternate scenarios, calculated by the ALOHA model, were from 0.0101 to 0.0177 lbs./min.\n\n\n\nThis facility has it's own HAZWOPER-trained \"HAZMAT\" Team, which will provide the initial emergency response to on-site hazardous chemical spill events.  This facility has also arranged for emergency response assistance through a qualified contractor.  The facility's Hazmat Team Incident Commander will request (as necessary) the assistance of the Los Angeles County fire department HAZMAT team to respond to emergency chemical spill events.  This facility's Emergency Response Plan, prepared in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q) has been coordinated with the local fire department and the local fire department HAZMAT commander.  All HSM employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures, as required by local, state and federal regulations.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.42, there have been no accidental releases of TDI at this facility within the last five years.\n\n\n\n"
