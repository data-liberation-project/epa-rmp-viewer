Accidental release prevention and emergency response at the Stationary source.\nThe plant site has an Emergency Response and Prevention plan which incorporates initial response, 24 hour surveillance camera on the tank, strategic locations of foam cannons, preset limits on volume and temperature on the plant computer system, and HazMat training of select employees on the plant site.\nb. Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nSource: Stationary tank in the tankfarm containing Trichlorosilane - vessel size - 896,000 pounds.\nc. Worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n1) Worst Case release scenario: Tank rupture of Trichlorosilane involving the release of the entire contents in 10 minutes.\n? Administrative controls and mitigation measures include:\n? PSM controls\n? Surveillance camera on the tank\n? Foam cannons located around the tankfarm\n? Dike walls\n? Inspections of the tank and tankfarm\n2) Alternate release scenario: Tank leak of Trichlorosilane which results in a pool fire.\n? Administrative controls and mitigation measures include:\n? PSM controls\n? Surveillance camera on the tank\n? Foam cannons located around the tankfarm\n? Dike walls\n? Inspections of the tank and tankfarm.\nd. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n? PSM controls\n? Training\n? Preventive maintenance\ne. Five year accident history.\n? No incidents\nf. Emergency response program.\n? Emergency response program in place.\n? HazMat Training for Spill Response Team.\n? Agreement with Mobile Fire Department on response.\ng. Planned changes to improve safety.\n? Continue PSM implemetation\n? Continue HazMat training\n? Management of change '\n?HAZOP"
