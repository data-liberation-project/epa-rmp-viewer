The reason for submitting this RMP is to report the change of ownership from Gold Kist Inc to Pilgrim?s Pride Corporation and to update the hazardous scenarios from Urban to Rural Topographies.   We are taking this opportunity to resubmit the entire RMP to be in compliance with the five year mandatory update due next year.  This facility has one refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in this system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Sanford Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite cons"

We do have several passive and active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.  We also incorporate several management systems to decrease the likelihood of this incident occurring.\n\nPilgrims Pride Corporation?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n? Hands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration partners\n? Preventative maintenance program\n? Operating procedures, written with the participation of the refrigeration partners\n? Performance of a process hazard analysis of the entire system including equipment and piping\n? Design and implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n? Procedure for handling all changes to the system\n? Pre-Startup review procedures for significant system modifications\n? Up-to-date process safety information\n? Procedures for investigating release incidents or near-misses\n? Hot-work permits for work on or near the ammonia process.\n? Line Break procedures\n\nThis program was developed with the participation of Pilgrim?s Pride Corporation refrigeration partners.  They were also instrumental in developing the Process Safety Information.  Anhydrous ammonia pipes and valves are labeled and equipment information has been compiled.  The Company follows the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines for safe operations and preventative maintenance of the refrigeration equipment.  In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the regulations.  Chemical-specific exposure prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and air purifying respirators for the refrigeration partners, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammo"
