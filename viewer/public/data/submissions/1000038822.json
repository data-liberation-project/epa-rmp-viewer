The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 4.7 miles.  This scenario incurs significant offsite impact.  The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia is a 2 pipe break, resulting in the release of 11,850 pounds over a ten minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia is estimated to be 1.13 miles.  The effect of the alternative toxic release is limited by the operation of excess flow valves and emergency shutdown procedures in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis - Flammable\r\nThe Port Neal Complex Flammable Worst Case Scenario involves the release and instantaneous explosion of 33,854 pounds of Syn Gas, 10,739 pounds of which are flammable components (hydrogen, methane, and ethane).  The distance to the flammable endpoint for Syn Gas (1 psi overpressure) is estimated to be 0.2 miles.  This scenario incurs minor offsite impact in terms of affected receptors.  The Alternative Release Scenario for Syn Gas is a failure of a flange or bleed valve in the synthesis loop, resulting in the release of 6,577 pounds of flammable components over a ten minute period.  The distance to the 1 psi overpressure flammable endpoint for Syn Gas is estimated to be 0.2 miles.  The effect of the alternative flammable release is limited by operator-controlled isolation valves in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Port Neal Complex has a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standard for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals found at 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Key elements of the PSM program include: 1) stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substant"

Liquid ammonia, estimated at less than 1 pound, was released.  An employee experienced an eye burn.  Treatment included prescription eye drops.  There was no off-site impact or outside response.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Port Neal Complex also has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 50-plus member emergency response team, and an emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the First Call  Network telephone system.  Plant personnel have participated in county-wide emergency drills with local responders including Woodbury County Disaster Services (LEPC), Salix Fire and Rescue, Sioux City Fire Department and Sioux City HazMat.  Additionally the plant exercises its emergency response plan with in-plant drills."

Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include nitric acid, urea solution, and ammonium nitrate solution.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, that exceed the threshold quantity are ammonia and Syn Gas.  \r\n\r\nIt is CF Industries' policy to prevent accidental releases from the plant by effective process safety management (PSM) programs and procedures that include participation by plant employees in every element of the PSM program; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their jobs safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practice and accepted industry standards;   investigating incidents when they do occur so that we can promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience; and auditing the PSM Program on a regular basis to verify that elements, procedures and systems are in place and adequate.  Through our ongoing execution of the PSM/RMP program elements, CF Industries looks continuously for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan and a well-trained and equipped onsite emergency response team; a system to notify neighbors in the event of a release; and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exer"
