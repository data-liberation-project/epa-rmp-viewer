      "SummaryText": "The Mesquite Plant(\"the Facility\") utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas liquids (NGL), where NGL is received via the Chevron NGL pipeline.  Ethane is removed from the NGL and returned directly back into the Chevron NGL pipeline.  The remaining processed NGL is a mix of propane, butanes, pentanes and methane, which is stored in pressurized vessels prior to being shipped in rail cars to the EnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink) Eunice Natural Gas Extraction Plant for processing.  This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Mesquite Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Mesquite Plant is subject to Prevention Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nThe Mesquite Plant was an RMP-regulated facility in the past, but has been de-registered from the RMP program since 2010.  EnLink recently purchased the Facility, and is not aware of any RMP-reportable releases occurring within the past 5 years of Facility operation.  \n\n\n\nThe Mesquite Plant employs six (6) full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \n\n\n\nEnLink, formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in March 2012 for the Mesquite Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture. The regulated flammable chemicals contained in the NGL mixture include methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, N-butane, isopentane, and N-pentane. The NGL received from the Chevron NGL pipeline is stripped of ethane, which is returned directly to the pipeline.  The NGL mixture stored at the Mesquite Plant contains the following RMP-regulated flammables:  n-butane, isobutane, isopentane, pentane, methane and propane.  \n\n\n\nThe Mesquite Plant stores a maximum of 280,888 gallons (1,123,603 lbs) of NGL.  The largest NGL storage vessel has a 40,000-gallon (160,007 lbs) capacity.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Mesquite Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the Prevention Program required under OSHA's PSM. The Mesquite Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation, \n\n?    Process Safety Information, \n\n?    Process Hazard Anal"

The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Public and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\n?    Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\n?    Emergency response measures; \n\n?    Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \n\n?    Employee training; and \n\n?    Program review procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Mesquite Plant maintains written Emergency Shutdown and Startup Procedures (ESSP) that provide guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the ESSP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response with the Midland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Midland County Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of NGL release.  For these reasons, the Mesquite Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \n\n\n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list o"

The most recent Process Hazard Analysis for the Facility was completed on November 8, 2011, at which time several safety improvements were recommended including further evaluating the need for level alarms, excess flow valves, facility lighting, and other safety measures.  Once these recommendations are accepted, the PHA team will put in place an appropriate plan to track and complete the findings. \n\n"
