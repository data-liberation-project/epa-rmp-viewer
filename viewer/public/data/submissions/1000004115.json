The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1954 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to it's current size through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. \n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia. Our commitment to the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP) provides our company with an integrated health, safety,security, environmental and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities. Our dedication to the proper distribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first responders and other industry personnel to enhance the protection of our employees and community neighbors. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc.

      "SummaryText": "is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia. We are not a manufacturer. The material is transported to our facility by tank truck and then transferred  to our on-site storage vessels. From the storage vessels the material can be repackaged for bulk or non-bulk distribution to end-users.\n\nAt this facility, blending of a product we call \"aqua ammonia\" is also performed. This material, ammonium hydroxide,  is a solution of ammonia and water. In order to avoid minor releases of anhydrous ammonia vapor, our handling processes institute closed loop systems that capture the ammonia gas in water. This solution is transferred into a process vessel where the volume is increased and the ammonia concentration standardized for distribution into the commercial market. This product, even at low concentrations, is still a hazardous material due to the ammonia that vaporizes off of it.\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an \"ozone safe\" refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammo"

These  characteristics provide us with an early warning of the material's presence and force us to retreat from ammonia contaminated atmospheres.  High concentrations could have more serious health effects. These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Material Safety Data Sheets, wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training programs as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nSafety Improvement Process:\n\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.  Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance. Each facility has an individual safety committee comprised of site employees and management. These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well as at our customer facilities. The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee. The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management, compliance personnel, headquarters employees, and field personnel that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, provide recommendations and implementation guidance.  Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department. As a whole, these systems provide Tanner Industries, Inc. with a continuous process for the identification of safety improvement opportunities thus reduc"

In December 2002, David Binder, Director of Quality, Safety, & Regulatory Affairs at Tanner was presented EPA Region III's Partnership Award in recognition of significant efforts towards emergency preparedness, prevention, and response programs.\n\nIn 2009, Tanner Industries, Inc. was presented the Private Industry Award by the Philadelphia Fire DepartmentA?s Hazardous Materials Task Force.   This was the first time such an award has been issued by the Hazmat Task Force.   Tanner was nominated and received the award for its outstanding support, which has included training programs and training materials, in assisting with the development and excellence of the hazmat unit. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. uses a variety of safety equipment and specialized procedures to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. In support of our policy, the following is a typical list of safety equipment and systems employed at this facility. \n\n   a) Pressure relief valves are employed on all storage, transfer and delivery equipment to handle unexpected increases in pressure. Per their operational design, these valves will reset after relieving only the excess pressure. Depending on their situational placement in the process, these valves may be designed to relieve pressures caused from either vapor or liquid.\n\n   b) Excess flow shut off devices are incorporated through out the process as prescribed by federal regulation. These valves are designed to stop the flow of liquid material any time their rated flow capacity is exceeded. These valves are designed to prevent the catastrophic release attributed to a storage tank line or valve break.\n\n    c) Breakaway valves are installed at the unloading platforms.  These "
