There is no mitigation in use with the Worst Case Scenario.   \r\n\r\n\r\nSmithfield's accidental release prevention programs are based on safe work practices as referenced by the OSHA, EPA and American National Safety Standards (ANSI), and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) 2-1992 Key element of this prevention program are comprise of:\r\n\tEquipment Design\r\n\tInstallation and Operation of Ammonia Process Systems (ANSI/IIAR 2)\r\n\tEmergency Response and Action Plan Program (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.38 and EPA 40 \t\t\tCFR Parts 68)\r\n\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\tEmergency shut down procedures\r\n\tInspection program (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119)\r\n\t\r\nSmithfield has experienced a accidental release over the past 5 (five) years, which was brought to the attention of the investigation team in March 2010, but occured in Sept 2007.  The Accident was not reported at that time.   \r\n\r\nThe facility emergency response program is based on OSHA's Regulation for Emergency Action Plans (1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).
