This facility is a quarry process plant. We process calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate for use as soil amendments for sale to the public. We use propane as fuel for some of our equipment. The system consists of one 15,000 gallon propane tank which fuels our tractor loader and other equipment as needed.\nWORST CASE SCENARIO. Our worst case scenario is failure of the 15,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88%@60 deg F) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to endpoint is 0.3 miles. There is one private home within that distance with a total population of 2 people. There is another private home just outside the boundary.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC STEPS.
