Achievement of these goals is recognized and rewarded, while failure to attain them is regarded as unacceptable performance.\n\nThe emergency response policy is to respond immediately to any accidental releases or process safety incidents to minimize impact on the employees, public and the environment.  The emergency response teams provide coverage 24 hours a day.  These employees are trained on how to handle emergency situations. \n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented at this site, including:\n\n- A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n- An overview of the emergency response program;\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment; and\n- The certification required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nDPE Pontchartrain Site operates on approximately 1,138 acres in Sections 90, 91, 92 and 93 of Township 115, Range 7 East in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, on property owned by DuPont.  Approximately 200 acres are used for actual manufacturing activities.  The site is located one mile west of LaPlace at 560 Highway 44 at approximately River Mile 136 on the Mississippi River.\n\nAt this site, DPE manufactures neoprene a synthetic rubber that has been produced for nearly 78 years; ch"

Some of neoprene's end uses are: adhesives and sealant, power transmission belts and hoses for automobiles, and wire and cable jacketing.\n\nThis site uses the following chemicals listed under the RMP regulation: \n\nToxics\n\n- Chlorine\n- Nitrogen Tetroxide (Louisiana's list)\n\nFlammables\n\n- 1,3-Butadiene\n- Pentane\n\nThe production areas covered at this site were divided in to four processes per guidance given by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality during their March 2004 RMP inspection.  The first process is the portion of the neoprene process which uses nitrogen tetroxide to manufacture DIBN (diisobutylene nitrosate) an inhibitor in the manufacture of neoprene.   The process hazard analysis (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 08-312.  This PHA covers the portion of the neoprene process where nitrogen tetroxide is used.\n\nThe second process is the chloroprene process, which uses chlorine, pentane and 1,3-butadiene as raw materials.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 08-311.  This is the most recent PHA completed for the portion of the process where these three chemicals are used (the DCB Synthesis and DCB Refining portion of the process.)\n\nThe third process is the chlorine storage facilities.  Chlorine is used as one of the raw materials in the production of chloroprene.  It is received in tank cars and stored in five refrigerated bullets.   The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 08-310.\n\nThe fourth process is the butadiene railcar unloading facilities.  Butadiene is a raw material used in the manufacture of chloroprene.  Butadiene is received in railcars and unloaded into a storage sphere, from the sphere is fed into the process.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section"

The Process Safety Management (PSM) program follows OSHA's Guidelines and is directed toward preventing serious, process-related incidents which might affect plant personnel, off-site communities, the environment, or result in significant property loss or loss of business.  It involves the application of systems and controls to chemical and manufacturing processes in a way that hazards are identified, understood and controlled so that process-related injuries and incidents are prevented.  The process safety management systems include the following items:\n\n- A thorough understanding of the process technology, including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of construction for equipment;\n- Proper design and installation of equipment;\n- Systematic process hazard reviews to identify and address process hazards;\n- Written operating and maintenance procedures;\n- Extensive training for all persons who operate or maintain chemical process equipment;\n- Mechanical integrity testing and preventive maintenance for early detection of potential equipment problems;\n- Mechanical quality assurance programs to ensure that the correct spare parts are installed whenever maintenance is performed;\n- Procedures to identify and manage both obvious and subtle changes in technology, equipment, and personnel, that could have an effect on the site's safety and environmental performance;\n- Pre-startup safety reviews for newly installed or modified equipment;\n- Compliance audits to ensure that process safety management principles, procedures, and regulations are effective and properly implemented;\n- Investigation of actual and potential incidents to identify and implement corrective actions;\n- Participation of all employees in the process safety managemen"

The maximum storage of chlorine tank cars and butadiene is used only rarely and for short periods because of differences between shipments and/or to accommodate supplier's production schedule.\n \nIn addition to the practices described above, processes are designed to include multiple layers of safeguards.  Examples of these include:\n\n- Automatic valves for rail cars, which isolate the supply of materials from the rail car in the event of a process upset; \n- Computer display and control of process parameters;\n- Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\n- Low concentration chlorine detectors that sound an alarm and provide an alarm signal to the computerized process control system when a leak is detected;\n- Emergency scrubber system to prevent emissions from reaching the environment; \n- Isolation valves which can be operated remotely from the process control system;\n- Deluge systems built into the process to quickly suppress chemical fumes or fires;\n- Check valves to prevent cross contamination of chemicals;\n- Fire prevention activities like electrical grounding, inerting flammables with nonflammable gases and hot work permitting; and\n- Operator surveillance during transfer of hazardous materials from shipping containers.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur are kept.  No off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage has occurred involving materials and processes covered under the EPA's RMP rule during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe site has an Emergency Response Plan, which establishes proc"

This plan consolidates all the federal, states, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Drills are conducted on a regular basis and are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of the site's process hazards review procedures, all of the processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  As a result of these studies, the site continues to implement a number of activities to help identify new risk reduction opportunities and maintain those already implemented. A few of those activities are:\n\n- Continue to improve the control of the process by installing better instrumentation, more automatic process shutdown interlocks, and upgraded computer control systems as replacements are needed;\n- Continue to perform preventive maintenance inspections and improve procedures;\n- Continue improvement of training programs; and \n- Continue conducting process safety audits to identify any deficiencies in the management systems.\n\n\nNote on Prevention Program ID 3 - Chlorine Storage\n\nThe chloroprene process uses chlorine as a raw material.  Chlorine usage at this process can require that four tanks be unloaded each day.  While the process is operating, the site tries to maintain twenty chlorine tank cars on-site with a stop order point at twenty-five tank cars.  Because the deliver time is seven days, the site may have thirty-five to forty tank cars when the process has a long unscheduled shutdown.  Chlorine storage of the tank cars was chosen as a process for RMP reporting purpose.\n\nThe chlorine tank cars are maintained, inspected and serviced by the chlorine supplier.  Once at the site, DPE performs visual inspections prior to unloading.  If a problem is found with the tank cars, the emergency response team will respon"

Due to the economic situation, this facility was not able to supply all the butadiene needed to maitain production levels for our customers.  A butadiene unloading facility was constructed to allow the site to receive butadiene railcars.  This facility was completed in July 31, 2009; the first butadiene railcar was unloaded on 9/29/2009.  No incidents have been experienced at this facility since it began operations."
