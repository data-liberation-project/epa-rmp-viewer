This facility has an Emergency Response Plan; however, it does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Tristar Transload PNW, Inc. - Vancouver Facility is a LPG Transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the LPG railcar storage and transloading system only, including the associated piping and storage for up to eight (8) butane and seven (7) storage tanks (detached railcars).\n\n\n\nThe Tristar Transload PNW, Inc. - Vancouver Facility complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This LPG railcar storage and transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (TRI-FLO Inc.) instructions.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nThis is a new facility; therefore, it has never had an accident involving LPG which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Tristar Transload PNW, Inc. - Vancouver Facility L"
