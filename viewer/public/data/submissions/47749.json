The diversity of products produced range from EPDM rubber, rubber additive products such as those to keep rubber flexible or aid in its vulcanization, anti-oxidants, to agricultural products.  Recognizing the growing public concern with chemical exposure, Chemtura Corporation - Geismar \"signed on\" to the Ascension Parish CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) program in 1985.  This organization is part of an on-going effort to maintain communications between industry and the general public with the appropriate law enforcement, emergency response personnel, and environmental agencies. This program integrates well with the existing Geismar Plant Emergency Response Procedures which are contained in the Geismar Policy Manual and include:\n     Bomb Threat,\n     Disaster Notification,\n     Release Reporting Procedures,\n     Incident Command/Planning and Response,\n     Assistance and Notification for Serious Injury,\n     Electrical Power Curtailment,\n     Gas Release Procedure,\n     Hurricane Preparedness,\n     Geismar Mutual Aid,\n     Plant Fire Brigade,\n     Riot and Civil Disturbances,\n     Steam Usage Curtailment,\n     Tornadoes,\n     Release Reporting Procedure,\n     Community Inquiry,\n     Security Reporting,\n     Hazwoper Safety and Health Plan, and\n     Unusual Incident Reporting\n\nThe requirements in the RMP regulation to prevent accidental releases are being met at the Geismar facility by established programs which include:\n     Operator training and certification,\n     Work Permits,\n     Hazard Communications,\n     Management of Change for Process and Equipment,\n     Process Hazard Analysis,\n     Reports of Unsafe Conditions,\n     Safety Orientations,\n     Emergency response training,\n     Routinely updated operating procedures,\n     Computers and computerized control systems,\n     Emergency c"

As a mark of this continuing improvement, the Geismar Plant is registered to the ISO 14001 international environmental standard and an OSHA VPP Star facility.\n\n\n\nRMP REPORTABLE CHEMICALS\n\nOf the 140 RMP chemicals, the Geismar Facility handles threshhold quantities of 9 of these chemicals (7 toxic and 2 flammable) with 17 covered processes identified.  Whenever possible, chemicals are handled by pipeline to reduce the impact in the event of a leak rather than stock-piling large amounts in storage tanks.  This is especially true in the handling of the \"worst case\" toxic chemical, chlorine, where a pipeline is preferably used over bulk storage with a 90-ton rail car, and the \"worst case\" flammable chemical, propylene, with a set of interconnected storage tanks totaling 315 tons.  These exposures only exists for a short term of from one to six weeks every three to five years when their pipelines must be taken out of service for maintenance and/or inspection.\n\nSixteen (numbers 1-14, 16 and 17) of the identified processes are Program 3 PSM processes which deal with raw material receiving, storage and handling and as such are controlled by all of the above mentioned \"prevention\" and \"emergency response\" programs.  These chemicals of concern are:\n\n     Chlorine  - Toxic\n\nProcess #1:  A 90-ton rail car of liquid chlorine is brought in and spotted near production unit 61 and is piped to a distribution manifold to provide chlorine for the manufacturing of specialty chemicals in production unit 61 and production unit 80.
