Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Henderson Terminal has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.   This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meetings with local emergency response organizations. \n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy which provides that:\n\n1)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public; \n2)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures; \n3)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals; \n4)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n \nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and /or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\nIt is the company\u00bfs policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, company trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  The company has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source(s) and Regulated Substance(s) Handled\nThe Henderson Terminal is engaged in the storage and transport of liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from river barges at the dock and transferred via an aboveground pipeline to two interconnected aboveground refrigerated storage vessels.  The liquid ammonia, stored in eac"

The anhydrous ammonia from this facility is typically used as a crop nutrient by various end users.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance present at the Henderson Terminal that exceeds the threshold planning quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Based on the quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at Henderson Terminal, the Henderson Terminal is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, and therefore, the Henderson Terminal satisfies the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP.  The Henderson Terminal has fully implemented OSHA's PSM standard requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. A brief summary of the facility's PSM program is as follows:\n\nThe Henderson Terminal encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention.  The Henderson Terminal has an employee participation plan that documents the many ways employees are involved in accident prevention and process safety.  \n\nThe Henderson Terminal keeps a wide variety of technical documents that are used to safely operate of the anhydrous ammonia process.   These documents address the chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key parameters of process operations.   Specific plant personnel have an assignment to keep this information up-to-date. \n\nThe Henderson Terminal has conducted  a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) to ensure that hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are identified and controlled. The Henderson Terminal periodically revalidates its PHA to incorporate regulatory changes, new developments"

The revalidation occurs at least every five years and the recommendations and resolutions are kept for the life of the process.  This revalidation process has been recently completed.  \n\nThe Henderson Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Conducting training; (2) Developing written procedures; (3) Performing inspections and tests in accordance with recognized standards; and (4) Correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.\n\nThe Henderson Terminal also has procedures in place to ensure continuation of the entire PSM program, including: writing and periodically updating operating procedures; training operators and maintenance personnel; management of change programs; contractor safety programs; plus developing an audit schedule that meets OSHA PSM requirements.\n\nMoreover, the Henderson Terminal has active mitigation measures in-place to prevent and/or minimize accidental releases.  These measures include: vessel construction standards, a vessel flare, safety relief valves, and continuous leak monitoring.\n\n4.  Five -Year Accident History\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.   The Henderson Terminal has had no accidental releases which meet the above criteria.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\nThe Henderson Terminal has a written emergency response plan.  It involves the use of trained emergency responders employed at Henderson, a coo"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Henderson Terminal is working to timely resolve all action items generated as a result of internal audits and process hazard analysis.  The Henderson Terminal has performed nondestructive testing on a scheduled basis on the anhydrous ammonia storage vessels to verify mechanical soundness from potential cracks and other sources of corrosion."
