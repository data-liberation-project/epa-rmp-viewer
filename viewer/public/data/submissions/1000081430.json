During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nCity of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the chlorine process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Chlorine\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process at the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant facility is an integral part of the overall business. The chlorination process utilizes six 2,000 lbs. containers, with another three containers stored outside in the chlorine storage area. Process management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of a chlorine leak. \r\n\r\nCity of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel monitor the chlorination process.

Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton containers by vacuum. This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the chlorine gas from the ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the chlorine feed regulator and rotameter mounted to the wall. The gas is injected into the feed water line where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is distributed to the location where it is needed in the treatment process. The analyzers monitor chlorine concentrations in the water and relay the information to the chlorine feed regulator in order to determine whether more or less chlorine should be injected.\r\n \r\nProcess Chemistry\r\n\r\nAt the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant chlorine gas (Cl2) is used for disinfection of water distributed to residential and irrigation customers. The chlorine, when added to water, yields both hydrochloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical equation below) in aqueous solution. This combinatio"

Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in off-gassing of chlorine gas from water that contains high concentrations of the acids.\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the ton containers through a pressure reducing valve, reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted inside a chlorinator, metered through a manually-adjusted rate valve, and finally injected into water. \r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\nThe City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant is equipped with multiple self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs) for changing the tanks. \r\nAll ton containers are chocked and stored securely in the chlorine storage area or the chlorine building pursuant to Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual. The chlorine building is not exposed to vehicular traffic and is locked after normal working hours. \r\nChlorine is fed through a vacuum regulator that ensures that the tubing containing chlorine operates in a vacuum. In the event that the vacuum is lost, the regulator will shut off chlorine feed.\r\nEach chlorine ton container at the City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Plant is protected from overpressure with three (3) fusible plugs on each side of the container (6 total). The fusible plugs consist of a brass plug with a fusible metal insert that is designed to melt between 157\u00baF-170\u00baF.\r\nVarious analog gauges are installed throughout the chlorine process for continuous monitoring of container weight and pressure. The ton containers in the chlorine building are also placed on a load-cell scale for additional container weight monitoring.\r\nEmergency eyewash and safety showers are located in various areas throughout the facility including in the chlorine building and can be used to decontaminate if chemical exposure occurs. \r\nThe chlorine building is equipped with an emergency ventilation fan that is interlocked"
