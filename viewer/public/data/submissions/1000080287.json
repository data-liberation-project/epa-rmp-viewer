(Radian) to assist in addressing the requirements under the federal Risk Management Program as mandated in the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r )(7).  The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics recently contracted with Ramboll US Corporation (Ramboll) to complete the five-year update of the original RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMP*eSubmit.

The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Introduction;\r\n\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances;\r\n\u00b7 Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\r\n\u00b7 Prevention Program;\r\n\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; and\r\n\u00b7 Planned Changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Willowbrook.

The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\r\n\r\n\u00b7 Process safety information accessible to employees at all times.\r\n\u00b7 A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\r\n\u00b7 Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\r\n\u00b7 Door interlock system.\r\n\u00b7 Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\r\n\u00b7 Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\r\n\u00b7 A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\r\n\u00b7 Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\r\n\u00b7 Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\r\n\u00b7 A thorough Preventative Maintenance program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\r\n\r\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the Sterigenics US LLC - Willowbrook facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide.
