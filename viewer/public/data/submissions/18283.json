We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nChlorine is used at the facility for the air scrubbing system.\n\nA.  Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies.\n\nTaylor By-Products takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of chlorine from the air scrubbing system.  Thes precautions include a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Safety Supervisor is responsible fo rthe management of the chlorine safety programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates a chlorine system with a chlorine inventory of 6,000 pounds.  Chlorine is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Wyalusing plant.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nEPA requires us to define the worst case release scenario from the Wyalusing plant as the release of all the chlorine from the largest vessel on site.  At our Wyalusing plant, this would be 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute period due to the failure of a 1-ton cylinder.  The 2,000 pounds represents the maximum amount of chlorine that would be contained in the cylinder at any time.  EPA also requires us to assume that the weather conditions are such that there is almost no wind and no mixing in the atmosphere.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the Wyalusing plant would involve the release of 1,170 pounds of chlorine over a 39 minute period due to failure of the regulator.  The duration of the release was estimated for the alternative release scenario by estimating the amount of time required to stop the leak.  Again, EPA required us to estimate the"

Our equipment and system were designed using industry standards for chlorine.  We have taken precautions to protect our equipment from obvious threats, like vehicular traffic.  We have a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine equipment.  Training programs are in place to ensure that qualified personnel operate the systems, and our emergency response procedures allow us to respond quickly in the event of an accident.  And lastly, the weather conditions used in estimating the extent of the releases are uncommon.\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n-  Employee Participation Program\n-  Process Safety Information\n-  Process Hazard Analysis\n-  Operating Procedures\n-  Training Program\n-  Contractor Safety Program\n-  Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n-  Mechanical Integrity Program\n-  Hot Work Permit Procedures\n-  Management of Change Procedures\n-  Incident Investigation Procedures\n-  Compliance Audit Procedures\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no chlorine related accidents at the Wyalusing plant in the past five years.\n\nF.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Wyalusing plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to chlorine releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe plant response team utilizes employees who are trained to enter and stop an accidental chlorine release.\n\nG.
