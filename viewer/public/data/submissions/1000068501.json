      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nShamrock Foods Company strives to operate its ammonia refrigeration system without negative incidents that will affect its operation and surrounding community.  The company will achieve this by ensuring the system design is by relevant standards and codes, and operated and maintained by competent service professionals or company personnel.\r\n\r\nTo help prevent and mitigate the results of negative incidents Shamrock implemented results of mechanical integrity studies, process hazard analysis, local fire department involvement, and installation by a licensed contractor.  However, the Shamrock site incorporated specific emergency response actions into emergency action plans to account for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company referenced the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for developing actions in case of a negative incident, and documented emergency response actions on the exterior of the ammonia refrigeration building, within the process safety management program, and within emergency response checklists.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES USED\r\nShamrock Foods Company occupies a warehouse type building for cold storage of dairy related products.  Shamrock uses an ammonia refrigeration system to maintain a cold dock, cooler, and freezer for receiving, storing, and shipping the food products.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system operates with approximately 14,000-17,000 pounds of ammonia, anhydrous.  If a system operates at greater than 10,000 pounds, a company is responsible for developing a Process Safety Management program under OSHA and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  These programs and plans help a company manage their risk of exposure to internal employees and the community.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system and does not consume or emit ammonia"

An ammonia refrigeration system will not have air emissions or water discharges from the process when the system is operated and maintained appropriately. \r\n\r\nGENERAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system received updates in accordance with current codes and standards in 2017.  The local fire department conducted several inspections during the 2017 update process to ensure the company engineered appropriate safeguards into the system.  A professional engineer specializing in ammonia refrigeration systems completed ultrasonic testing on the dump trap / oil pots and a refrigeration contractor performed a mechanical integrity review on the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nInstrumentation, controls and monitors the ammonia refrigeration system.  The company updated the ammonia refrigeration system by removing piping and equipment that no longer served a purpose for the refrigeration process. The company utilizes a continuous flow ventilation fan.  Emergency exhaust ventilation is available for emergency events.  One additional emergency exhaust ventilation fan was installed in addition to the existing in 2017.\r\n\r\nProcess equipment operates within design limits and is in good clean condition.  There is not excessive dirt, scale, or ice built up around the system.  The company secured equipment so it does not exhibit excessive vibration.\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls such as a Process Safety Management Program and Operating Procedures are in place to help prevent and mitigate releases.
