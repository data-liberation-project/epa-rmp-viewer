We have been doing business in the same location at 3724 Maumee Avenue, Fort Wayne, IN since 1962. We have used anhydrous ammonia in our processes since the start of business in 1962. In the early years our tank was owned by Hamler Industries now known as Tanner Industries. In 1992 Metallurgical Processing, Inc. purchased a larger tank. The capacity of this tank is 10,000 gallons and is still in use today. We have our ammonia delivered when our level reading is at 20%. At the time of delivery we take an average of 20,000 lbs. which is over the threshold limit allowable by the standard which does have the \"potential\" for a large volume release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nOur Health and Safety Manual adopted by Metallurgical Processing, Inc. is totally committed to the safety of all our employees. Our manual outlines programs that ensure a safe, accident free workplace for the benefit of our employees, customers, visitors and neighbors. Metallurgical Processing, Inc. is committed to these programs in the same way that we seek constant improvement in the heat treating processes that we perform.\n \nTo implement Safety and Health programs, employee training is essential. Through regularly scheduled classes our employees will be taught safe workplace practices pertinent to the equipment and environment in which they must function. The best way to operate the equipment in our plant is the safest way. \n\nA natural part of training is testing. From testing, we are able to evaluate the effectiveness of the training programs. By making our training/testing an ongoing requirement of our employees, we desire to improve their attitude as well as their mechanical skills in the area of Safety.\n\nOur Employee Manual, descriptive of employment circumstances, includes a section \"Shop Rules and Regulations\", which provides a thorough outline of the requirements we expect from our employees. Many items l"

It is the aim of Metallurgical Processing, Inc. to have Safety and Health programs, employee training, and disciplinary rules be compatible with the development of employee competence in their job and confidence in our company resulting in an efficient, safe work force.\n\nBecause we have control over the equipment utilized in our plant and the circumstances of employment, we are in the best position to prevent accidents through training and employee discipline. The programs contained in our Health and Safety Manual are based on Federal, Indiana and Fort Wayne regulations in conjunction with equipment manufacturer's operating instructions and guidelines.\n\n\nOur worse case and alternative release scenarios were modeled using the RMP Comp. ver. 1.06 consequence analysis format. Our anhydrous ammonia has the possibility of releasing 2500 lbs. per minute in each scenario. Our tank is located outside our facility in a concrete saddle. The ammonia is stored in the tank as a liquid under 100 lbs. of pressure. The accidental release will form a colorless cloud and the wind will move the cloud approximately 1.9 miles in the worst case scenario and .3 miles in the alternative scenario. It will affect urban area and approximately 5600 persons on any given day. We have persons trained to shut down the lines. All employees are trained to evacuate the building at the sound of the alarm horn and call the fire department.  To totally evacuate the building, we have installed a plant wide alarm system with a continuous sounding horn to alert all employees to get out of the building.  Also included in the training program, employees are shown the evacuation site and to not leave the premises. The lead person on that particular shift will account for all persons to make sure all employees are safe. \n\nTo disburse anhydrous ammonia water, is usually used. Inside a commercial heat treat water cannot be used because hot oil and a sprinkler system create an ev"

Evacuation is the only means to secure the safety of our employees and our surrounding neighbors. \n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with four (4) pop-off valves in case the pressure inside the tank increases beyond its set point. The tank is check by our ammonia vendor at the time of every fill to make sure the fill valves are functional and that the pressure is maintained. The State of Indiana inspects the tank every two (2) years and issues a certification which is on file.\n\nOur five-year accident history has nothing reportable. We have not had any leak or malfunction since the tank was installed in 1992. Metallurgical Processing, Inc. prides itself on securing equipment and keeping everything in good running order.\n\nOur emergency procedure for hazardous spills is that the tank containing the ammonia is so constructed that the probability of a rupture is too remote to address. On the other hand it is possible that piping from the tank and throughout the plant could under certain circumstances fail, even though all valves, pipes, fittings and controls are specifically designed for ammonia use.\nIn the event of an ammonia leak, the discoverer(s) should:\n\n1. Announce the location of the incident over the public address system.\n2. Sound the alarm for evacuation. Employees should seek shelter up-wind.\n3. Call the fire department.\n4. If so directed and properly trained, put on the protective gear and\na. Shut off the nearest supply valve.\nb. Hose down any liquid with water (if applicable).\n5. After order is restored, maintenance shall inspect all affected areas before restarting any machinery.\n\nEmergency drills are conducted yearly on all shifts for each type of emergency either fire, bomb threat, explosion, spill or earthquake which requires evacuation or seek shelter for severe weather. \n\nWith the consideration of our low incident rate history and our current staff, we are not at this time anticipating adding anything new to o"
