This document provides a brief overview of the following elements of the RMP:\n\n\n\n* The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\n* The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n* The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\n* The five-year accident history;\n\n* The emergency response program; and\n\n* The planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\n3M Elyria is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  3M Elyria employees have had operating procedures training and perform ongoing preventative maintenance on process equipment.  3M Elyria uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the hazards associated with the regulated chemicals used on site.  By maintaining these programs, 3M Elyria ensures the safety of plant personnel as well the safety of the public and the protection of the environment.     \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\n3M Elyria produces cellulose sponges.  The process uses highly refined wood pulp as a raw material and carbon disulfide, the only toxic chemical regulated under 40 CFR 68 at 3M Elyria, is added to the batch reactor to facilitate the production of the cellulose sponges.  Carbon disulfide is stored on site in a railcar, two storage tanks, and/or multiple day tanks. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\n3M Elyria takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of carbon disulfide as detailed below.  A hazard review is conducted every five years for the covered process. Prior to conducting the process hazard analysis, safety information is reviewed. The safety information reviewed includes information pertaining "

Process and safety information and operating procedures are updated when a change occurs with the process chemicals, technology, equipment, or operational procedures.  \n\n\n\nAnother element of 3M Elyria's accidental release prevention program is the operator checklist that verifies that operating procedures for the handling and transfer of carbon disulfide are conducted safely. To ensure that the operating procedures are correctly implemented all employees are on a three-year refresher-training schedule.  In addition to the refresher training, 3M Elyria trains operators in any new or updated procedures prior to startup of a process after modification.  Furthermore, personnel are trained in carbon disulfide emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the carbon disulfide system equipment is inspected and tested by maintenance personnel according to the schedule the 3M Elyria has established as good engineering practice.   \n\n\n\nIn addition to the above listed components of an effective prevention program, 3M Elyria's prevention program includes procedures for incident investigations. \n\n\n\nTo establish that 3M Elyria is successfully implementing all the aspects of the prevention program detailed above and that the covered process is in compliance with RMP regulations, an internal audit is conducted every three years.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nA five-year accident release report has not been prepared since there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.   \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\n3M Elyria has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Facility.  This plan is periodically reviewed and employees are trained in the proper execution and implementation of the prescribed procedures.  3M Elyria employees are trained to respond to incidental releas"
