This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at BLUE RIDGE that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBLUE RIDGE is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  BLUE RIDGE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at BLUE RIDGE; and programs to evaluate the hazards at BLUE RIDGE.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, BLUE RIDGE controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help limit injury to the public or the environment.  BLUE RIDGE provides response training to BLUE RIDGE personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department. The Canton Mill maintains an Emergency Response Team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. The Manager, Safety and Loss Prevention serves as the Vice-Chairman of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Response activities have also been discussed with the local emergency response agencies and citizens from the community.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, BLUE RIDGE established a management system headed by the mill's Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n1.2 BLUE RIDGE and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Canton Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill pri"

Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Analysis descriptions are included in the RMPlan.\n\n \n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nThe Canton Mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the Canton Mill formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements.  BLUE RIDGE has implemented the prevention program requirements, which are as follows:\n\nProgram 3 level processes - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation.  This prevention program has been established for the Chlorine Dioxide System and Chlorine Water Treatment System\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of BLUE RIDGE'S prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n1.4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Canton Mill Program 3 prevention program, which applies to the Chlorine Dioxide System and the Chlorine Water Treatment System processes, consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.\tProcess Safety Information."

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled in these processes, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment in a part.  This process safety information is available to all BLUE RIDGE employees, and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at BLUE RIDGE, including regulated substances in covered processes.  Information on the technology and engineering design of the covered processes include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the process equipment.\n\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects or, in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analyses of the process.  Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2. \tProcess Hazard Analysis. The Canton Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  BLUE RIDGE primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.

The BLUE RIDGE management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.\tPre-startup Review.  BLUE RIDGE performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.
