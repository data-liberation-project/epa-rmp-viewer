If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the unlaoding from truck, anhydrous ammonia, into our storage tanks and then to transfer from storage tanks into nurse tanks.  These nurse tanks are used by our farmer customers to apply nitrogen to their crops. The maximum quanity stored in our storage tanks is 49,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This location has 12 moblie nurse tanks with total possible storage of 48,000 pounds, which would make the total onsite storage of 97,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Total volume figured by water capacity at 85% with a density of 5.5 lbs/gallon.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 49000 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest tank at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on industry records and the most likely potentail incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nBecause our firm handels anhydrous ammonia, we are regulated by DOT, EPA, OSHA, and The Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects our facilities on an annual basis.  These regulation along with the extensive training and standards our company uses, has led us to an excellent safety record.  We have had reportable accidents with annhydrous ammonia in the last five years.  We are very proud of this record.  In the event we would"

In addition the training our employees are required to have , addresses ammonia accidents and proper procedures we must take to mitigate any accidental release.\n\nEach year we report to the state, LEPC and to the local fire department what kinds of hazardous materials we are keeping on this site.  In addition we have employees at our facility who are on the volunteer fire departmet which futher helps coordination of our response efforts.\n\nWe strive to maintain our excellent safety record by updating our employee training on an annula basis or as changes are made in the safety processes.  This company has a inspection and maintenace program that allows equipment in ecellent working condition to be maintained for the safety of our coustomers and emplyees."
