Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Stephenson Service Company are committed to the \n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental \n\nrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Orangeville fire \n\ndepartment, Stephenson County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release\n\n and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 12009 N Afolkey Rd.Orangeville IL, 61060, is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for \n\ndirect application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system \n\nconsists of storage tanks, loading risers, associated \n\nplumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to \n\nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized \n\ncontractors.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario. \n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is\n\nsecurity-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by\n\nEPA regulations.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \n\napplicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions \n\nof \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-\n\n61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted \n\nby state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \n\nAdministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous \n\nAmmonia\". The propane facility was designed and constructed in accordance with \n\nNFPA-58. Compl"

Five year accident history.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five \n\nyears that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the \n\nfacility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter \n\nin place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n\n1910.38;\n\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community \n\nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n- a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR \n\n1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Orangeville Fire Department and Stephenson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are \n\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific \n\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time."
