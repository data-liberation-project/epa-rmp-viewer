The Emergency Action Plan integrates with a ER Levels of Response procedure to:\n\n--isolate the area and/or isolate releasing substance (if it is safe to do so), \n\n--notify personnel on site of the release and evacuate (if necessary due to size or location of release),\n\n--notify nearby businesses of the release (if necessary due to size or location of release),\n\n--clean incidental spills,\n\n--contact third party emergency response team / HazMat Clean-Up company for assistance if necessary, \n\n--contact local fire department for assistance if necessary,\n\n--contact law enforcement agencies for assistance and/or flag down traffic to prevent entry into release, if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety: \n\nAs is our policy at Air Liquide, we continue to review our process(es) for possible improvements to the process and operational methods and evaluate new technology to lower risk. The Dallas Chemical Center conducts and resolves all findings from its PHA and other hazard and utilizes a Management of Change Program to evaluate proposed changes prior to implementation.\n\n"
