If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Clemons Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer and chemical sales business.  We offer anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers for growing corn.  The ammonia plant cosists of one 18,000 gal tank plus associated piping and valves.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the storage tank when it is filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud.  According to EPA tables the end point is 5.6 miles.  Withing the distance to the endpoint there is a population of 2027.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia storage, it is our policy to notify the Clemons Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWe do not plan any additional changes."
