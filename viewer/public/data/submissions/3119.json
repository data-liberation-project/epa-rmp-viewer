Prillaman Chemical is an industrial chemical distributor that provides products in support of industries ranging from food and water treatment to textiles and furniture.  Activities include warehousing, packaging, bulk transfer and formulation of many common industrial chemicals.  We serve Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nWe are members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and as members we pledge to manage our business according to the principles of the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process.  This process provides a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety and environmental performance of our company and is designed to be sensitive and responsive to community needs and public concerns.  In addition, Prillaman Chemical has a Quality Improvement process that makes safety and environmental concerns an on-going priority.  \n\nAs Team Members of Prillaman Chemical and as members of our communities we are committed to the safe handling of the products that we distribute as well as the safe operation of our facilities, but we also recognize that emergencies relating to those activities can occur.  It is our policy to ensure that emergency response units and the public will have adequate information to allow them to react properly to emergencies which could result from our activities.  Accordingly, we have written procedures, which we will utilize to minimize the effects of such events.  \n\nFacility Information:\nThe Prillaman Chemical Corporation, Fayetteville facility, is located at 334 Worth Street, City of Fayetteville, County of Cumberland, North Carolina.  The facility site is located approximately one half mile south of downtown Fayetteville, in an industrialized area.  The facility site occupies a total of 2.127 acres which consists of 3 warehouses with loading and unlo"

This site is an in transit storage location for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide 150 and 2000 pound cylinders which are regulated under the EPA's Risk Managment Program (RMP), 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\nThis site has safely stored Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide cylinders for over 5 years without a single incident.  \n\nRelease Senarios:\nAll release senarios were modeled using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants\nReference Tables or Equations.  The worst case scenario for a 2000 pound cylinder is a  release at a rate of 200 lbs/min. for 10 minutes.  This scenario assumed a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class in an urban area which would effect an area of 1.3 miles for both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  The receptors of this area would be residences, businesses, hospitals, recreational areas, schools, major commercial and public offices and the county prison facility.\n\nThe alternate release senarios would be a release of one pound per minute for 150 minutes from a 150 pound cylinder.  This senarioo assumed a wind speed of 1.5 metters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class in an urban area.  This senario could affect a area up to one tenth of a mile (0.10).  Within that area the public receptor would be light industry.   No schools, residences, hospitals, recreational areas, correctional facilities, environmental receptors or commercial areas would be effected.  \n\nPrevention Programs:\nThe Prillaman Chemical, Fayetteville facility stores and distributes the RMP regulated materials Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, these materials are not filled or consumed on site.  Each cylinder is of heavy guage steel construction and each valve is covered with a steel protective cap to prevent any damage to the valve.  All cylinders are inspected for any potential problems during the unloading, loading "
