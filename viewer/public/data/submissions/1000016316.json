(A?JasmineA?) is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program. Jasmine has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document Jasmine policies addressing the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Jasmine Pond Road facility provides product cooling and long-term storage for table grapes.\n \nThe facility is located in a rural area outside Delano. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (\"System\"). This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, which was installed in 2003. The full system charge and start-up occurred August 2003. As of August 2010, an expansion of the original facility and refrigeration system is in progress. The ammonia equipment is located inside and outside. Compressors and evaporators are located inside. However, valves and piping serving the evaporator are located on the roof.\n\nAccess to the facility is limited by a combination of fencing and gates on the property perimeter.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO AN"

      "SummaryText": "ALYSIS\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system  - in either design or operation. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\nALTERNATE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario. \n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nJasmine's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Jasmine is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey objectives of JasmineA?s Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2. Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Jasmine. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n\n4. Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. Jasmine certifies operators following completion of operator training and Jasmine's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training chapter."

      "SummaryText": ")\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all Jasmine employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6. Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned  (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Jasmine's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Jasmine has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Jasmine Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7. Verification of Jasmine's compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program  (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented "

(Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n8. Minimize employee injury and illness. (Addressed under Jasmine's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Jasmine facility has no accidental ammonia releases which require inclusion in the Five Year Accident History.\n\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nJasmine's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the facility.\n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies. The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary. The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators. Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \n\nUnder Jasmine's Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Jasmine employees who have been trained as \"First Responders\" may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment). Jasmine will evacuate affected area, begin notification process, and rely on the fire department personnel who have been trained as required by CFR 1910.120 (q) to respond to the incident.  The ERP is coordinated with the local fire department\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study team developed recommendations to improve safety and to reduce the possibility of a release.\nKey recommendations were identified during the most recent PHA study included;\n\n1. Establish additional written procedures for practices and maintenance\n\n Jasmine has established a schedule to complete implementation of the measures.\n"
