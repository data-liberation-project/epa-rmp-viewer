      "SummaryText": "This facility is a publicly operated wastewater treatment plant that provides service to approximately 20,000 residences and a variety of businesses and small industries. This plant utilizes holding ponds, oxidation ponds, digester, and a clarifier in cleaning wastewater for ultimate discharge into the Yazoo River.  The plant currently has an emergency response plan prepared by Mr. Terry Ricks and employees receive periodic safety training and procedures for responding to an emergency release. At any one time there can be as many as six - 2,000 lb. steel cylinders containing chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process to purify the affluent before discharge.  Chlorine in the cylinder is compressed to a liquid state and when discharged through a regulator into the affluent stream becomes gas and is absorbed into the water for sterilization.  The CAS# for chlorine is 7782-50-5.  The regulated level for chlorine is 2,500 lbs.; therefore this facility must have a risk management plan.  In the worst case scenario chlorine, which is heavier than air could have a harmful affect on residents up to 1.9 miles at night.  Since this plant functions on a twenty-four hour basis the worst case scenario is considered to be contact with two tanks releasing a total of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine instantaneously. In this case an immediate evacuation downwind would be required, this procedure is addressed in the emergency response plan.  The facility is surrounded by a six-foot high levy to protect against flooding.  This levy would act to contain the chlorine in the facility unless a significant wind was blowing which would result in a dilution of the chlorine gas.  Exposure to chlorine gas could cause skin irritation and severe breathing problems.  Terrain in the area is extremely flat, therefore any chlorine release would tend to spread and reduce the thickness of the layer.  There are no ravines or pockets in the area where chlorine gas may concentrate.\n\nThis facilit"

      "SummaryText": "y will be implementing an accident release prevention program.  This program includes installing a chlorine detector that will sound an alarm when any release occurs.  Revising the method of handling cylinders so that no full cylinder will be moved over another full cylinder, therefore greatly minimizing the worst case scenario of two cylinders impact with both rupturing.  Also the lift height for chlorine filled cylinders will be reduced to less than a foot, further minimizing the chance of a release.\n\nTo control exposure to minor releases, a ventilization system will be installed that will enable operators to circulate air when regulators and check valves are being transferred from an empty cylinder to a full cylinder.\n\nThe five year accident history shows one minor release described as from one to twenty pounds that occurred when the old valves were in use and the cylinder was improperly positioned causing liquid to release into the atmosphere.  The new regulators with check valves will eliminate the possibility of this type of release.\n\nChanges to improve safety consist of the following: using new regulators, frequent replacement of the gas supply lines to the effluent, a more logical and safe procedure for handling chlorine filled cylinders and the availability of air-pak's should the operator be required to close a cylinder valve experiencing a minor release which is your only alternative scenario."
