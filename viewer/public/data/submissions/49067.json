Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHarborside Refrigerated Services is dedicated to operation of a safe facility for its employees, visitors,  and neighboring community. A safety committee has been established that is responsible for the implementation of the safety program and an Emergency Response Plan.  Harborside Refrigerated Services has prepared risk and safety programs to ensure safe handling of the ammonia in the refrigeration system. Harborside Refrigerated Services conducted the following technical studies to identify potential hazards and the appropriate mitigation measures: Process Hazard Analysis, a Hazard Assessment, and a Seismic Assessment.\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\u00a6 The Harborside Refrigerated Services facility is located at 802 Terminal Street in San Diego, California. \n\n\u00a6 The Harborside Refrigerated Services ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and heat transfer equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide  cooling for the Cold Storage warehouse.  \n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Hot gas discharge from the compressors provides heating by transferring heat from the hot gas to the glycol and brine.  Additional heat is removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 3.6 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side.  \n\n\u00a6 Ammonia is the regulated substance at"

Hazard Assessment Summary\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n\u00a6 Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest vessel in 10 minutes.  The largest vessel in the system is the High Pressure Receiver, which has a capacity to hold the entire ammonia charge of 22,000 pounds.  Since the High Pressure Receiver is located outside in the Mechanical / Electrical Area, the building would not mitigate an ammonia release.  Thus, passive mitigation effects were not taken into account.  The total release rate is 2,200 pounds per minute.  This release rate was used to determine the endpoint distance of 200 ppm.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability for an urban topography.  \n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n\u00a6 Scenario Description: A release of ammonia from a 1/4 inch diameter leak.  This could result from a valve stem leak, a flange seal leak, or a line break.  The release rate of ammonia due to the line pressure (150 psig) is 120 pounds per minute and continues for about an hour.  A conservative estimate is a release of 7,300 pounds in a 60-minute period.  It was assumed that this scenario occurred outside, and did not include any administrative controls to limit the amount of ammonia released but did include mitigation by automatic and/or manual shut down mechanisms to terminate the release within 60 minutes.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability for an urban topography.  \n\n\nD. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAdministrative Measures\n\nHarborside Refrigerated Services has prepared management programs for compliance with the Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention regulations.

In addition, Harborside Refrigerated Services has conducted studies to identify potential hazard associated with the ammonia refrigeration system and set up a structure to ensure that recommendations from these studies are addressed.\n\nHarborside Refrigerated Services personnel circulate throughout the facility, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of any of the system several times each day.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Harborside Refrigerated Services employee, it is immediately reported to the Maintenance Engineer.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\nEngineering Measures\n\nHarborside Refrigerated Services was designed and constructed in accordance with ammonia refrigeration industry safety and design standards (Uniform Mechanical Code) and includes several monitoring and sensing devices.  These devices will activate alarms when conditions vary beyond designated limits.  The alarms are indicated on local instrumentation panels, the facility-wide alarm system, and remote alarms at the facility.  Some alarms will be responded to manually while others are interlocked to another device.  The ammonia refrigeration system at the facility is controlled and monitored using the following:\n\n\u00a6 process indicators and alarms;\n\u00a6 inspections;\n\u00a6 preventative maintenance;\n\u00a6 personnel training;\n\u00a6 incident investigations; and\n\u00a6 ammonia gas sensor.\n\nEach of these items is detailed in the \u00bfPrevention Program 3 section of this RMPlan.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, and ASME standards applicable at the time of construction for piping and vessels (ASME Section VIII Division I Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, and ASME B31.5 Refrigeration Piping Code), the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.\n\n\nE."

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\nF.  Emergency Response\n\nHarborside Refrigerated Services has an Emergency Evacuation Plan that includes requirements for postings, reporting emergencies, evacuation procedures / routes (including re-entry and accountability), and communications.  The Evacuation Plan included an Emergency Command system as the organizational framework.  In addition, the facility\u00bfs ammonia detection alarms are interlocked to an automatic dialer system that will notify the Maintenance Engineer. \n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation, performed on February 20, 2007, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Harborside Refrigerated Services facility located in San Diego, California.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Harborside Refrigerated Services safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
