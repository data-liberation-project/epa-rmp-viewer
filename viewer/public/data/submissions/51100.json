Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Houston plant is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Houston plant.  It is Houston plant policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Houston plant's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacture, due to which regulated substances could be stored and/or handled on site.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid), Sulfur Trioxide (liquefied), Carbon Disulfide, Vinyl Acetate, Toluene Di-isocyanate, Propionitrile, Acrylonitrile, Methyl Mercaptan, Ethyl Mercaptan, Acetaldehyde, Allyl Alcohol, Propylene Oxide, Hydrazine, Hydrogen Sulfide, Isopropylamine, 1-Butene, Propylene, and Propane.  Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid) is used as a chemical intermediate, as a drying agent and is a raw material for dyes and detergents. Sulfur trioxide is used as an intermediate in the production of high purity sulfuric acid for use in the electronics industry.  Carbon Disulfide, Toluene Di-isocyanate, Propionitrile, Acrylonitrile, Vinyl Acetate, Allyl Alcohol, Propylene Oxide, Hydrazine, Hydrogen Sulfide, Acetaldehyde, Isopropylamine, 1-Butene, Propane, Propylene, Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan could be received as waste streams for energy recovery and raw material value.  \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Houston plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of th"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Houston plant.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHouston Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Houston plant conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP (Hazard and Operability),  Fault Tree and LOPA (Layer of Protection Analysis).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the Houston plant covered processes, the plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Houston Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHouston Plant carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems,"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Houston Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Houston Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Houston Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Houston Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Houston Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improv"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the Houston plant hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Houston Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nRhodia, Houston Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to the Houston plant's stringent release prevention policies, only 2 accidental releases off-site have occurred over the last 5 years. The releases occurred on 10/18/2003 and 08/08/2006, both involving Sulfur Trioxide.  No deaths occurred offsite from these releases.  Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nHouston Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nIn order to encourage continuous improvement in all elements of Process Safety at the Houston plant reports to all employees on the progress of improvement eff"
