At this site Chlorine, which is used for disinfection of treated water is stored in reportable amounts. The storage vessels are one ton cylinders and vary from one cylinder in the winter months up to three cylinders in the summer months. In the past five years the treatment plant has not experienced any releases of liquid or gaseous chlorine of reportable amounts.  \n\nChlorine safety has been an item of paramount importance to the Company for many years. In 1981 all treatment plant personal were required to attend chlorine safety training classes that included daily chlorine operations and tank leak repair. Classes were continued on a yearly basis to assure up to date training. In 1990 the local fire department was contacted to conduct the safety training classes. The responsibility for tank leak repair was also turned over to the local fire department when new regulations made it impracticable to train all personal to the new criteria.\n\nThe plant continues to keep emergency equipment includes a tank repair kit and self-contained breathing apparatus at the site.\n\nIn 1987 the plant was upgraded and the chlorine room was isolated from the main plant, the entire room is visible through a glass window and external alarms are audible in the main operations room. The chlorine room has external access only. The feed system was changed to a totally vacuum system, which will shut chlorine feed at the tank if vacuum is lost in the feed system. An additional alarm was added for detection of any chlorine leakage in the chlorine room and a chlorine exhaust system was installed.\n\nUsing the worst-case scenario on OCA Guidance a .9 mile radius from the plant was obtained, this agrees with the 1.0-mile radius we have b"
