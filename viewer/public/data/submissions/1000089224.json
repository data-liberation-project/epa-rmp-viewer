      "SummaryText": "Blue Racer Midstream, LLC, a joint venture between First Reserve and Caiman Energy II, LLC, owns and operates the Natrium NGL Extraction and Fractionation plant.  The Natrium Facility is located in Marshall County West Virginia and includes three cryogenic processing plants and two fractionators.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nBlue Racer Midstream, LLC (Blue Racer) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Blue Racer's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   Also, Blue Racer has coordinated response activities with the Washington Lands Fire and Rescue Department.  \n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe Facility is a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) extraction and fractionation Facility. The combined extraction and fractionation Facility extracts NGL from a 1 Bcfd (four hundred million standard cubic feet per day) inlet production natural gas stream delivered by pipeline. The Plant is designed to fractionate a total of approximately 150,000 bbl/day of product (C2+), of which approximately 144,000 bbl/day of product are estimated to be from the inlet gas stream and 200 bbl/day are estimated to be NGLs imported by truck from other liquids extraction processing facilities nearby. The product from the extraction/fractionation process includes natural gasoline, propane, isobutane, and normal butane, which are sent to dedicated storage tanks and ethane and methane to pipelines.  Propane, isobutane and normal butane are regulated substances present in the process above their threshold quantities (10,000 pounds"

      "SummaryText": ") for applicability under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in an amount that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds).  Thus, NGL product is also subject to the RMP requirements.\n\nThe Blue Racer facility in Natrium added four iso-butane storage vessels to the Natrium site in December 2015. A PHA for that process was conducted in 2019 and used the HAZOP, What If and Checklists methodologies to identify process hazards associated with the new vessels. This RMP is being resubmitted because of the addition of these storage vessels, along with converting US-805 from NGLs storage to propane storage and the addition of Cryo 3. \n\n\n\nA.    The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nSince there are no toxic chemicals handled above the threshold quantities at the Natrium facility, the Offsite Consequence Analysis was carried out only for the flammable mixtures.  To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked.\n\n\n\ni.    Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumed that the vessel with the largest amount of propane (Propane Tank US-800) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp&trade;, an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint. The entire weight of the regulated substance is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.  These calculations are based on equation C-1 from EPA's OCA Guidance Document. Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour).\n\n\n\nii.    Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nThe alternative-case scenario assumed a transfer hose rupture caused a tank truck to empty in the truck "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Natrium maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
