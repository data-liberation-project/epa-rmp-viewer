      "SummaryText": "Blue Racer Midstream, LLC, a joint venture between First Reserve and Caiman Energy II, LLC, owns and operates the Natrium NGL Extraction and Fractionation plant.  The Natrium Facility is located in Marshall County West Virginia and includes three cryogenic processing plants and two fractionators.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nBlue Racer Midstream, LLC (Blue Racer) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Blue Racer's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.   Also, Blue Racer has coordinated response activities with the Washington Lands Fire and Rescue Department.  \n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe Facility is a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) extraction and fractionation Facility. The combined extraction and fractionation Facility extracts NGL from a 1 Bcfd (four hundred million standard cubic feet per day) inlet production natural gas stream delivered by pipeline. The Plant is designed to fractionate a total of approximately 150,000 bbl/day of product (C2+), of which approximately 144,000 bbl/day of product are estimated to be from the inlet gas stream and 200 bbl/day are estimated to be NGLs imported by truck from other liquids extraction processing facilities nearby. The product from the extraction/fractionation process includes natural gasoline, propane, isobutane, and normal butane, which are sent to dedicated storage tanks and ethane and methane to pipelines.  Propane, isobutane and normal butane are regulated substances present in the process above their threshold quantities (10,000 pounds"

      "FacilityID": 1000089224,
      "SummaryText": ") for applicability under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in an amount that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds).  Thus, NGL product is also subject to the RMP requirements.\n\nThe Blue Racer facility in Natrium added four iso-butane storage vessels to the Natrium site in December 2015. A PHA for that process was conducted in 2019 and used the HAZOP, What If and Checklists methodologies to identify process hazards associated with the new vessels. This RMP is being resubmitted because of the addition of these storage vessels, along with converting US-805 from NGLs storage to propane storage and the addition of Cryo 3. \n\n\n\nA.    The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nSince there are no toxic chemicals handled above the threshold quantities at the Natrium facility, the Offsite Consequence Analysis was carried out only for the flammable mixtures.  To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked.\n\n\n\ni.    Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumed that the vessel with the largest amount of propane (Propane Tank US-800) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp&trade;, an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint. The entire weight of the regulated substance is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.  These calculations are based on equation C-1 from EPA's OCA Guidance Document. Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour).\n\n\n\nii.    Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nThe alternative-case scenario assumed a transfer hose rupture caused a tank truck to empty in the truck "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Natrium maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP method is used to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with exper"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  These procedures are updated as needed.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at Natrium.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits will be conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and conducted at least once every three years.  Audit findings will be documented in a report and corrective actions required from the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and documented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be promptly investigated.  An incident investiga"

All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Natrium maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training will be conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed.  Employee training is documented and records of training will be maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures.  Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper installation an"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - Blue Racer believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit - Hot work permits for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process will be issued by facility safety leaders.  The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nContractors - Blue Racer hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work on the Natrium Facility, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances, the safe work procedures insisted on by Blue Racer, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures used at Natrium.  Contractors are informe"
