These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of incidents.\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. values the safety of our employees and area residents.  We are committed to responsible chemical processing and handling.  As an example of our commitment, the plant and the United Steel Workers Union, Local 2-0591 have joined together to implement the Triangle of Prevention (TOP) Program to further enhance safety, health, and protection of the environment.\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. takes pride in our commitment to protect the environment.  We are dedicated to continuous reduction of waste, and have a comprehensive program designed to promote recycling and waste minimization.  We have substantially reduced waste and emissions in recent years.\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. also participates in the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care initiative.  Through Responsible Care, our company and industry demonstrate its continuing commitment to health, safety, and the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe Taminco Higher Amines, Inc. Riverview Plant is located at 17168 West Jefferson Avenue, Riverview, Michigan.  The facility manufactures industrial chemicals, primarily alkanolamines.  Our products are used to produce a wide variety of products including cosmetics, paints, cleaners, tires, water treatment products, and agricultural chemicals.  \n\nCertain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  \n\nDimethylamine, ethylene oxide, furan, and isopropylamine and ethylamine are used as process feedstocks.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. has a prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardou"

This prevention program covers those processes that handle covered chemicals above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n -In-depth process hazard analyses are completed at least every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n -Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n -Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n -A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly;\n\n -A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n -Critical equipment, including instruments, is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating conditions;\n\n -Pre-startup reviews are done to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n -Incidents, including near-misses, are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; \n\n -Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed;\n\n -Periodic process walk-through inspections are conducted by supervisors; and\n\n -Routine safety meetings are held where managers and hourly participate.\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in accident reduction.  The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reduci"

We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and in internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the Taminco Higher Amines, Inc. facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire departments, and other emergency responders have copies of these plans.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.  The plan also includes documentation of proper first-aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; a description of the training program for employees in relevant emergency response procedures; and procedures for review and update of the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the facility, and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.  \n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. also has an on-site Emergency Response Team that performs regular emergency response drills and critiques of the drills.  Some drills are done with the local fire and police departments and critiqued by members of the community.  Taminco Higher Amines, Inc. on-site emergency equipment includes a fully equipped fire truck with fire fighting foam capability and a 2,000-gallon vacuum truck for quickly collecting spills.  There are first-aid trained personnel on each shift.  The Taminco Higher Amines, Inc. Emergency Response Team receives over 40 hours of annual emergency response training. \n\n  \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. is improving monitoring a"
