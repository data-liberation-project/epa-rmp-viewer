If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Baltimore City Fire Department as well as the Baltimore City/County EMA/LEPC.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (Medic-5 and Medic-9) and Harbor Hospital.  This facility trains its employees to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Baltimore Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one butane storage vessel.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's single butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Baltimore Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n\nThis is a new process, thus this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the"
