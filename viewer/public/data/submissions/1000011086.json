This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one butane storage vessel.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's single butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Baltimore Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n\nThis is a new process, thus this facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the"
