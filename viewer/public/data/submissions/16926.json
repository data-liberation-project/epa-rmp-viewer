(GMOI), Kansas City, Missouri, facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to GMOI employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nGMOI management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe GMOI facility produces several grades of flour and Bisquick(r). Support operations include a grain elevator, warehouse, a quality assurance/control laboratory, and administrative offices. Figure 1-1 shows the site location. Figure 1-2 shows the site plan.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. The chemical is chlorine and is used to bleach the flour.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a chlorine release included a release of all the contents of one of the 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This release translates to a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes or 200 pounds/min. Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are:  the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the cylinder is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is"

The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the plume must travel 3.23 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm). Figure 1-3 shows the worst-case release radius.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from failure of a chlorine valve on the high pressure line. The release area is assumed to have a diameter of 3/8 inch. The release is assumed to continue for a total of 60 minutes. The operating pressure of the cylinder is assumed to be 150 psig. The alternative-release rate was derived from the following equation, which is based on the pipe size, tank pressure, and the properties of chlorine.\n     \n\n        where:        QR =    Release rate (pounds per minute)\n                HA =    Hole or puncture area = p/4 d2 = p/4 (3/8 in)2 = 0.11 in2\n                Pt =    Tank pressure (pounds per square inch - absolute (psia)) =         14.7 psi + 94 psig = 108.7 psia (absolute)\n                Tt =    Tank temperature (K) = 700F x 4.2 K/0F = 294 K\n                GF =    Gas Factor, incorporating discharge coefficient, ratio of         specific heats, molecular weight, and conversion factors =         29 (EPA guidance document Appendix B, Exhibit B-1).\n\n        Therefore:\n     \n        QR = 20.3 pounds per minute\n\n        This equation gives an estimate of the release rate.\n\nFrom Reference Table 17, Dense Gas Distances to Toxic Endpoint - 60 Minute Release, Urban Conditions, D Stability, Wind Speed 3.0 Meters per Second the distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l is 0.54 miles. Figure 1-4 shows the alternate case release scenario.\n\nNo active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place. The meteorological data used for this alternative-release scenario was a wind speed of 3 meter/sec, an atmospheric stability classification of D (neutral stability), and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevent"

      "SummaryText": "ion Steps\n\nThe Kansas City facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and to the environment. These regulations include:\n\n7 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n7 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n7 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\n The key concepts in GMOI release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by GMOI management. Key personnel are responsible for operating this system and GMOI has contracted American Ingredients, Inc. to provide the required maintenance of the system.\n\nGMOI's policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes. This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.\n\nGMOI is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures. New employees are provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility. In addition, GMOI conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to mill personnel for the chlorine system.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nGMOI has not had a release of chlorine from Kansas City that has affected their employees, the public or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nGMOI does not have an emergency response team on site. Their policy is to contact the local Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat 71), a division of the Kansas City Fire Department, in the event of an emergency. HazMat 71 has toured the Ka"

GMOI has defined emergencies in their emergency response plan and has trained site personnel on the appropriate actions to take.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGMOI and American Ingredients, Inc. completes a thorough review of the chlorine systems each time a design change is implemented. The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised. GMOI is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems. The following work activities will be completed prior to June 22, 1999:\n\n1. Place a bump guard around the chlorine line behind the grinder roll rack on the sixth floor\n\n2. Refasten the upper pipe clamp on the chlorine line on the sixth floor\n\n3. Place screens on the chlorine vent lines to prevent insects from nesting in the lines\n\n4. Cap the abandoned C Mill and A Mill chlorine lines at the closest point to the current active lines\n\n5. Add chlorine labels to the overhead chlorine lines in A and B Mill on the first floor\n\n6. Repair the chlorine sensor box in the chlorine room\n\n7. Add chlorine awareness to general contractor training program\n "
