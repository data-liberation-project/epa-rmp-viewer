Review of relief systems for adequacy and change as necessary to handle worst emergency case.\r\n2.)  Addition of more alarms and reviews of set points of existing alarms for adequacy.\r\n3.)  Addition of more instrumentation to better monitor process conditions at more points along the process train.\r\n4.)  Installation of back-flow prevention measures to avert hazardous contamination or mixing of incompatible chemicals.\r\n5.)  Revision of standard operation procedures to clarify process steps and to eliminate possible confusion or error.\r\n6.)  Maintain a mechanical integrity and prevention maintenance program to monitor critical equipment and instrumentation and to minimize unforseen failures.\r\n7.)  Updated all plant drawings to reflect equipment and piping changes to provide an accurate tool for site personnel.\r\n8.)  Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analyses have been compleeted to meet the five year revalidation frequency per OSHA.\r\n9.)  Implementation of Safety Instrumented Systems program.\r\n10.)

The last RMP was submitted June 19, 2014.\r\n\r\nAt the Nalco Champion Freeport Plant, we are committed to operating and to maintaining our process in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Managemet Program (the RMP rule).  One element of the RMP rule is a Risk Managemet Plan (RMPlan) which details accident prevention measures and safeguards.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk managemt program.\r\n\r\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are vital to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.  The Nalco Champion Freeport Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances we use.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained responders will act to control and contain the release.  We work with local emergency response organizations to evaluate potential releases and to formulate appropriate responses to contain and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of such a release.  Nalco Champion in conjunction with the local emergency planning and response organizations, has established a means to warn the surrounding communities in the event of a release which would threaten the public.\r\n\r\n2.
