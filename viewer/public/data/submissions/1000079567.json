              "Description": "This prevention program applies to a single chlorine gas storage and supply unit. Design and construction of the original unit was accomplished by outside firms in 1985. All applicable building and equipment codes were adhered to. Updates incorporating new safety features were designed and constructed in 2006. Employees were trained in the use of new systems. Standard Operating Procedures exist for operating the process. Maintenance is handled by trained maintenance personnel. To increase safety, the chemical building has been enclosed, the chlorine gas feed system has been converted from a pressure/vacuum system to  a virtually complete vacuum system, and a scrubber installed which will handle the release from one full container. Alarm systems are built in and response procedures to system leaks defined.",

      "SummaryText": "The City of Odessa operates a water treament plant located at 811 W. 42nd Street in Odessa, Ector County, Texas. As part of the treatment process, the water is disinfected using chloramines. Chloramines are formed when chlorine is combined with an ammonia source. The source of chlorine is a 100% gas stored in a maximum total of 16 possible 2,000 containers. Chlorine gas is the only covered process.\n\n\n\nDue to the ongoing presence of chlorine gas at this facility, the City of Odessa has developed a program to ensure the safe handling of this chemical. This safety program has been reviewed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program and revised to comply with its provisions and enhance the existing program. The City of Odessa is committed to allocating the manpower and financial resources required to implement all facets of the Risk Management Program and thereby reduce the potential for an accidental release chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequence analyses submitted have been reviewed by City of Odessa staff and found to be valid. The analyses defines the area potentially affected by the release(s) of chlorine gas allowing the identification of residential populations, public and environmental receptors, industrial and commercial sites, and natural sites such as parks. No changes to the process have been made since the last submittal.\n\n\n\nAs a part of the City's Risk Management Plan, the City reviewed the most recent five-year period to determine if any accidental releases or incidences which could have resulted in a reportable accidental release had occurred. \n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program for the City of Odessa contains several facets. The chemical storage areas were designed in accordance with the Standard Building, Mechanical, and Gas Codes, as well as the National Electrical Code. The established maintenance program ensures that the equipment is maintained in a manner which allows its safe operation. Standard Opera"

      "SummaryText": "ting Procedures have been developed for the delivery of chlorine gas, operation of the chlorine feed system, management of change to processes, and the investigation and correction of leaks. Training programs have been implemented to ensure that employees have initial and ongoing training in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine gas system and proper response to an accidental release. This training not only includes plant personnel but also other personnel (e.g. Fire Department and contractors) who are instrumental to the overall success of the safety and emergency response programs. To ensure continued compliance with the conditions of the prevention program, periodic compliance audits are conducted and deficiencies addressed.\n\n\n\nAn emergency response plan is also in place. Trained plant personnel will address minor leaks (those contained on site, such as minor gasket leaks) while the Emergency Response Team of the City of Odessa Fire Department will address major leaks.  Leak detectors are in place that will alert plant personnel and Public Emergency Communications of a leak. Emergency Communications personnel will dispatch the Fire Department and notify key personnel. A simulated release and response exercise is practiced annually with emergency response personnel. If needed, the public in the affected area can be alerted through the Dialogic Communicator Corporation (DCC) or similar system. The Emergency Plan has also been coordinated with the Ector County Local Emergency Planning Group Public Communication.\n\n\n\nThe City conducts periodic evaluations of its hazardous gas systems. We ensure that the leak detenction system is maintained, ongoing training is provided, and Standard Operating Procedures reviewed and updated as needed. In summary, the City of Odessa has implemented a Risk Management Plan as defined by the Envionmental Protection Agency to address a potential release from its chlorine system operated at the Water Treatment Plant.
