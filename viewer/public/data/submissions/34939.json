If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of acetylene.   Acetylene is delivered in trailers contain a large number of cylinders manifolded together or manufactured by the addition of Calcium Carbide into water in a reactor vessel . A chemical reaction takes place and the acetylene is the compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, and the Alternative release, or more probable were all based on EPA?s Guidelines using ?RMP*Comp. (ver 1.07). The population results were based on the 2000 US Census datat obtained from ?Land View V? and actual observations.  The results can be reviewed by contacting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These  would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include a Deluge and fire suppression system,  check valves in the fill lines, Emergency Shut-off Valves , Flame Arrestors , vents, relief valves, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to preven"

Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process. \n \nWritten process safety information was developed for the acetylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of acetylene. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was review and updated in July 2003 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in July 2003 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.

Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed on July 2003.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in July 2003.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.

This program was review in July 2003.\n\nHazardous work or nonroutine work is controlled in a consistent manner.  The hazards identified is communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The BOC Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in July 2003 for both employees and contractors.\n \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.
