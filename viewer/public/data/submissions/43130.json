Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  The Walnut Energy Center is owned by the Walnut Energy Center Authority, a joint powers authority comprised of the Turlock Irrigation District and the Merced Irrigation District.  The Turlock Irrigation District is responsible for operating Walnut Energy Center.  As such, it takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as it takes controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps the Turlock Irrigation District takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Walnut Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nTurlock Irrigation District recognizes the responsibility to make its environment, community and employee safety a primary part of our daily concerns.  Turlock Irrigation District is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.

This document summarizes the Turlock Irrigation District?s existing health and safety programs, its internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment. The Walnut Energy Center Authority  has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Walnut Energy Center is a nominal 250-megawatt (MW), natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle generating facility consisting of two natural-gas-fired combustion turbines and one condensing steam turbine.  The Walnut Energy Center is owned by the Walnut Energy Center Authority and is operated by the Turlock Irrigation District.   The WEC is a high efficiency, combined-cycle facility that will be integrated into TID?s plans to meet its growing native load, and provide other ancillary services and benefits to TID.\n\nWEC is generally located at the western edge of the City of Turlock in Stanislaus County, California, approximately 2.7 miles west of Highway 99, just south of West Main Avenue, off South Washington Road. This site consists of approximately 18 acres within a 69-acre parcel of industrial zoned land. Industrial development exists on the north and east sides. Agricultural uses are located south of the site and agricultural, residential, and utility uses are to the west.  \n\nAmmonia is used at the Walnut Energy Center to reduce "

The anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nWalnut Energy Center is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements. Walnut Energy Center?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n?Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n?Performance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n?Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n?High level of training of the operators and maintenance staff.\n?Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of ammonia, and presence of ammonia detectors and alarms.\n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information\n\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazard, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of ammonia.

Such safety devices include secondary containment, leak detectors and alarms, pressure and level indication, emergency eye-wash and shower, a deluge system, and a vapor isolation valve.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 2005, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted for ammonia system equipment and procedures.  The PHA will be updated within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed during the 2005 PHA to improve the ammonia safety and staff is currently evaluating and implementing these recommendations, as appropriate.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nA seismic assessment of the ammonia process was conducted in June 2005 and recommendations were provided to Walnut Energy Center staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Turlock Irrigation District maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for ammonia process. The operating procedures include start-up, normal operation, and shutdown procedures.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of ammonia equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nWalnut Energy Center employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the ammonia process are trained in an overview of the process and detailed applicable operating and maintenance procedures.
