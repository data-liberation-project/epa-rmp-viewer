Univar supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil & gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome products stored and handled by Univar are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1.  Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA'S Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program.  Univar has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n?    Process Hazards Analysis\n?    Operating Procedures\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n?    Management of Change\n?    Incident Investigation\n?    Employee Participation\n?    Hot Work Permits\n?    Contractors\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in-place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to Univar facility personnel.  Univar responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incidents.\n\nUnivar invites and encourages local emergency responders such as the fire department to visit and familiarize themselves with our products and facilities.

      "SummaryText": "oint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Twinsburg Ohio site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers and municipalities in Ohio, NY and PA.  Prepackaged containers of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, formaldehyde (37%), ethylenediamine and hydrofluoric acid (70%) are handled at inventory levels above the RMP planning thresholds.  The typical inventory levels for these chemicals are:\n\n?    Chlorine - 100,000 lbs in 150# and ton cylinders,\n?    Sulfur dioxide - 18,000 lbs in 150# cylinders,\n?    Ammonia - 6750 lbs in 150# cylinders,\n?    Formaldehyde (37%) - 20,000 lbs in drums and intermediate bulk containers,\n?    Hydrofluoric acid (70%) 4000 lbs in drums.\n?    Ethylenediamine 24780 lbs in drums.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario for the site would involve a total ton cylinder failure with the release of 2000 lbs of chlorine, according to the EPA proscribed release protocol.  This would result in a release of 2000 lbs of chlorine in a 10 minute time period.  USEPA's RMP COMP air dispersion model projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 1.3 miles.    \n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nSix alternative release scenarios were developed for the site using EPA proscribed protocol and conducting air dispersion modeling with RMP COMP.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for chlorine would involve a 150 lb cylinder failure releasing 15 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide would involve a 150 lb cylinder failure releasing 15 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would involve a 150 lb cylinder failure releasing 15 lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of <0.1 mil"

Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for 37% formaldehyde would involve a partial container releasing 400 lbs of solution resulting in a release of 80 lbs/min of formaldehyde for a 5 minute time bperiod.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\n?    Alternative release scenario for ethylenediamine would involve a 413 lb drum leaking and releasing 40lbs/min for 10 minutes.  Modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Univar USA Inc. is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and utilizes this program to meet the prevention program requirements under RMP.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the following:\n1. The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2.  Employee training and operating procedures.\n3. Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4. Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Twinsburg site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the containerized storage of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn emergency contingency plan has been prepared and made available to local emergency response agencies.  The Twinsburg Fire Department is familiar with and periodically visits the site.  The site can utilize local emergency response contractors to provide onsite and offsite emergency response services in the event of a release."
