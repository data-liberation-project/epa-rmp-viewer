      "SummaryText": "     Inland Chemical Service Inc. is a fertilizer retail facility. The only material considered hazardous at this\nfacility is Anhydrous Ammonia. Our facility has one 18,000 gal tank, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and  \nequipment for transfering ammonia from storage to trucks. We have never had any accidents or releases with off-site  \nconsequences.\n     Safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include: 1. Pressure releif  \nvalves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank. 2. Excess flow valves to prevent flow  \nfrom the tank if any anhydrous line or hose breaks. To further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees  \nare trained in proceedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance  \nprocedures. We have coordinated with the Condon Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.  \nWe have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This is the release of the entire contents of  \nthe storage tank. According to information supplied by the EPA the zone of concern from this scenario would extend  \n5.1 miles from our tank, and would include the city of Condon. It is unlikely that an event such as this will ever  \noccur. A more probable, but still unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  \nAccording to information supplied by the EPA, the zone of concern from such a release would only extend 2000 feet  \nand would not include any residences, hospitals, schools, or commercials areas."
