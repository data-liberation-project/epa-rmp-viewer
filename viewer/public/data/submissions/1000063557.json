This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex is located at 129010 Hatcherville Road, Baytown, Texas in Chambers County.\n\n\n\nThe Propane Dehydrogenation Unit receives liquid propane feed stock which is then vaporized and sent to the Catofin Reactors where it is partially converted to propylene and hydrogen along with additional by-products.  The mixed stream is then sent first through a deethanizer to recover the lighter products and then through a splitter to recover the propylene.  The propane is recycled into the feed stock and the by-products sent to the Mont Belvieu Main Complex for further processing.  Two refrigeration systems are used in the recovery process, one using propylene as a refrigerant and the other using ethylene.  Feed stock and products are transported to and from the facility via pipeline.  Ethylene refrigerant can be delivered via pipeline or truck.\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  \n\n\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\n\n\n\n"

The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA's PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
