These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nGoldscmidt Chemical, a subsidiary of Degussa Corporation, produces surfactants at the Janesville plant.  As defined by the regulations, the Janesville plant stores the following toxic chemicals in excess of the threshold quantities: ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and methyl chloride.\n\nThe Degussa Goldschmidt Janesville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Goldschmidt's written environmental health and safety policy states that the corporation is committed to preserve health, safety and a sound environment for our employees, community and customers.  The Degussa Goldschmidt Janesville plant has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous chemicals.  In the unlikely event of a release, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Degussa Goldschmidt Janesville plant is a derivatives-producing facility located at 900 South Palm Street in Janesville, Wisconsin.  The plant is situated on approximately 25 acres on the south side of Janesville in Rock County.  Residential property to the north, Panoramic Packaging, Inc. to the east, farmland to the west, and the Rock River to the south occupy the immediate area surrounding the"

The plant manufactures a variety of fatty nitrogen derivatives using batch reactor processing involving alkylation, amidation, alkoxylation, esterification, and oxidation of fatty amines, short-chain amines, fat and vegetable oils and acids, alcohols, and glycols.  The products are used by manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric softeners, and various health and personal care products, primarily for household consumer usage.  The facility employs approximately 80 employees and is operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Janesville plant maintains a rigorous Process Safety Management program, which satisfies all applicable requirements of both OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Rule 40 CFR 68.  The facility maintains policies and programs that address required program elements as follows:\n\nEmployee Participation: The facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention programs.  Examples include participation in Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), operating procedure development, injury and/or incident investigations, unsafe act and/or condition reporting, safety committee meetings, plant safety meetings, pre-manufacturing meetings, management of change reviews, etc.  \n\nProcess Safety Information: Process safety information is compiled prior to beginning any PHA or PHA revalidation effort to assure proper documentation is available for the review team's utilization during the PHA process.  Process safety information is kept evergreen through the utilization of the management of change process as well as periodic internal and corporate audit verifications.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: The facility maintains a procedure to assure PHAs and PHA revalidations are conducted within prescribed timeframes.  A management system is"

Annual reviews are conducted as required.  Operating procedures are reviewed and updated as required by the management of change process and through suggestions made by operators.\n\nTraining: The facility maintains a written and walkthrough training program for operations, maintenance, and distribution personnel.  Facility personnel undergo training on OSHA, EPA, and DOT required subjects on an ongoing basis.  Operations and maintenance personnel have received both PSM overview training as well as specific process hazards overview training.  Refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\n\nContractors: The facility maintains a contractor qualification program which meets all OSHA and EPA requirements.  Contractors receive hazard identification training prior to commencement of work and are monitored by the internal auditing program to assure compliance with all OSHA, EPA, and Degussa standards.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews: The facility maintains an active program to perform pre-startup safety reviews on all changes to assure that all phases of the change have been installed correctly, personnel have been trained as required, and maintenance procedures are in place to safely maintain the equipment.\n\nMechanical Integrity: The facility maintains an extensive mechanical integrity program that covers not only PSM and RMP covered equipment but also other equipment at the site.  Routine maintenance procedures are in place for critical equipment and tests required complying with PSM and RMP, following manufacturer recommendations.\n\nSafe Work Practices: The facility maintains safe work practice policies which govern Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, and Line Breaking, whic"
