      "SummaryText": "J.R. Simplot's Aberdeen Processing Plant has a large refrigeration system to quickly freeze and store the potato products that it produces.  The system has a computerized process control system that monitors system performance and  controls its operation.\n\nAmmonia is used as a refrigerant in this system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. It is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public, and the environment, the Aberdeen Processing Plant has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.  The Plant Maintenance/Engineering Manager is responsible for overall management of this program.  It is designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM found in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at J.R. Simplot Aberdeen Processing Plant.\n\nThe Simplot Aberdeen plant has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected.  The plant maintains a group of maintenance personnel who are trained and qualified to respond to leaks of ammonia.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Aberdeen police and fire departments, and the Bingham County Disaster, Services Coordinator to assist in the response.

      "SummaryText": " and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\nThe Aberdeen plant has experienced only infrequent minor releases that have never been detected beyond the plant boundaries.  During the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\n\nAs a result of a recent revalidation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the ammonia refrigeration system, an already comprehensive operating and maintenance procedure system is being expanded for clarity and for an enhanced training system for these procedures.  This system will provide a consistent dialogue between refrigeration system operators and management in order to ensure procedural accuracy and more consistent training frequency.  As a result of said PHA studies, the compressor room ammonia sensors have been placed on a regular calibration schedule.  Wind socks have been installed at various locations so that they can be seen from any outdoor location at the plant.  If a release occurs, this will enable employees to quickly determine the wind direction during a release and to assemble in a pre-designated assemble location.  It will also provide a quick indication of whether the toxic cloud is traveling toward the populated area in Aberdeen."
