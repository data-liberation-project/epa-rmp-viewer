As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Famous Vineyards has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Famous Vineyards, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Famous Vineyards has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nP1 Old Cold Storage          Anhydrous Ammonia                19,000\r\nP2 New Cold Storage          Anhydrous Ammonia                120,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

In each system, high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers are piped to multiple accumulators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator either feeds a hydrocooler, multiple bunker mounted or ceiling suspended evaporator coils located throughout the facility. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulators. For Process 2, any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receivers as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulators, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped t"

The vapor is then sent to the evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. Process 2 is also equipped with a thermosyphon vessel located between the evaporative condensers and high pressure receiver. The thermosyphon vessel supplies the screw compressor oil coolers with small amounts of high pressure liquid. As this liquid absorbs the heat from the oil, it evaporates inside the oil cooler, and returns to the thermosyphon vessel.\r\n \r\nSafety Systems \r\n\r\nThere are five (5) ammonia detection monitors installed at Sun Pacific Famous Vineyards. Each monitor is connected to multiple ammonia detectors installed in the rooms where ammonia provides refrigeration. The detection system is interlocked with the refrigeration system controls as follows:\r\n\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds the set ppm, an audible alarm will be initiated throughout the facility, and a visual alarm will be initiated inside the electrical room above the ammonia detector monitors.\r\n\r\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds the set ppm, the emergency ventilation systems in the machinery rooms will be activated.\r\nThe ammonia detection monitors provide ammonia detection as summarized below:\r\n\r\nProcess 1 - Old Cold Storage\r\nMonitor #1\r\nRooms 1-8\r\nHallway\r\nMonitor #2\r\nMachinery Room\r\nPrecool 7\r\n\r\nProcess 2 - New Cold Storage\r\nMonitor #1\r\nMachinery Room"
