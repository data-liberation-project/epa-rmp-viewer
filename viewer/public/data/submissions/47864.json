              "Description": "Ammonia Storage and Loading (6000)\nThe Prevention Program ensures that toxic and flammable substances are safely handled and that releases are detected and mitigated.  DGC applied the concepts of a successful on-site health and safety program to potential off-site consequences and protection of the public and environment.  The Prevention Program includes the procedures and programs in place to address the twelve elements of the Process Safety Management Prevention Standard.  This program integrates safety elements including design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Synfuels Plant.  The Synfuels Plant has complied with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\nThe main focus of the Prevention Program is reducing the likelihood of a release.  Procedures are in place to provide well-maintained equipment and well-trained staff and contractors along with design and process control systems to reduce the likelihood of a release.\n\nOne of the most important Prevention Program elements for ammonia handling areas is mechanical integrity.  The following elements are accomplished to prevent releases:\n\n- Peridoic walk-throughs in process areas to find vibrations, leaks, and potential failure points\n- Inspection, testing, and maintenance of process, storage, and pressure vessels on a routine schedule\n- Periodic replacement or preventive inspection and maintenance of pressure relief valves\n- Periodic inspection of process control instruments that have safety implications\n- Periodic inspection of major powered and rotating equipment for mechanical failure\n- Review of needed spare parts\n- Identification of critical process valves\n\nThe Synfuels Plant uses applicable codes, standards, and equipment history to establish an effective testing and inspection frequency.\n\nThe Synfuels Plant has a Quality Assurance Program to ensure the proper material of construction, fabrication, and inspection procedures are followed for new construction or management of change implementation.  Inspections, testing, and preventive maintenance of pressure vessels or piping systems are at established frequency based on industry standards or equipment history.  Inspection and testing of pressure relief valves are also at an established frequency.  The Synfuels Plant has established a covered process list for equipment, piping systems, electrical/instrumentation components, relief and vent systems, and fire protection systems.\n\nThe process hazards, process controls in use, mitigation systems in use, and monitoring/detection systems in use have been reviewed for each process area handling ammonia and are documented in the PHA and summarized in the RMP.\n\nA management system with overall responsibility for developing, implementing, and integrating the Risk Management Program requirements including the Prevention Program has been developed.\n\nDGC is committed to continually reduce risk, and programs are in place to manage the risks and provide continuous improvement.",

Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Synfuels Plant has a good record of preventing significant accidental releases over the last five years, reflecting the good safety at the facility.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only twelve reportable accidental releases as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred in the last five years.  The twelve accidents resulted in relatively small injuries, and none of them resulted in off-site impacts.  Since there was not an off-site impact, the Emergency Response Program for off-site notification was not required or invoked.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Synfuels Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including response to and mitigation for fires, explosion, hazardous and gas releases; adequate first aid and medical treatment; evacuations; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public; as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nPotential off-site impacts are addressed through an in-place Emergency Response Plan to deal with the PSM and DGC health, safety, and environmental policies.  In case of an off-site release impact, DGC is responsible for notifying residents and businesses downwind out to 4 1/2 miles from the plant.  The notification will be done by using the computerized 911 out-calling system.  Mercer County Emergency Services will notify residents beyond 4 1/2 miles.

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCritical valves for the 1400, 4400, and 6000 plant operation ammonia refrigeration system were identified in March of 2004.  The valves were identified using the following criteria:  any valve, which if operated incorrectly alone or in conjunction with others could cause personal injury, equipment loss, a release of ammonia, or any valve that is not routinely used and must have refresher training before use.  Critical valve labeling will be completed by September 2004.\n\nBefore EPA adopted the new RMP regulation, DGC took proactive steps upon initial ownership to ensure worker safety and protection of the public and environment by implementing policies concerning health, safety, and environment.  The existing DGC Emergency Response Plan was modified to conform with the requirements of Section 112? of the CAAA.  Changes to the existing Emergency Response Plan primarily involved performing a new Hazard Assessment and putting the existing Emergency Response Program and OSHA Process Safety Mangement Program into Section 112? format.
