Five-year Accident History\nDPC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases from this facility during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\nDPC carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Sarpy County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our \nemergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6.

(DPC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \nUnforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies.  Safety is an essential part of our operations, the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDPC whose primary activities encompass distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment products. For example, chlorine is used to produce sodium hypochlorite commonly know as household bleach.\n \nDPC handles Anhydrous Ammonia, Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) for use by our customers.\n\n3.  The Process Safety Management Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist (combined).  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years as required or as necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, DPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDPC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at DPC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDPC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDPC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
