      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview:  The Blawnox Distribution Center in Blawnox, Pennsylvania is a distribution center for laboratory equipment, apparatuses, and laboratory-grade chemicals.  The facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act Amendments due to onsite storage capacities of chloroform.  At the time of the submittal, the facility had approximately 15,450 pounds of chloroform.  The amount of chloroform differs from the quantity reported in Section 1.17 of this document; the amount in Section 1.17 is the threshold quantity of the chemical.  The facility predictively filed for chloroform in the event that the quantity of this material stored on site exceeds the threshold quantities.  Chemical storage is the only regulated process at the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  The facility's overall approach and committment to proper chemical management is demonstrated by training, procedures, and maintenance systems currently in place at the facility.  The facility is committed to ensuring safe operations in accordance with Part 68 requirements and has established a senior manager responsible for Part 68 implementation and compliance.  \n\nRelease Scenarios:  A worst-case scenario was conducted for chloroform for the single largest vessel based on US EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance and EPA-approved modeling.  The worst-case release scenario for chloroform consisted of a liquid spill and vaporization.  The largest container size of chloroform was 200 liters.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chloroform was 0.03 miles.  The worst-case scenario did not result in an impact to the public or environmental receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:  New employees are trained on chemical handling and release prevention during the orientation process.  Existing employees receive refresher training on proper chemical handling, proper loading and unloading of che"

The facility has also coordinated response efforts with the Guyasuta Fire Department to ensure that the Department will respond to accidental releases from the storage process as necessary.  A notification mechanism has been established to ensure that the Guyasuta Fire Department will be properly notified when response is required for a release.  The facility submitted copies of its SARA 302, 311, and 312 reports to the Guyasuta Fire Department.  The Blawnox Distribution Center is subject to emergency response plan requirements including 29 CFR 1910.38.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Periodic reviews of the program, training, and maintenance procedures are conducted to ensure that any necessary and appropriate changes are made to maintain and improve safety.  \n\nSummary:  As documented in this submittal, the facility has met Part 68 requirements and has certified compliance."
