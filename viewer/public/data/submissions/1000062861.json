Gas from the outlet of the Robinson Lake Gas Plant is routed to the inlet of the Stanley Booster Station for further processing, where the pressure is boosted from 700 pounds per square inch, gauge (psig) to 2,000 psig before transferring the gas to various sales outlets. The Stanley Booster Station includes four natural gas-fired compressor engines, a line heater, inlet and utility gas scrubbers, a Joule-Thomson (JT) expansion valve processing skid, and an emergency generator, as well as storage tanks and other equipment to support operation of the station The Stanley Booster Station is permitted to operate under North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) Permit Number O12008-R1.\n\n \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program an"
