      "SummaryText": "Introduction \n\n\n\nThe Castaic Lake Water Agency (CLWA) Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant (RVWTP) uses chlorine, a regulated chemical, for disinfection. This Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was originally submitted in June 1999 and revised in June 2004 and December 2008. The plant was expanded between 2009 and 2011. The expansion project included the construction of a new chlorine building and an increase in the maximum inventory of chlorine from 16 to 33 one-ton cylinders. The RMP is summarized below.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe CLWA RVWTP is located at 27234 Bouquet Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, California and covers 65 acres. RVWTP is provided State Project water stored in Castaic Lake for treatment and distribution. The plant is currently capable of treating 60 million gallons per day (mgd) of water with an additional future capacity of 120 mgd.\n\nRaw water is first delivered to the pre-ozone contactor where ozone is applied for pre-oxidation and pre-disinfection. Ozonated water then enters the rapid mix structure where coagulants are added. The water is then fed to up-flow clarifiers, and then to a gravity filtration system. In the final stage, filtered water is disinfected with chlorine, monitored for chlorine residual, dosed with ammonia to create chloramines and released to CLWA's transmission system for distribution. Potentially hazardous chemicals that are stored and used onsite include chlorine, aqueous ammonia (19%), hydrogen peroxide, diesel fuel, liquefied oxygen, ferric chloride and sodium hydroxide. Gaseous chlorine, used for disinfection of water, is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum chlorine storage capacity in the new chlorine building at the plant is currently 33 cylinders (66,000 pounds). Space for two additional scales and 20 additional one-ton chlorine cylinders is available. Chlorine is no longer stored in the former chlorine building.\n\n \n\n\n\nChemicals Subject to USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention "

      "SummaryText": "Program (CalARP) and Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nCLWA uses chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5) at the RVWTP in quantities large enough to trigger the USEPA RMP and CalARP, a state mandated accidental chemical release prevention program. The USEPA RMP threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds. The CalARP threshold quantity for chlorine is 100 pounds. The current maximum storage capacity is\n\n33 one-ton cylinders (66,000 pounds). The CLWA RVWTP is also subject to OSHA PSM regulations for all equipment and operations associated with chlorine storage and disinfection systems. The threshold quantity under PSM for chlorine is 1,500 pounds. The Federal RMP and CalARP rule define three program levels based on the processes' relative potential for public impacts, the level of effort needed to prevent accidents and coverage by other regulations. At the RVWTP, public receptors are located within the distance to an endpoint concentration and the facility is subject to the PSM standard; therefore, the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements. The remaining chemicals stored at the facility are either addressed in a separate RMP\n\n(i.e., aqueous ammonia), or not covered under the RMP, CalARP or PSM programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Releases during Past Five Years\n\n\n\nThe CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management Accident Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe CLWA Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with its chlorine system. The CLWA's PSM programs include the following activities to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\n\n\n* Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to establish they are properly designed and installed.\n\n\n\n* Updating of standard operating "

The Safety Officer maintains the CCCP. The key elements of CLWA's emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n\n?    The plant uses a combination of audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\n\n?    In the unlikely event of an uncontrollable accidental release, the facility would immediately contact the Los Angeles County Fire Department and evacuate to designated staging areas.\n\n \n\nCLWA's Recent Steps to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBased on CLWA's dedication to process safety and the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) r"
