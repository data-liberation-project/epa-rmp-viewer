The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, opearation, and maintenance of covered process.  Sunkist's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, in the event of a release, Sunkist's personnel are trained to shutoff the release if possible.  Sunkit's emergency response protocols identify local, state and federal agencies to be contacted in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe prevention program includes the following areas:  employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor evaluation, cotnractors and visitor orientation, prestart up review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response,  and compliance audits.\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia  refrigeration system designed to provide refrigeration to a tank room housing (6) 1 million gallon aseptic juice tanks.  The covered process utilizes 15,266 pounds of anhydrous ammonia."
