Flexible Foam receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  \r\n\r\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA's Risk Management Rule.\r\n\r\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the 1205 Prudential Boulevard facility in tank trucks and rail cars.  The trucks and rail cars are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building, the probability of release of toluene diisocyanate vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no inhabited receptors (buildings and people other than the Flexible facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored or unloaded toluene diisocyanate but undeveloped and uninhabited property beyond the property line to the East and South would be impacted by a worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nBecause there are no public receptors and there have been no significant incidents or releases in the last five years (it is a new facility), Flexible Foam, 1205 Prudential Boulevard facility is classified as a \"Program 1\" facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n WORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nDELETED in Accordance with 4/19/2004 Rulemaking.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\r\n\r\nFlexible Foam, Inc. takes safety very seriously.  We use safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of any release that might occur.  Some examples are:\r\n\r\n\t-Regular equipment inspections and maintenance to ensure proper"

( Flexible Foam) plant in Longview, WA, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Longview, WA plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled"

      "SummaryText": "The primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and one rail car) at our plant is about 400,000 lb.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\r\n\r\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA\u00bfs risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios:\r\n\r\nDELETED in Accordance with 4/19/2004 Rulemaking.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA\u00bfs Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule, which specifies that we notify and coordinate with local emergency planning agencies.\r\n\r\nWe have coordinated with Liquid Waste Removal (contracted professional emergency response firm) and the Prentiss County Development Commission.\r\n\r\nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and management system failures.\r\n \r\nIn addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain or control a release, and (3) reduc"
