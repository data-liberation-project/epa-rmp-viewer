      "SummaryText": "The facility has one PS/RM applicable process - the receipt, storage, and conveyance of isopentane.  Isopentane is used in the Expandable Polystyrene Bead (EPS) manufacturing line where it is injected as a raw material during the extrusion process.  This process utilizing isopentane was identified as highly hazardous because it meets regulatory requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management (RM) Program for Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR 68.  The total amount of pentane stored onsite exceeds the regulated OSHA and EPA threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe Management of Change procedure is used for determining new highly hazardous processes at the facility.  The procedure is described in detail in Section 11 of the manual, which is maintained onsite.  \n\nISI is dedicated to protecting employees, the community, and the environment from highly hazardous incidents through safely operating our facility.  To ensure efficient and effective management of our operations, we have developed the Process Safety/Risk Management (PS/RM) Manual.  The Manual provides the facility with a systematic and integrated approach to evaluating, implementing, and continuously improving PS/RM.  The manual addresses how the various ongoing activities (i.e., process design and maintenance, training, control of contractors, operating procedures, emergency response planning) that impact highly hazardous processes are implemented.  This approach also ensures the participation of management and staff.\n\n"
