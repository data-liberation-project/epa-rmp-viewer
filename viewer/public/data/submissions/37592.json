Temperatures range from -20 F to +30 F with a 45 F dock\nand 22 dock doors.\n\n      Ammonia is the refrigerant used in the refrigeration system. Ammonia safety is what this summary is about.\nAmmonia is an extremely hazardous substance that has been used in refrigeration since the late 1800.\nWhen ammonia systems are designed properly, maintained properly and maintained by qualified personnel they\nare extremely safe. As a good nieghbor we want to exhibit to you that Arctic Cold Storage follows the important \nguidelines.\n\n      System design follows or exceeds codes set by the state of Michigan. We also follow guidelines set by the\nIIAR. For example it is not required by code that the ventilation system can be started from a remote location \noutside the compressor room. IIAR recommends this, so we do. Emergency shutdown can also be done from off\nsite by computer. The entire system is monitored by computer with a repetitive callout system to plant personnel\nwhen there is an alarm or failure. Remember that an alarm or failure does not mean a ammonia release. It only\nmeans that a safety in tha system has worked.\n\n      Some 100,000 ammonia refrigeration plants are operating in countries around the world. Man is producing\napproximatley 120,000,000 tons of ammonia yearly for use as fertilizers and for the chemical industry etc., which\naccounts for some 98% of all the ammonia used. The remainder is involved in refrigeration applications. The\nref"

There has been no releases other than normal maintenance pumpdowns and no additional ammonia \nbrought in. There have been no ammonia related accidents at ACS.\n\n       In the event of a accidental release, that could have offsite site consequences it is the policy of ACS that\nemergency shutdown takes place, calls are made to the LEPC, Fire Department and that all employees are\nevacuated to emergency assembly areas. Only trained personnel will respond to the leak. Emergency shutdown\nstops all compressors all pumps and all selonoid valves go to the closed position. All this can be done with one \nswitch in the General Managers office. Since all compressing of ammonia gas is stopped and pumping of \nliquid ammonia is stopped a serious leak is miminized. The alternative scenario is somethig more realistic. This \nscenario would propally happen in the compressor room and would go as follows.  A seal fails on a pump or \ncompressor or a worker makes a mistake while performing maintenance. There are steps to prevent these kind of \naccident. Basic preventive maintenance and training are the keys. Seals rarely fail without giving the operator \nnotice, oil on the floor, the smell of ammonia that wasn't there the day before, tells the operator that steps need\nto be taken. Since ammonia is detectable at levels as low as 3 to 5 parts per million small leaks can be found and\nrepaired before they become serious. ACS has a no leak is tolerable policy. A review of the task to be done is the\nfisrt step. What drawings do we need to look at? How do we get all the ammonia out of the system that needs to \nbe opened? What valves need to be closed? Is the safety equipment there if something unexpected happens?\nMost ammonia releases at refrigerated warehouses happen while the system was either being added on to or \nmaintenance was being done.

The penthouse evaporators cannot \nbe reached by fork lifts. Dock evaporators are over racks putting them out of the path of fork lifts. We are required \nby OSHA to to have a process management program in place and it must be followed.This is not a burden to ACS \nbut a helpful tool to help us keep our equipment running, and our employees safe.\n\n       As the chief engineer at ACS I hold a first class refrigeration operators license from the city of Detroit. I have\nheld this license for 25 years. It qualifies me to operate a refrigeration system of unlimited HP and unlimited lbs.\nof refrigerant. I have also attended several classes at the University of Wisconsin on the design and construction\nof freezers, coolers and process rooms, ammonia refrigeration system safety and classes at the manufactures\nplant of our refrigeration equipment. ACS also employees a assistant engineer who is also a licensed operator.\n\n      I would like to close this summary with a brief review of ACS. This is not a process facility where we are taking\nammonia in running it through a process, mixing it with other products to make a new product and sending it back out.\nThe ammonia in this plant is the same ammonia that was put in here in 1994. Using the same basic principles that\nthe home refrigerator uses, evaporating the liquid to a vapor cools our building, compressing the vapor and \ncondensing it back to a liquid to be evaporated again, over and over the process goes day in and day out. There \nhave been no accidental releases, no ammonia related injuries. We are also going to explore new mitigation devices \nthat help to control a worst case scenario.
