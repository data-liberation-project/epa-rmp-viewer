Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Opal Gas Plant is coordinated with the Lincoln County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Opal Gas Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Lincoln County LEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Lincoln County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIn response to the most recent accident, the Opal Gas Plant has re-evaluated all elements of process safety.  The local leadership team has recommitted to assessment of additional engineering safeguards and continuous improved training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances.\n\n"
