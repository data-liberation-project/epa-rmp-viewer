Emergency assembly area locations are to the north of the facility, and are discussed in the same section of the Emergency Response Plan and Procedures. The Emergency Response Team and area supervisors are the responsible parties for ensuring all employees are evacuated safely. They are also responsible for ensuring all employees evacuate to the designated rendezvous point.\r\n\r\nNotification of evacuation will be provided in the form of an emergency whistle, or disaster alarm. Three (3) short blasts of the disaster alarm, followed by a pause, followed by three more short blasts will signify work area evacuation. The emergency coordinator is responsible for sounding the disaster alarm.\r\n\r\nIn the event the emergency coordinator is unavailable, the emergency coordinator alternate will become responsible for sounding the disaster alarm.

The Turlock Cold Storage facility is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4.

Senior management as well as Safety Coordinators administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \r\n\r\nTurlock Cold Storage has coordinated emergency response efforts with Stanislaus County. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Turlock Cold Storage to evacuate employees and to notify the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. Facility refrigeration operators will be available for guidance and assistance.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room. The system is a closed loop refrigeration system, similar to a residential refrigerator.

In addition, there have been no releases meeting the accident criteria described above or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tsave lives;\r\n\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\r\n\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\r\n\u00bf\tminimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.
