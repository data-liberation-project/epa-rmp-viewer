Senior management as well as Safety Coordinators administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nTurlock Cold Storage has coordinated emergency response efforts with Stanislaus County. In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Turlock Cold Storage to evacuate employees and to notify the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. Facility refrigeration operators will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room. The system is a closed loop refrigeration system, similar to a residential refrigerator. There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Turlock Cold Storage facility is located at 107 South Kilroy Road in Turlock, California.  The facility is approximately 0.2 miles west of State Highway 99, situated at the southwest corner of the intersection created by South Kilroy and West Main Street. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with commercial areas.  \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Turlock Cold Storage is to provide refrigeration for cold and freezer storage of food products.

The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the storage of various food products.  Typical operating conditions range from 0 psig on the low pressure side of the system, 5 psig on the intermediate side, to 135 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the Cal-OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures: The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. Turlock Cold Storage facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation. It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.

On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study (April 23, 2014), there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (April 2009 - April 2014). In addition, there have been no releases meeting the accident criteria described above or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.

The Plant Manager and/or Chief Engineer will immediately determine the quantity of the release and, if deemed necessary, notify the appropriate authorities and agencies. They will also determine whether the system requires shut down.\n\n\n\nIf evacuation of the facility is necessary, plant personnel will vacate the facility according to evacuation routes outlined in Section15 of the Sierra Pacific Emergency Response Plan and Procedures. Emergency assembly area locations are to the north of the facility, and are discussed in the same section of the Emergency Response Plan and Procedures. The Emergency Response Team and area supervisors are the responsible parties for ensuring all employees are evacuated safely. They are also responsible for ensuring all employees evacuate to the designated rendezvous point.\n\n\n\nNotification of evacuation will be provided in the form of an emergency whistle, or \"disaster alarm\". Three (3) short blasts of the disaster alarm, followed by a pause, followed by three more short blasts will signify work area evacuation. The emergency coordinator is responsible for sounding the disaster alarm.\n\n\n\nIn the event the emergency coordinator is unavailable, the emergency coordinator alternate will become responsible for sounding the disaster alarm. If evacuation of the entire facility is necessary, designated emergency action personnel will coordinate the movement of employees to the appropriate assembly area or rendezvous point. Emergency response drills involving all facility personnel are performed on an annual basis. This ensures that employees are familiar with evacuation routes from the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation was conducted on April 23rd, 2014.
