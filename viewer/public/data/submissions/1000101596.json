With respect to the community outside of StanChem, StanChem is also committed to communicating with and maintaining awareness by all concerned persons regarding the Company's commitment to environmental, health and safety principles.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nStanChem has three divisions:\n1)  The Specialty Coating division, which manufactures a diverse group of plastisols, specialty adhesives, printing inks, pigmented dispersions and high performance coatings;\n2)  The Albi division, which is a pioneer in the fire-protective coating industry, and continues to be a leading manufacturer of innovative, high-performance fire-retardant and fire-resistant coatings; and\n3)  The Polymer division, which manufactures a broad line of polymers for a variety of industries including paint, paper, adhesive and building products.\n\nStanChem currently uses two regulated substances subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  The substances are Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) and Acrylonitrile (ACN).  \nVAM is used in the majority of polymer products.  VAM is stored on site in one 20,000 and two 6,000 gallon tanks.  The tanks are equipped with level indicators, and audible and visible high-level alarms.  The 20,000 gallon tank is located within concrete secondary containment and the two 6,000 gallon tanks are double-walled.  \n\nACN is stored on site in a 5,000 gallon storage tank. The tank is equipped with level indicators, and audible and visible high-level alarms.  The storage tank is located in an unoccupied building area (i.e. enclosure building).  The enclosure where the tank is located is equipped with a lower explosive limit (L"

Signs are posted outside of the enclosure indicating it is an unoccupied area with air monitoring required before entering and appropriate PPE donned prior to entering the unoccupied area.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nStanChem's accidental release prevention program includes safeguards and controls to prevent or limit the effects of an incident such as the worst-case scenarios discussed above.  \nWith regard to unloading of VAM into the facility's storage tanks, these safeguards and controls include, but are not limited to:  a vapor recovery system to direct monomer vapors back into the tanker truck; an emergency recovery tank under the unloading pad to trap dripped or spilled monomer; secondary containment dike around the tank; multiple high-level alarms on the tanks; and a scrubber or thermal incinerator treatment system to control vapors from potential excess pressure in the tank during loading.  \n\nSafeguards and controls for the pumping of VAM from the storage tanks to pre-emulsion tanks and subsequently to polymerization reactors include:  equipment grounding and bonding; automated material delivery and cut-off valves; pressure and temperature monitors and alarms; and check valves.  Rupture disks and treatment of displaced fumes through the scrubber or thermal incinerator serve as safeguards and controls on monomers being released from the reactors.  Other controls for the polymerization process include:  automatic and manual shut-offs; back-up pump; and a purge system to promote consistent and complete polymerization.   \n\nStanChem has developed a transfer procedure incorporating several safeguards for unloading of ACN from the delivery truck into the storage tank.  Connections between the truck and the hose are dry lock fittings.  The hose connections are monitored with a gas meter during the unloading activity.  Containment is established under"

      "SummaryText": "the truck transfer connection and a neutralization spray is available.  Transfers are completed by trained personnel.  The transfer procedures include details on required PPE, unloading procedure, and checklist. Connections between the truck and the hose are unique sized fitting which cannot be connected to other lines.  The transfer hoses are steel braided with flexible compatible internal hose.  The transfer procedure specifies inspection of the hose prior to transfer and that they be replaced every 5 years.  The transfer line from pump to tank is equipped with a backflow prevention device (check valve).  The high pressure identified by tank pressure gauge will cause the pump to stop and closes pressure relief valves on transfer line and tank vent.\n\nStanChem has developed transfer procedures incorporating several safeguards for transferring ACN from the storage tank into the pre-emulsion tanks.  The procedures for transfer operations include verification of proper configuration of manual valves.  Operators are prompted to inspect valve positions before transfer.  Pre-emulsion recipes are pre-programmed to allow automation rather than operator having to specify acrylonitrile volumes.  Excess flow of ACN to pre-emulsion tanks is detected from reconciliation between flow meter and tank weight.  Transfer of ACN to the wrong pre-emulsion tank is prevented by system valve configurations which only allow charging to the intended tank with valve lines to the other tanks auto-closed.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nStanChem has had no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nStanChem has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department, police department, area hospital, utility companies, and StanChem\u0092s emergency response contractor to handle a potential emergency at the facility and related communications to the public.  StanChem personnel have been trained in accordance with federal and state environmental an"

StanChem may also install a new modern reactor train (Reactor 5), improved truck transfer area, and additional storage tanks with new design safety features."
