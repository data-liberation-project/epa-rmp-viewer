Employees of the facility are trained in their roles and responsibilities in implementing prevention and emergency response.  Should an emergency occur, it is the company's policy to notify the City of Chester Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.\r\n2.\tStationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nAqueous ammonia is stored in a bulk tank at the facility.  The facility is a commercial emulsion and dispersant manufacturing facility.\r\n3.\tThe worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including the administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for release have been prepared and submitted as required.  This data may be viewed onsite.  \r\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThe design, installation and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia tank is performed in conformance with ANSI standards, state and local regulations.  Facility personnel have been trained in safe handling procedures of the chemical.  The facility is in compliance with the applicable regulations.  The loading of aqueous ammonia is conducted with extreme safety.  All the transfer operations are monitored and follow a written standard operating procedure (SOP).\r\n5.\tThe five-year accident history:\r\nNone.\r\n6.\tThe emergency response program:\r\nIn the event of an emergency, the facility will immediately notify the City of Chester Fire Department for emergency response measures.\r\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:"
