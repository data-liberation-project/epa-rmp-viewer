This release did not result in any on-site or off-site death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  This is the only incident involving chlorine release in the past 15 years and does not qualify as a reportable release as defined by 40 CFR 68.42 (a).\n\nThe Marion Wastewater Treatment Facility has an Emergency Action Plan, which has been coordinated with the City of Marion Fire Department.  In the event of a leak, the plan requires that the individual, having discovered the leak, remove themselves from the effected area and immediately report the condition to his/her supervisor.  Each employee is trained to be aware of potentially dangerous conditions.\n\nThe supervisor will initiate the alarm for evacuation and will attempt to notify other department supervisors as to the nature of the alarm.  The supervisor will then notify the fire department of the emergency condition.  Each department supervisor will be responsible to observe the windsock on top of the chlorine storage building and determine the best evacuation route as specified in the Emergency Action Plan.  Employees unable to communicate with thier supervisor should observe the windsock and follow an evacuation route upwind.  Evacuation route maps are posted in several notable areas throughout the facility.\n\nIf an alarm sounds during weekday shifts, each employee should stop work activities, shut down equipment, wear clothing appropriate for the weather conditions, and assemble at their supervisor's office.  If an employee can not reach the supervisor's office, he/she should observe the windsock and choose an evacuation route upwind.\n\nThe Marion Fire Department will be responsible for rescues as required.

      "SummaryText": "The City of Marion Wastewater Treatment Facility is a 12.0 MGD conventional activated sludge facility with single stage nitrification, phosphorus removal, and anaerobic digestion.  Disinfection is by chlorination followed by de-chlorination.  Specific processes incorporate the use of certain regulated substances.  The disinfection process utilitzes chlorine, followed by sulfur dioxide addition for de-chlorination.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 5,000 lbs.  However, there can not be more than 4000 lbs in use at one time.  The maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide is 900 lbs.  A by-product of anaerobic digestion is the production of methane, and other gases, commonly known as digester gas.  Digester gas is collected and stored for use as fuel to power pumps, blowers, and heating systems.  The maximum storage capacity for digester gas is 47,710 cubic feet, or 1,891 lbs.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine exceeds the EPA Threshold Quantity (TQ) of 2,500 lbs.  Therefore, the Marion Wastewater Treatment Facility must develop and implement a Risk Management Plan, in compliance with 40 CFR part 68.  The inventories of other regulated substances do not exceed the TQs for those substances and are not included as a part of the plan.\n\nFacility personnel will follow routine maintenance procedures in making required repairs, in the event of a minor chlorine leak.  If the leak is significant, the City of Marion Fire Department will be contacted to respond, per the facility Emergency Action Plan.\n\nA large leak, developing in a full one ton cylinder stored outside of the chlorination building would be considered a worst case scenario.  All of the contents of the cylinder would be released as a toxic gas within the span of approximately ten minutes.  There are no passive mitigation measures in this case.  Under worst case weather conditions, the chlorine would travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\n\nThe Acci"

      "SummaryText": "dent Release Prevention Program is, in effect, the OSHA Process Safety Management Program and the USEPA Risk Managment Program.\n\nOne of the key safety features of the chlorination process is the piping system.  This system operates under a vacuum condition, preventing accidental release of chlorine gas into the atmosphere.  If the integrity of the piping system is compromised, the loss of vacuum automatically terminates the release of chlorine gas from the system.  \n\nThe ventiliation system is integral to the safety of the chlorination process.  Ths system, which can be operated either automatically or manually, has the inlet vent at floor level because chlorine gas is heavier than air.  A chlorine gas detector triggers warning devises and activates the ventilation system, if atmospheric levels of chlorine gas are detected at one part per million or greater.\n\nPersonal protective equipment is stored remotely to provide safe access in the event that the atmosphere around the chlorine building becomes contaminated.  Emergency repair kits are stored in the DAF building and are painted bright yellow with clear labeling.  These kits are routinely demonstrated in safety training sessions to insure proper knowledge regarding the equipment and its use.  The repair devices are properly maintained and replenished as required to insure availability in the event of an emergency.\n\nIf the automatic chlorine detection equipment fails, leaks are detected through routine inspection using ammonia.  In the presence of chlorine, ammonia produces a white vapor.  Chlorine odors can be detected at levels as low as 0.5 mg/l and an audible hissing can be detected in more serious cases.\n\nTraining programs are in place, providing instruction regarding the proper use of personal protective equipment as well as procedures for routine maintenance repairs.\n\nIf a leak is condidered to be minor, a team of at least two trained facility personnel will make the appropriate repairs.
