The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.13 miles using the TFI Endpoint Distance Modeling using DEGADIS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is a release due to transfer hose failure.  Release quantity from this source is 1,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) based on the TFI lookup tables is 0.5 miles.\n\n\tb.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank.  When filled to the maximum operating capacity this tank would release 950,000 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.6 miles.  The alternative release scenario is based on a release from a transfer hose and associated pipeline during truck filling operations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.06 miles.\n\n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\n\n7 There have been no accidental releases over the past five years.\n\n\n6.\tThe Emergency Response Program\nThe Facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n\t7\tOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\t7\tOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n\t7\tSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the Facility.

If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\n7 The primary activity at the Facility is the blending, storage and shipping of aqua ammonia and the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammoniais received by truck and stored in five above ground pressurized tanks at the site  for blending into aqua ammonia for crop production nutrients.  Tank sizes range from 4,400 gallons to 18,000 gallons.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 270,000 pounds.\n\n7Aqua ammonia is blended on-site and stored in ten above ground tanks at the site ranging in size from 12,000 to 125,000 gallons.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 3,607,140 pounds.\n\nActivity at this facility is exceptionally seasonal.  Of the 41,500 tons of product shipped during the last company fiscal year (Nov 97 - Oct 98), and 42,600 tons shipped in the first seven months of this fiscal year (Nov 98 - May 99), over 80% has occured in the months of April and May.  The remainder of the months in the year see from 0% to about 2% of the annual total being moved.\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\ta.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank.  When filled to"
