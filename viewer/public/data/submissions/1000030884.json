              "Description": "The Utah Olympic Park in Park City, Utah has an ammonia refrigeration system to freeze water to maintain the frozen track surface for sliding. As part of the implementation of the prevention program, the UOP completes a thorough pre-start up safety review of the refrigeration system prior to startup at the beginning of each sliding season. In addition, the UOP conducts employee training on the hazards of ammonia on an ongoing basis. The UOP has developed operating procedures for the refrigeration system, incorporated safe work practices for conducting hot work, lockout/tagout and confined space operations at the facility. The UOP has developed a mechanical integrity program for the refrigeration system equipment to ensure the equipment is maintained in optimum working condition; the UOP uses equipment manufacturers' recommended maintenance tasks and schedules to complete the mechanical integrity program. The UOP has developed a contractor safety program for contractors hired to work on the refrigeration system. Finally, the PSM written program incorporates the UOP emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.",

The following table lists the maximum Utah Olympic Park quantity on site, the EPA threshold quantities (TQ), and the OSHA TQ for ammonia:\n\n\n\nTable I: Utah Olympic Park Bobsled Track Quantities\n\nCAS No.    CHEMICAL NAME    EPA TQ (lb)    OSHA TQ (lb)    Utah Olympic Park (lb)\n\n7664-41-7    Ammonia (Anhydrous)    10,000    10,000    110,000\n\n\n\nAs shown in the table, ammonia is used by the Utah Olympic Park above the threshold quantities for the EPA and OSHA.  The total amount of ammonia is contained in two (2) ammonia storage containers and system piping. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia in the refrigeration system is composed of vapor and liquid under pressure. An accidental release could occur due to any of the following situations:\n\n\n\n1.    Mechanical damage due to forklift or other equipment malfunction\n\n2.    Pipe corrosion\n\n3.    Maintenance oversight\n\n4.    High pressure due to a sensor malfunction\n\nSeveral systems are already in place at the Utah Olympic Park to reduce the risk of an accidental release.  Isolation valves are located in strategic places around the \n\n\n\nIn the case of an accidental release, an emergency response program is in place to notify authorities and the public.  Even in the event of a worst case release of all the ammonia in the system, there will be limited effect on public receptors. The strong odor of ammonia will also aid in the quick notification of authorities in the event of an accidental release, further mitigating the risk. \n\n\n\nA PHA of the process was conducted in July 2012 by Safety Management Services, Inc.  Several of the findings from the PHA have been implemented and several more are in progress.
