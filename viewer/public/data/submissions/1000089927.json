              "Description": "Usually once a year, the facility brings in a contractor with a portable reactor to manufacture liquid fertilizer (10-34-0, ammonium phosphate solution).  Several different contractors have been used (and will be used), including Blick's Phosphate conversions, LLC of Garden City, KS.  The liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in railcars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered in railcars and the most anhydrous ammonia railcars at the facility at any one time is six (6).  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The information reported in this section was obtained from Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC Garden City, KS RMP.",

              "Description": "This facility is a farm cooperative.  We store and provide for application, anhydrous ammonia, dry fertilizers, and several dry and liquid pesticides.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The existing tank was emptied, pipes disconnected and tank disassembled in the summer of 2004, but was re-piped and re-assembled in early 2006.  The second 18,000 gallon storage tank was moved to the facility in early 2006.  After the two tanks were re-assembled, a new hazard review and a new compliance audit were completed at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker truck and railcars, and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling is done by our own employees.  The prevention program consists of seven (7) elements (safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation).",

If an emergency were to occur, it is United Cooperative's policy to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\n5.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe Beaver Dam Facility herein referenced as the stationary source. The primary activity at this facility source) is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients. The anhydrous ammonia is liquefied under pressure in the various storage vessels located at the facility.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system is approximately 411,984 pounds for Program Level 2 activity.  For Program 3, \n\n\n\n5.3    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and a"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\n5.3.1. Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nUnited Cooperative maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  United Cooperative inspection includes two 18,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessels, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n5.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, United Cooperative maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\n5.5    Training\n\n\n\nUnited has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National St"

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n5.10    Planned Changes to Improve Safety (40 CFR 68.155(g)\n\n\n\nThere are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.
