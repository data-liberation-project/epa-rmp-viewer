There have been no chlorine incidents or accidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) that was completed in 1996 has been maintained current for the past five years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program. Key activities have included:\n\noAn annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\noThree Year Refreshed training conducted on June 18, 2004\noA Process Hazards Analysis conducted in October 28, 2002 \noSelf Audits every three years with the last one on October 28, 2004\noA comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program that uses outside expertise to maintain chlorine equipment in top shape\noAn annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills \n\nIn addition to these compliance activities, the City of Roxboro has implemented these chlorine safety controls\n\noThe chlorine delivery system has been upgraded to a state-of-the art vacuum system\noThe site is limiting the amount of chlorine on site to a maximum of six cylinders\n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meeting to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\noHazard Communications\noPersonal Protective Equipment\noLockout/Tagout\noSite Security\noConfined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.                                    \n                                   \nReport by:\nLindsay Mize\nPublic Services Director"
