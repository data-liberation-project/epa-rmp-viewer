Two types of foam lines are utilized at the facility ? an MDI line (Methylenebis(phenylisocyanate)) and a TDI (Toluene diisocyanate) line.  The other major chemical component to the product is polyol.  The maximum storage capacity for polyol storage is 213,000 gallons; 5,000 gallons for MDI, and 27,500 gallons of TDI.  \n\nOnly the TDI process is subject to the RMP requirement.  The TDI is transferred into three indoor storage tanks from railcars.  From the indoor storage tanks, TDI is transferred via hard plumbed lines to smaller retaining tanks for daily use.  \n\nThe TDI foaming line consists of a thirty station race track design line with each station containing one bench seat or two bucket seat molds.  At the first station, the foam (mixture of TDI and polyol) is mechanically poured into the mold.  The lid to the mold is then immediately closed and clamped shut.  The foam is cured as it rotates through the various stations.  The lid is then opened and the foam seat is removed.  The mold is vacuumed clean and a wax release agent is applied to the mold so that it can be used again.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Renosol Seating, LLC Farwell Plant complies with a variety of environmental and safety programs including waste management, air emissions controls, storm water pollution prevention, spill prevention, community right-to-know programs (EPCRA), hazardous materials management, emergency response and many others.  Renosol Seating, LLC has exceeded minimum efforts to comply with these requirements by implementing an ISO 14000 Environmental Management System.  Central to these efforts is a consistent effort to prevent incidents and accidents, includin"

      "SummaryText": "g chemical spills.  \n\nOver the years, Renosol Seating, LLC has invested in equipment, employee training programs, procedural improvements and made various facility improvements to support these prevention efforts.  With respect to prevention of chemical-related incidents, Renosol Seating, LLC has made several investments.  Renosol Seating, LLC constructed containment systems to contain any spills including containment systems that are integrated into railways serving the facility.  These containment systems include concrete and pavement in outdoor chemical delivery and unloading areas, a spill containment pan integrated into the rail line serving the facility.  The TDI is stored indoors within a concrete containment system constructed in an integral fashion with the building.  Strict procedures are also followed when materials are unloaded including the requirement that a person observes the unloading of the entire freight car.  \n\nFixed air monitoring equipment is installed within the building to provide an early warning of any TDI release.  These monitors are inspected and tested on a regular basis to ensure their accuracy and functioning ability.  The principle of detection is based on a chemical reaction caused by the presence of TDI on a chemically impregnated paper tape. A sample of plant air is drawn through the tape by a pump. When TDI is present in the sample, it causes a stain to form on the paper tape. The intensity of the stain is proportional to the concentration of TDI in the sample. A photo diode monitors the stain intensity as a chemical reaction occurs on the paper.  If the intensity of the stain is above a pre-set level, the alarm relays are initiated and an indication is shown on the LCD display.  The display shows flashing bells to indicate that the instrument is in alarm mode.  The alarm condition persists until a reading below the alarm set point is reached. No employee is allowed back into the area until a reading of below the set alarm is reac"

A minimal amount of TDI was released when a hose line on the foaming process ruptured.  One employee complained of exposure but was not injured.  No offsite impacts resulted from the release.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nRenosol Seating, LLC has made a significant effort to communicate the elements of its response program with local emergency responders.  Members of the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Commission have visited the facility.  The facility?s Health, Safety and Environmental Manager maintains his 40-hour HAZWOPER training, among other emergency response training updates and requirements.  Facility personnel involved with the TDI process receive regular training on pollution prevention and emergency response.  This training includes participating in an emergency drill which is documented.   Alert systems are also in place at the facility.  As previously described the facility is equipped with TDI air monitoring devices to provide early warning of a TDI release.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nRenosol Seating, LLC continues to review its programs and procedures and make improvements where necessary.  At this time, no significant improvement needs have been identified."
