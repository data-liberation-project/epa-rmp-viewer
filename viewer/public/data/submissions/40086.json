If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Cook County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a chemical warehouse.  We store, sell and distribute various chemicals. We store and sell two regulated substances:  formaldehyde and hydrofluoric acid. There is one (1) 5,100 gallon and one (1) 3,600 gallon storage tank for formaldehyde(37-11) and formaldehyde(37-7), respectively.  There is one (1) 9,000 gallon storage tank for hydrofluoric acid.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  \n\nFormaldehyde:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considers the potential failure of one (1) 5,100-gallon AST and one (1) 3,600-gallon AST, resulting in a toxic chemical spill.  With administrative controls in place, the worst-case release scenario modeled the release of a total of 60,000 pounds of formaldehyde. Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  It should be noted that the actual release rate to the outside air (0.245 lbs/min) and the release duration (244,898 minutes) could not be inserted into the RMP*Submit format.  Instead, the values of 0.2 lb/min and 9,999 minutes were inserted into the RMP*Submit program for the release rate and release duration, respectively.\n\nOur alternative release scenario considers the potential release of all of the formaldehyde contained in the ASTs (i.e., due to a 12.5 square inch diameter rupture of the AST caused by a forklift arm in the formaldehyde unloading area), resulting in a toxic chemical spill. This scenario assumes that the release  occurs over a 10"

Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles.

With administrative controls in place, the worst-case release scenario modeled the release of a total of 47,098 pounds of hydrofluoric acid. Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.3 miles. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The actual release rate to the outside air for this worse case scenario is 11,322 lbs/min.\n\nOur alternative release scenario considers the potential release of all of the hydrofluoric acid contained in the AST(i.e., due to a 12.5 square inch diameter rupture of the AST caused by a forklift arm in the hydrofluoric acid unloading area), resulting in a toxic chemical spill. This scenario assumes that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  Therefore, our alternative release scenario modeled the release of a total of 36,900 pounds of hydrofluoric acid. Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.2 miles. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The formaldehyde and hydrofluoric acid systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable industry standards and state laws.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never ha"
