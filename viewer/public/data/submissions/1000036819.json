              "Description": "Olefins 1 - This program decription is typical for all processes.\n\n\n\nFormosa Plastics Industrial Park, located on F-M 1593 in Point Comfort, Texas, is operated by Formosa Plastics Corporation, Texas (FPC-TX). FPC-TX is a vertically integrated organization. It consists of 11 \"covered process\" operations. The facility is located in the city of Point Comfort, Calhoun County, Texas. The facility currently employs approximately full time 1,700 employees in addition 500 contractors.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared by the Corporate Process Safety Management Coordinator. Each operating unit has appointed one individual as the person responsible for implementation of the RMP in that Unit. The Environmental, Health and Safety Department, through the Emergency Response Coordinator, oversees, provides guidance, and audits the RMP activities of the operating units.\n\n\n\nCompliance with 29 CFR 1910.119: On May 26, 1992, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule went into effect. FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\n\n\n\nEven though the facility is large the entire site utilizes the same Prevention program throughout the site.  The Olefins unit will be used as a representative unit and the prevention programs of that unit will be reflective of the entire site.    The hazards associated with the chemicals used in the process, requires the unit to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29 CFR 1910.119), N-FPA 58 (Storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases), Spill Prevention Control & Countermeasure program, and other applicable Resource Conservation & Recovery Act rules (RCRA). The equipment installed in the unit was designed based on either ASTM, ANSI, or ASME standards. Before starting the unit, a process hazard analysis (PHA) as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 was completed. The methodologies used were Hazard and Operability methods. Since the last PHA study, additional mitigation systems have been installed.\n\n\n\nDuring the study, the PSM Team evaluated major hazards like: toxic gas release; fire; explosion; runaway reaction; polymerization, over-pressurization and overfilling tanks, reactors, etc; contamination of the chemical; corrosion of pipes; equipment failure; loss of cooling, heating, electricity and instrument air; and natural disasters like floods, tornado and hurricanes.\n\n\n\nBased on the hazards, the Team insured that there were adequate process controls like: vents; relief valves and rupture disks to insure that holding vessels do not fail in case of overfilling or over-pressurization; check valves to insure that the chemicals do not flow back into equipment containing incompatible materials; flares in case of a gas release; manual/ automatic shutoffs and excess flow device to prevent unwanted discharges; alarms and procedures for the operator to take action in case of a process upset; interlocks to insure that the system shuts down in case of an emergency; emergency power supply for equipment to keep functioning until the system can been shut down during utility failure; quench system to cool down heat generating reactions; purge system to ensure that a gas release does not cause an explosion and process area detectors to warn the unit in advance of-the impending danger of a gas release.\n\n\n\nIn case there was an incident, the Team also evaluated the mitigation systems like: sprinkler, foam and water deluge systems to either dilute or keep below the explosion point of a gas release; dikes to ensure that the release does not spread and contaminate the surrounding ground; and neutralization system to ensure that the released chemical becomes non-hazardous to the environment.\n\n\n\nChanges for 2010 include chlorine for this process ",

FPC-TX is a vertically integrated organization. It consists of eleven \"covered process\" operations, and four support organizations. The facility is located in the city of Point Comfort, Calhoun County, Texas. The facility currently employs approximately 1600 employees.\n\n\n\nThe \"Covered Processes\" are:\n\nOlefins 1\n\nOlefins 2\n\nPolypropylene 1\n\nPolypropylene 2\n\nHigh Density Polypropylene 1\n\nHigh Density Polypropylene 2\n\nLinear Low Density Polyethylene\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride\n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\nEthylene Glycol\n\nMarine Traffic\n\nInland Traffic\n\nSpecialty PVC\n\nUtilities\n\nInventory Control\n\nPet-Coke/Coal Energy Generating Facility (CFB)\n\nChlor-Alkali\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared by the Corporate Director of Security & Risk Management\n\nEach operating unit has appointed one individual as the person responsible for implementation of the RMP in that Unit. The Environmental, Health and Safety Department, through the Emergency Response Coordinator, oversee, provide guidance, and audit the RMP activities of the operating units.\n\n\n\nCompliance with 29 CFR 1910.119: On May 26, 1992, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule went into effect. FPC-TX is covered under this rule. The PSM rule consists of fourteen (14) elements. The facility has developed and implemented the fourteen elements of this rule.\n\n\n\nCOVERED PROCESS - BRIEF DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nOlefins 1 & 2\n\n\n\nCombined, Olefins 1 and Olefins 2 have twenty-two pyrolysis furnaces used to crack a range of feedstock consisting of propane (3), natural gas liquids (NGL) (2), naphtha (4), and an ethane/propane mixture (1). The resulting products are ethylene (7), propylene (8), a mixed C4 product (9), pyrolysis gasoline (10), and pyrolysis fuel oil (11). The furnaces are fired with fuel gas (5).

Common to all production lines are the Raw Material Tank Farm, Purification Area, and Catalyst Preparation Area.\n\n\n\nAll raw materials, propylene, hydrogen, nitrogen, ethylene, propylene oxide, and hexane are purified in molecular sieve columns to remove carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and moisture. Pellets from the drier are sent to the Pellet Blending Silos for mixing to develop a homogeneous product. From the blending silos, the pellets are sent to the Pellet Product Silos for temporary storage. The PP pellets (L) are then loaded into railcars and sent to customers.

Ultimately the polymer is cut into pellets and then transferred to blending silos before being loaded for product shipping. \n\n\n\nLinear Low Density Polyethylene\n\n\n\nThe LLDPE Plant is designed to produce Linear Low Density Polyethylene using two parallel reactor lines. The process employs a gas phase fluidized bed reactor in which ethylene and co-monomers are polymerized using a proprietary catalyst. Ethylene, hydrogen, and a co-monomer are reacted with injected pre-polymer powder in a fluidized bed reactor to produce LLDPE. This product is continuously withdrawn via a lateral withdrawal system for degassing and downstream process. The virgin powder is received and blended with additives for extrusion and pelletization. The product pellets are then pneumatically transferred to the product storage area.  1-Butene is used as monomer and titanium tetrachloride is a co-catalyst for reaction.  Chlorine is utilized for biocide in cooling water tower.\n\n\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride\n\n\n\nThe PVC process is suspension polymerization. The general overall process involves the suspension of liquid vinyl chloride monomer in a continuous water phase. The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction. The reaction is initiated most commonly with organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags.\n\n\n\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\n\n\n\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene. Four oxychlorination trains are used to combine ethylene, hydrogen chloride, and oxygen to form ethylene dichloride. Purified EDC (10) is thermally cracked into VCM and HCl in the EDC Crackers.

Chlorine is utilized for biocide in cooling water tower.  \n\n\n\nEthylene Glycol\n\n\n\nThe Ethylene Glycol plant produces monoethylene glycol, diethylene glyco, and triethylene glycol. The glycols are produced in two major steps. Oxygen from the Air Separation Plant (ASP) is reacted with ethylene from the Olefins Plant to form ethylene oxide (EO). EO is produced in the Scientific Design licensed glycol reaction and scrubbing section utilizing Mitsubishi reactors. This safe process begins with only 10 percent EO in a hydrolysis process to produce EG. There is no storage of EO on the site. If the EG unit is not running, the EO unit is shut down. The glycol is distilled into MEG, DEG, and TEG products. All process vents, except for the carbon dioxide regeneration vent, are directed to a furnace. Flammable mixture of ethylene and ethane is used in the process. Methane is used as a carrier during reaction. Chlorine is utilized for biocide in cooling water tower.  \n\n\n\nSpecialty PVC\n\n\n\nSpecialty Poly-Vinyl Chloride or SPVC involves the co-polymerization of VCM (Vinyl Chloride Monomer) and VAM (Vinyl Acetate Monomer). The process produces a fine, white powder that has many end product applications including: flooring, carpet backing, automobile underbody coatings, anti-fog applications, medical gloves, furniture, road cones, and many more. The production of SPVC involves three separate processes: (1) Emulsion Process; (2) Suspension-blending resin process and (3) Suspension-copolymer process.
