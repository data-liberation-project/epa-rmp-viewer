Well-defined safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including storage, handling, on-site movement of chemicals, or any combination of these activities listed.\n\n\n\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility located in Cranbury, New Jersey, is a warehouse used for the distribution of cosmetic products.  The facility currently receives and stores aerosol cans containing compressed gases and liquids.  The aerosol cans contain a flammable mixture.  The facility does not have any regulated toxic substances.  The L'Oreal Facility is an EPA RMP Program 1 Level facility and a NJ TCPA Program 3 Level facility.\n\n\n\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical -Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements. \n\n- Safety Information: The L'Oreal Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process.  These documents address hazards of the aerosols at the facility, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n- Hazard Review:  Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n- Operating Procedures: The L'Oreal Facility uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training to assure the work they are doing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety o"
