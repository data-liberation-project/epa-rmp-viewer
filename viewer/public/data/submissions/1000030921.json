The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\u00bf To save lives.\r\n\u00bf To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n\u00bf To protect the environment.\r\n\u00bf To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility maintains a safety committee (a trained Emergency Response team) whose members are designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The emergency response team is trained to call 9-1-1 in an event of an ammonia release.  The 9-1-1 operator will contact the Mt. Sterling Fire Department.  \r\n\r\nEmployees within the building are evacuated to a point upwind of the facility or shelter in place.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed in 12/5/2013 for Engine Room #1 & #2, 3/11/2011 for Engine Room #3, and 9/26/2013 for Engine Room #4, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the DOT Foods, Inc. facility located at 1 Dot Way, Mt. Sterling, Illinois.  The scheduled completion date of all changes resulting from the PHA's is 12/5/2014.  In the meantime, DOT Foods, Inc. safety committee has completed several items, including the recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.

These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine rooms as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine rooms roof (condensers).\r\n\r\nThere are ammonia and temperature sensors placed in the engine rooms (#1 & #2, #3, and #4), freezer, cooler, and dock areas.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds and a visible alarm is triggered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, in particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Start-up, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods, Inc. \u00bf Mt.
