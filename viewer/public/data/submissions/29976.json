This systems uses approximately 12,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nThe refrigeration system for Wegmans Fresh Food Distribution Center is regulated by the OSHA standard for process safety management (29CFR 1910.119). Wegmans meets the requirements for PSM at this facility and has applied this program as the Program 3 Prevention program for this RMP.\n\nIn addition to the PSM requirements, refrigeration system operators conduct daily walkdowns to assess system condition and operation. Items requiring attentionare acted upon immediately. Less serious conditions are logged and remedied in a timely manner. Preventive maintenance is conducted based upon manufacturer's recommendations and using manufacturer's parts and instructions.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe Fresh Food Distribution Center refrigeration system is monitored by ammonia sensors that are wired directly to Wegmans Corporate Security Control Center and the Gates Fire Department. In the event of an ammonia release emergency, site security will contact the Gates Fire Department and request they respond. If necessary, the Gates Fire Department will ask the Monroe County HAZMAT team to also respond.\n\nThe facility has written emergency procedures. Several members of Wegmans emergency response team are trained in the use of personal protective equipment and will assist the Gates Fire Department in accident mitigation and response. The Gates Fire Department has trained with Wegmans personnel at the facility. Training is conducted annually with the next training session scheduled in May, 2004.\n\nFive Ye"
