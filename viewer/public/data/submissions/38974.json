The plant's products are used to make materials that are used in a variety of different industries for laboratory testing and pharmaceutical and electronic components manufacturing. \n\nTwo of the materials used by the facility are chloroform and ethyl ether, which are on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  The Honeywell Muskegon plant's storage and use of chloroform and ethyl ether exceeds the specified thresholds of 20,000 lbs. and 10,000 lbs. respectively, as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.  \n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the Honeywell Muskegon plant: \n\n1) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source: \n\nIt is the policy of the Honeywell Muskegon plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, and environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to ensure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with the plant's use of chloroform and ethyl ether involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, the preparation and testing of site emergency response plans, the maintenance of onsite emergency response equipment and a trained Emergency Coordinating Team, coordinating our efforts and resources with local emergency response services, and communicating with the community. \n\n2) The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:  \n\nThe Honeywell Muskegon site stores chloroform a"

They are stored in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities specified in the RMP Rule.\n\nThe site's stationary source of chloroform consists of a tanker unloading area and a bulk storage tank.  Chloroform is purchased from an outside vendor and is delivered to the plant via tank truck on an \"as needed\" basis.  The tanker's contents are unloaded by plant operators into an above-ground bulk storage tank identified as #13, which is located in the south outdoor, above-ground tank farm.\n\nThe site's stationary source of ethyl ether consists of a tanker unloading area and a bulk storage tank.

The Plan addresses emergency medical care, in-place sheltering, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the site's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the Muskegon Fire Department who would direct all  community response activities in conjunction with the site's  Emergency Coordination Team (ECT).  The ECT comprises technical professionals capable of serving as a technical resource to municipal responders as well as coordinating safe evacuation of onsite personnel, recovery and start-up operations.  The ECT organizes and conducts plant emergency drills and exercises.  Annual in-house audits of the site's emergency response system are performed.\n\n\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nProcess hazard analyses of the Honeywell Muskegon site's stationary sources of chloroform and ethyl ether were completed in October, 2003.  As a result of systematic safety review, several action items were identified and implemented to improve upon the existing safeguards of the covered source and to further reduce the potential for accidental release. The process hazard analysis for the chloroform and ethyl ether stationary sources will be reviewed and revalidated at least every five years."
