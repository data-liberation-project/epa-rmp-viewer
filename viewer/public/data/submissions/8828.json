Corporate Prevention  and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Winn-Dixie) Tampa Warehouse Facility is the Tampa Division headquarters of the Winn-Dixie located at Tampa, Florida.  Winn-Dixie requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie\u0012s corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Tampa Warehouse is located at 2400 East Hillsborough Avenue in the northeast corner of the city of Tampa, Florida.  The warehouse consists of areas for dry, frozen, and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to the Winn-Dixie Supermarkets.\n\nThe Winn-Dixie Tampa Warehouse has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which individually do not exceed the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  However, these systems proximity to each other requires us to consider them as one process subject to RMP.  The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in the southwest and northeast corners of the property in the compressor rooms.  The high pressure receivers (HPRs) or storage vessels are located outside of each of these rooms.  The HPRs are the largest capacity vessels in both ammonia refrigeration systems capable of holding 8,479 and 6,284 lbs. of ammonia, in the east and west process respectively.  \n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of the east HPR, releasing 8,479 lbs. of ammonia gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, the ammonia gas could travel 1. 1 miles before dispersing enou"

Under normally expected weather conditions, the ammonia gas could travel 0.30 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .14 mg/L), using The Ammonia Guidance.\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places both of the Tampa Warehouse refrigeration processes in the Program 3 level.  The Tampa Warehouse facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Tampa Warehouse has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in 1998 for the ammonia process.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, the Tampa Warehouse also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineer"

Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  To ensure that the Tampa Warehouse refrigeration staff has the skills necessary to identify unsafe conditions, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) training was conducted.  The staff also performed a PHA of this process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Tampa Warehouse facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Tampa Warehouse Facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Hillsborough County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911."
