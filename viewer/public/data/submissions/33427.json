The plant is  located  in  a\n\nrural  area  about 0.4 of a mile from Highway 139  near  mile\n\nmarker  24.   The  plant receives dehydrated natural  gas  by\n\npipeline, removes condensable natural gas liquids (NGLs)  and\n\ncarbon dioxide, and ultimately delivers the natural gas to  a\n\ntransmission pipeline.\n\n\n\nOperators  of  the  facility have an on-going  commitment  to\n\nsafety   and   accident  prevention.   This   commitment   is\n\ndemonstrated by upper managements support of an  active  EH&S\n\nprogram. An employee training program is implemented as  part\n\nof  a  comprehensive EH&S management system and  the  use  of\n\nestablished  design  and construction standards  (API,  ASME,\n\nNEC),  and  the  installation of a state-of-the  art  process\n\ncontrol  and monitoring system.  The facility was constructed\n\nby  skilled  tradesmen who, in many cases, were  required  to\n\ndemonstrate  their skills and pass certification requirements\n\nprior  to  working  on  the project.   On-going  construction\n\ninspection  and  quality assurance procedures included  x-ray\n\nexamination  of welds for additional quality control.   Shop-\n\nfabricated  equipment mounted on skid units were  used  where\n\npossible to minimize field construction.\n\n\n\nAt  this  facility, critical process parameters are monitored\n\nremotely  on  a 24-hour basis using supervisory  control  and\n\ndata acquisition (SCADA) technologies.  This approach enables\n\noperation  without  full-time onsite  personnel.   The  SCADA\n\nsystems permit both automated and operator-directed responses\n\nto  process  conditions  in addition to  providing  immediate\n\nannunciation"

Plant personnel  are  trained  to\n\nrespond  to remote alarm conditions with both remote and  on-\n\nscene  responses.  Various automatic process  safeguards  and\n\ninterlocks are intended to preclude a release.  If a  release\n\nshould   occur,  these  systems  allow  an  immediate  remote\n\nresponse  from  trained operators as well as  alerting  other\n\npersonnel to the need for an onsite response.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Hay Canyon Amine Plant consists of a number of production\n\nunits and/or scrubbers to remove liquids from the natural gas\n\nprocess stream, an amine unit to remove carbon dioxide, and a\n\nJoule-Thompson  (JT)  expansion unit to extract  natural  gas\n\nliquids  (NGL).   On  a  daily basis the  facility  processes\n\napproximately 4 to 5 million standard cubic feet  (MMscf)  of\n\ndehydrated  natural  gas per day and the  JT  expansion  unit\n\nextracts  approximately 800 gallons of  NGL.  The  NGL  is  a\n\nflammable  mixture consisting of multiple regulated flammable\n\nsubstances  including methane, ethane, propane,  butane,  and\n\npentane.    Included  with  the  regulated   flammables   are\n\nadditional non-regulated flammables in the C-6 through  C-10+\n\nrange.   The  NGL  is  stored at ambient  temperatures  in  a\n\npressure  vessel  maintained at  approximately  230  psig  to\n\ncontrol  vapor  release.  The various  production  units  and\n\nscrubbers  remove  produced water  and  condensate  from  the\n\nprocess  stream and direct the liquids to either of  two  (2)\n\n100  barrel  (bbl) vertical atmospheric storage  tanks  (slop\n\ntanks).  The slop liquids mixture contains multiple regulated\n\nflammable  substances  including  methane,  ethane,  propane,\n\nbutane,  and pentane.

A plot plan of the facility is  included  in\n\nthe offsite consequence analysis for the facility.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAt  the subject facility, regulated flammable substances  are\n\ngenerated  and stored as a result of two separate operations;\n\nthe  separation of slop liquids, and the extraction  of  NGL.\n\nThe  slop and NGL storage vessels are not connected,  however\n\nthe  storage  vessels for the two operations are  located  in\n\nclose  proximity.   Due  to the lack of intervening  distance\n\nbetween  the  slop  and  NGL vessels,  a  fire  or  explosion\n\ninvolving   the  vessels  related  to  one  operation   could\n\npotentially  spread  to the storage vessels  for  the  second\n\noperation.   Therefore,  for  the  purpose  of  the   offsite\n\nconsequence analysis, the slop and NGL vessels are considered\n\nto be one process.\n\n\n\nThe  worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a  release  of\n\nflammable  substances from the subject facility  is  a  vapor\n\ncloud  explosion  (VCE)  involving  the  full  inventory   of\n\nflammable  materials  for  both  the  NGL  and  slop  storage\n\nvessels,  including  flammable  materials  contained  in  the\n\nassociated piping.  The endpoint for the consequence analysis\n\nis  the  extent of the 1 psi overpressure resulting from  the\n\nVCE.\n\n\n\nAt  the  subject  facility,  the total  volume  of  flammable\n\nmaterials  is  27,200 gallons, assuming that  the  associated\n\npiping  contains 3% of the storage volume.  For the WCS,  the\n\nentire flammable material inventory is assumed to release and\n\nignite resulting in a VCE.  There are numerous safety systems\n\nand   administrative  controls  to  prevent  such   releases,\n\nincluding  physical isolation of the tanks,  pressure  relief\n\nvalves, remotely operated shut-off valves, and remote  level,\n\npressure,  and temperature monitoring; however no credit  for\n\nadministrative or passive mitigation measures was  considered\n\nfor evaluating the WCS.\n\n\n\nThe  offsite  consequence analysis for the"
