      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Cherokee Nitrogen Company Facility\n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nWe at Cherokee Nitrogen are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.0    Cherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes. Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins. Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\n\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.  Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. \n\nWe have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the urea and ammonium nitrate solutions. Chlorine is used to treat the incoming process water prior to use by the facility. Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. \n\nTypically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions: industrial-grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution, and a high pressure solution co"
