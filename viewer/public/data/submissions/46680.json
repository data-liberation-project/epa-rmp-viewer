This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.0    Cherokee Nitrogen Company and Regulated Substances \n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of ammonia and related processes. Ammonia is a natural part of the life process.  It is produced internally by all humans and mammals to process essential proteins. Ammonia is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals in the world, and is commonly used to purify water and refrigerate foods.\n\nThe company is a supplier to the fertilizer, explosives, and commercial industries by manufacturing ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions, and other products.  Cherokee Nitrogen markets its fertilizers to distributors, dealers, national farm retail chains, regional farm cooperatives, and other fertilizer producers for ultimate sale and delivery to farmers. \n\nWe have four regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid (<80 percent).  Aqueous ammonia is contained within the urea and ammonium nitrate solutions. Chlorine is used to treat the incoming process water prior to use by the facility. Sulfur dioxide is used to treat the outgoing process water prior to discharge from the facility. \n\nTypically, the facility manufactures two types of ammonium nitrate solutions: industrial-grade (83 weight percent) ammonium nitrate solution, and a high pressure solution co"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n3.4    Training\n\nCherokee Nitrogen has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n3.5    Mechanical Integrity\n\nCherokee Nitrogen carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  \n\nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n3.6    Management of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Cherokee Nitrogen to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of Management of Change procedures was performed on 05/05/2006.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n3.7    Pre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cherokee Nitrogen.  The most recent review was performed on 10/17/2005.
