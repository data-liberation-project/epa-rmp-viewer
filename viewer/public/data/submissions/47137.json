      "SummaryText": "of water treatment, in simple terms, is the addition of a substance called a coagulant to change the electrical charge of the water so we can form a heavier substance that will envelope undesirable elements and fall to the bottom of a basin designed for settling.\n\nOne of the processes we use is a disinfection process.  Water-borne diseases, bacteria, viruses, and cysts can live and grow in water so we disinfect to kill these undesirables.  The disinfectant we use is chlorine.  Chlorine will kill almost any living creature and therefore, is a very effective disinfectant.  \nBecause chlorine can be so deadly, we take great care in how we handle and store chlorine.  Chlorine is shipped to us on flat-bed trucks.  The trucks carry cylinders that hold 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine.  Each container has been thoroughly inspected and certified by the chemical manufacturer before it was filled with chlorine. We normally would have no more than four full cylinders on hand at any one time.\nThe chlorine takes the form of gas in the upper parts of the cylinders and that is what we use to mix with water to create a chlorine disinfecting dose to add to the water.\nWe store the cylinders in a room that was specially designed to house the cylinders.  Every precaution has been taken to insure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nChlorine gas can be deadly. Chlorine is heavier than air and therefore will seek the lowest levels of terrain.  Chlorine is a yellowish gas and will burn the skin, eyes and mucous membranes.  It will severely damage lungs, possibly causing death.  \n\nMINIMAL DISCHARGE - This type of discharge would be only a small amount of chlorine gas escaping during routine cylinder exchange.  The amount of chlorine discharged would not exceed a 15 second release of 5/8 tubing.  \n\nThis release scenario has no offsite impact.

This release would normally last for approximately one hour with 317 lbs. of chlorine gas escaping at a rate of 10.5 lbs/min.

If there are no leaks, the cylinder is placed in service or in standby.\nThe operator then logs the date, time, personnel in attendance, cylinder number, and a description of any problems which occurred along with recommendations for parts replacement or necessary repairs.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nThe Saugahatchee Lake Filter Plant has never had an accidental chlorine release that would impact any offsite premises.  \n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nChlorine 1-ton cylinders are stored in a room designed specifically for chlorine.  The room has chlorine detectors that are serviced annually and are part of the training program for all employees.  The detectors are linked to a discharge fan system which carries escaping gas out of the facility so that repairs can be done on the leaking cylinder or line.  The detectors are also connected to a warning system which intermittently sounds a warning horn and flashes a red warning light. \n\nEach employee is trained on the proper methods for removing empty cylinders and replacing them with full cylinders.  We use the buddy system any time we connect to or disconnect tubing from the cylinders.  We do not allow one person to be alone at any time during any procedure that might cause chlorine gas to leak or"

The amount of chlorine discharged would not exceed a 15 second release of 5/8 tubing.  \n\nThe procedure is described in the exchange and replacement of chlorine cylinders.\n\nMODERATELY SEVERE DISCHARGE - A moderately severe discharge would be one in which a supply line or valve ruptured and chlorine gas was escaping at a rate of  ap"

This will eliminate our need to have gaseous chlorine at our treatment plants and would greatly enhance the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.
