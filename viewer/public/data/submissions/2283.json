      "SummaryText": "1.Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Royster-Clark, Inc., Shawbor,  NC., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of ammonia from Aqua Ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel have been instructed and are prepared to work with the Currituck County Emergency personnel, the Crawford Volunteer Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the Shawboro #2 facility of Royster-Clark, Inc., is the blending and storage of fertilizer for sales to agricultural users (farmers).\n\nAqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia is received by tanker truck, stored, and used from the storage tanks in the production of mixed-grade liquid fertilizer for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia stored at this facility would be 180,000 pounds in 2 - 12,000 gallon tanks each of which are located in a 4,000 square foot dike.  This would be 54,000 pounds of ammonia at the maximum of 30% ammonia content.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of Aqua Ammonia containing a maximum of 30% ammonia from one of the 12,000 gallon storage tanks in the diked area released as a liquid over a 615 minute period.  The maximum amount released would be 90,000 pounds of Aqua Ammonia which would contain 27,000 pounds ammonia at 30% maximum ammonia content.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis - and the passive mitigation of the 4,000 sq.ft. dike, is 0.30 miles. The release would affect 0 residents.   The possibility of this worst case release occurring is extremely unlikely as location personnel regularly inspect and r"

The alternate release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Aqua Ammonia from a ruptured 3 inch transfer hose, during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 1 minute.  The calculated quantity of Aqua Ammonia released would be 1500 pounds which is 450 pounds of ammonia, based on the maximum of 30% ammonia content. The distance to the end point of  200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's Model - Degradis - is 0.07 miles.    This is 370 feet and would  affect 0 residents.  The possibility of this alternate release scenario occurring is unlikely as Shawboro #2 personnel periodically inspect, repair and replace equipment according to industry standard procedure.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release prevention program:\n\nThe Shawboro #2 facility has implemented the provisions of Aqua Ammonia supplier's recommendations for safe handling of Aqua Ammonia and appropriate OSHA regulations.  Additionally, periodic training in handling, storage and use of Aqua Ammonia is conducted with personnel at this location.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or has resulted in any off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThis facility has:\n\na. A written emergency response plan which is incorporated in the written community emergency response plan of Currituck County.\n\nb.
