      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Nu-Foam Products, Inc. (Nu-Foam) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to seven standby railcars) at our plant is about 750,000 l"

The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\n(DELETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 4/9/2004 Rulemaking)\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA's process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7 Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes, and equipment\n \n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7 Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n \n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7 Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n \n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7 Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n \n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7 Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes\n \n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00b7 Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the R"

Our Emergency Action Program/Contingency Plan includes procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities, by using management of change procedures.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n \n The emergency response plan for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes providing them with a copy of the ERP and subsequent telephone call and invitation to tour the plant.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating"
