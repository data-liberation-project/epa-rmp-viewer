The service area is located at an elevation of approximately 8,000 feet on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  The town is surrounded by the United States Forest Service lands and is heavily utilized as a recreational area.\r\n\r\nThe District has instituted a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to ensure that its facilities utilizing regulated hazardous chemical substances are operated according to the rules established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  \r\n\r\nThrough its RMP, the District has performed a hazard assessment to assess the potential effects of an accidental release of a hazardous substance.  The RMP includes safety precautions and maintenance, monitoring and employee safety training.\r\n\r\nA response program has also been established that requires specific action to be taken in emergency situations.  This includes procedures for notifying public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases, information on emergency health care, and employee response training measures.\r\n\r\nDescription of Facilities and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Districts Wastewater Treatment Facility utilizes chlorine for disinfection purposes.  This facility is located at the eastern edge of the town and treats all wastewater generated by the community.  The facility is considered a secondary treatment facility and includes processes of primary clarification, biological treatment, secondary clarification, filtration and disinfection.  Chlorine solution gas is injected into the treated wastewater to kill any potential disease causing organisms.  Up to ten cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas each are stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\n\r\nA worst-case release scenario at"

      "SummaryText": "the Wastewater Treatment Facility would involve major damage to a valve incurred while loading or offloading chlorine gas cylinders.  This could result in release of chlorine gas from the container at a rate of 200 lbs. per minute with the release lasting ten minutes.  At this release rate, toxic gas could extend over a distance of 1.3 miles.  The affected area would involve a maximum of 14,387 people and would include residential areas, industrial areas, commercial areas, hospital and elementary, middle, high school and college facilities.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternative released scenario at the Wastewater Treatment Facility is similar to that considered for the water treatment facility.  A leak would occur at the valve while the cylinder was being connected into the system.  At a release rate of one pound per minute, toxic gas would extend over a distance of 0.1 miles.  A toxic atmosphere could impact the District operations and administrative offices and could involve 50 people.  Again, it is unlikely that the entire content of a cylinder would be released because personnel would be on-hand to immediately respond and stop any leak.\r\n\r\nAdditional Scenario Concerns to the Community\r\n\r\nIn addressing the earthquake disaster potential, the one-ton containers are cradled on engineered blocks attached to the floor and strapped in place, which prevents movement.  The connecting lines from the cylinders to the system are made of flexible material.  This has proved a very effective method during high earthquake activity.  With 5.6 magnitude earthquakes that occurred in recent years there were no incidents at the facility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe District is currently in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule for Process Safety Management and with the Risk Management Plan Rule.\r\n\r\nSpecific prevention steps that the District has taken include a computeri"

District personnel also receive specific training in the use of chlorine cylinders and apparatus.  Only the necessary amount of chlorine required for use in the treatment processes is stored at the Wastewater Treatment Facility to minimize the potential hazards.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe wastewater Treatment Facility has experienced no accidental release of chlorine gas during the last five years and in fact has not experienced any accidental releases since it began using chlorine in 1972.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe District relies upon the emergency services of the Mammoth Lakes Fire Protection District to respond to a release of chlorine gas."
