Speedway Water Works is a water treatment facility located in the Town of Speedway, Indiana.  Chlorine is the only current RMP regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is utilized for the disinfection of drinking water.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario was conducted based on the recommended EPA parameters.  This scenario consisted of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine gas being released in 10 minutes.  The building enclosure was considered in the modeling which limited the release rate to 110 pounds per minute.  The worst-case release scenario resulted in off-site impact.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a bad connection with the 1-ton cylinder.  This scenario consisted of gaseous chlorine leaking out of the 5/16-inch valve body opening.  The release rate was 10.5 pounds per minute over a 60-minute duration.  The recommended EPA atmospheric parameters were used in the modeling.  The building enclosure was considered.  The alternative release scenario resulted in off-site impact.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program for the Speedway Water Works consists of all the required prevention program 3 elements.  In the past five years, the Speedway Water Works has not had an accidental chlorine release.  The facility is included under the community emergency response plan.  Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\r\n\r\nThis update is required by the EPA due to the 5-year resubmittal timeline.  \r\n\r\nAlterations modifications are currently being made to the chlorine process, the process is off-line until construction is completed, all pre-start up and management of change requirements are being/will be followed and documented.  We are installing UV reactors for primary disinfection and are adding 1 additional chlorination injection point which requires an additional chlorinator and pipin"
