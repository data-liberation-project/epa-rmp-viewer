If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information:\r\nA)\tThe activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\nB)\tAnhydrous ammonia is used in the production of liquid fertilizer.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\nA)\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2) is 4 miles.\r\n\r\nB)\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2) is 1.3 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of CGA G2.1-2014 Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (an American National Standard) and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.\t5.
