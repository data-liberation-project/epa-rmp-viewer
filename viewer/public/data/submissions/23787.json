      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA)  Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Uni-Kool Mills Facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to seasonal startup and during operations.  These procedures identify potential sources of release.   Equipment corrections and repairs are made to prevent any release.  The refrigeration equipment is inspected by on site personnel, mechanical engineers, and refrigeration contractors as required.  \n\nOn-site personnel provide  initial emergency response.  On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.  First response may include emergency equiment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as a pump down to prevent or reduce any off-site release.  Emergency response for a major release event will be provided by local fire and police departments.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five years.\n\nTraining and familiarity with the company's Safety and Operating Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are required by all persons responsible for Ammonia refrigeration maintenance and operations.  Maintenance and operations personnel will also be required to become familiar with this RMP.\n\nb)  Description of source and substance Handled:\n\nThe Cooling Facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their produce and cold storage operations.\n\nThe refrigeration equipment consists of a cold room with (14) evaporators and high side refrigeration system as a stationary source and   two  Portable Hydro-Vac tubes for vacuum cooling process.\n \nc)  Worst case and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios were evaluated using the methodologies recommended in the RMP off site Consequence analysis guidance as prepared by the EPA.   As part of this guidance a Model"

      "SummaryText": " Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration was prepared to identify specific release scenarios for Ammonia-based refrigeration systems.  The atmospheric conditions used are specified in this guidance and the regulations.\n\nThe worst case release considers the complete release of the maximum charge in any individual system within a 10 minute period.  The alternative release considers the release of high pressure liquid from a charging hose leaking outside the building.  No mitigation measures are considered for each release.\n\nAs a result of the off-site consequence analysis, administrative and passive controls limit the release of the Ammonia in the system. For the worst case scenario, gas is released for a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated at 7500 ft.  For the alternative release scenarios, the maximum extent of the release is 1160 ft  off site in any direction.\n\nThe results of the worst case and alternative case release scenarios are presented in Section 4, Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nd) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs described above, the program consists of pre-startup inspection, emergency response, and regular training.  A thorough review of the system including a Hazard and Operability study (HazOp) was performed prior to start up for the 2001 season.  Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for off-site releases.  Safety and equipment operational training will be conducted annually and will include equipment operational procedures, emergency response procedures, review of business Response Plan procedures, and evacuation procedures.  hose items requiring further review, correction and or updating are listed under Section 4,  correction items.\n\ne) Five Year Accident History:\n\nNo reportable releases or accidents relating  to the release of ammonia have occurred at the facility in the last five years.\n\nf) Emergency Response Pr"

      "SummaryText": "ogram:\n\nThe facility has implemented the State and County mandated Acutely Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan or Business Response Plan (BRP).  This plan outlines procedures for the emergency ammonia release response as well as general facility response.\n\ng) Planned Safety Improvements:\n\nSafety improvements have been identified during the preparation of this program.  These improvements have been documented and a schedule will be developed for their implementation.  Some of these improvements include change out of pressure valves every five years, restraints of  portable equipment and operational procedures."
