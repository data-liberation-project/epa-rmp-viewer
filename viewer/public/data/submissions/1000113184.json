The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system owned and operated by NOR-AM Cold Storage, 1301 Oak St., Elwood, KS., 66024. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia-which is classified as a highly hazardous chemical, liquefied under pressure.\n\nThis is an existing food distribution facility.  There is one ammonia refrigeration system at this facility with an inventory of 26,042 pounds of ammonia. The process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nLike most refrigerated warehouse facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nNor-Am Cold Storage is committed to maintaining a safe warehouse operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\n\nWe used the EPA's ammonia model ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels. (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the"
