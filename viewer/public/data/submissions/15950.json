      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only material considered hazardous at this facility is aqua ( a 20 wt% solution of ammonia in water).  Our facility has three atmospheric-preessure 30,000 gallon tanks for storing aqua, equipment for receiving aqua by truck and equipment for transferring aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.\n\nIt is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling aqua.\nThis includes diking our storage facility to contain any spills and thereby prevent soil and water contamination and minimize ammonia release from any spills.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Dayton Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of a storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 0.31 miles from our facility, and would impact some residences and some of the Dayton business area, but no hospitals, or schools.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According our analysis and information supplied by the EPA, the impact from such a release would only extend 261 feet and would not impact any residences, hospitals, schools, or commercial areas."
