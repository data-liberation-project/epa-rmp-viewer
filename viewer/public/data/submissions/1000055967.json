He was in the process of unhooking the hose from the tanker truck which should not have had any pressure on it.  He opened and closed an inlet valve to the pump thinking he had relieved all the pressure in the unloading hose. In doing so, he closed the valve leading into the pump rather than closing the valve on top of the pump.  When he unhooked the hose from the tanker truck it blew off pressure spraying no more than 20 gallons of the non-RCRA/non-RMP liquid fuel on his body and face, the tanker truck, and the surrounding building walls and floor.  All was contained in the unloading area containment system.  He immediately went to the local eyewash and safety shower and flushed his eyes and skin.  We had him visit a Doctor to evaluate the exposure which resulted in the Material Handler receiving a prescription for eye drops to heal the irritation in his eyes.  The Material Handler was released back to full duty after one day of restricted duty; no lost time from work resulted from this incident.  Based on the incident investigation team report, full face respirators are to be used for unhooking and hooking up hoses to tanker trucks and rail cars.

The Hazard Review shall be updated minimally every 5 years or with any process or equipment change that occurs that impacts the covered processes. \r\n\r\n11.\tOPERATING PROCEDURES\t68.52\r\nGeocycle has written operating procedures (OPs) that describe in detail what tasks a process operator must perform.  The OPs set safe process operating parameters that must be maintained.  It lists the set safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  These procedures are the guide for employees on how to work safely, providing a readily accessible source of comprehensive information that can prevent or mitigate the effects of an accident.  Finally, it provides workers and management with a standard against which to assess performance.\r\nGeocycle must have written operating procedures for each of the following:\r\n11.1.\tInitial start-up\r\n11.2.\tNormal operations\r\n11.3.\tTemporary operations\r\n11.4.\tEmergency shutdown\r\n11.5.\tEmergency operations\r\n11.6.\tNormal shutdown\r\n11.7.\tStartup following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change\r\n11.8.\tConsequence of deviation and steps required to avoid or correct deviations and\r\n11.9.\tEquipment inspection\r\nThe operating procedures are updated any time there is a change in the process in a way that alters the steps needed to operate safely.

Also, training is given any time the procedures are revised as everyone must be trained in using the new procedures.  Training for the RMP program is given at least once every three years.  Finally, training will be given more often if necessary; employees will be consulted by Geocycle to establish a refresher training regimen.  Refresher training is provided on the operating procedures even if they have not changed.  The training must cover all parts of the operating procedures, including information on the consequences of deviations and steps needed to address deviations. \r\nUnder the provisions of 40 CFR \u00a7 68.54(c), the facility \"may use training conducted under Federal or state regulations or under industry specific standards or codes or training conducted by covered process equipment vendors to demonstrate compliance with this section to the extent that the training meets the requirements of this section\".  Under the prevailing federal RCRA regulations, all HWDF facility and cement plant employees associated with hazardous waste operations are trained within 6 months of hire.  The training includes the following:\r\n12.1.\t24 Hours initial RCRA/MSHA hazardous waste operations and emergency training  \r\n12.2.\t8 hours RCRA/MSHA annual refresher training\r\n12.3.\tClassroom and on-the-job training is conducted, along with written examinations as required.
