This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facilityA?s processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator located in Ascension Parish, Louisiana is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC (formerly known as Tejas Gas Processing, LLC) and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator receives mixed natural gas liquids (raw make) from the Enterprise North Terrebonne Gas Plant.  This raw make is fed to the plant fractionation process comprised of a feed system, DeEthanizer, DePropanizer, DeButanizer, Butane Splitter and Tank Storage.  In addition, there is a Refrigeration system that is used on the DeEthanizer for ethane/propane vapor condensing.  The finished natural gas liquids products are shipped out via pipeline, transport trucks or rail cars.\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Tebone Fractionator are raw make, propane, isobutane, normal butane, natural gasoline and ethyl mercaptan.

Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the plant for use as an LPG odorant.  The actual amount of ethyl mercaptan in storage is usually kept at a minimum unless a favorable market price results in extra purchase.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the ARP program.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Tebone Fractionator Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help insure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training session if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors as well as bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs as well as to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and tr"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operator and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involved both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the tasks and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instruction or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Tebone Fractionator has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in fractionation plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator has a comprehensive system to manage change to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator p"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Tebone Fractionator have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Tebone Fractionator.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release a"

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n> Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n> Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n> Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n> Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n> Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\n> Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump).\n> Atmospheric relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n> Fire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n> Deluge system for specific equipment.\n> Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n> Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years there have been no accidental releases.\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Tebone Fractionator is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Gonzales Area Mutual-Aid Associatio"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Tebone Fractionator has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meeting, the Tebone Fractionator conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC, GAMA and other emergency response organizations.  The Tebone Fractionator also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audits and incident investigation findings:\n\n> The Enterprise safety management / accident prevention (PSM) program is currently undergoing a complete review and updating to insure that the program correctly reflects the safety management practices being used at Enterprise facilities.\n"
