A safety inspection is preformed before  product is moved from the storage tank to nurse tanks.  By doing a short walk around inspection of the facility, a person is able to detect any problems before they arise.  If any part of the system showed signs of stress, or if odors were present , corrective measures would be taken to repair the system,  before the facility became a problem.  Employees are trained and schooled so they are aware of the hazards of handling and transfering anhydrous ammonia.  The safety plan also includes a safety drill, whereas employees are exposed to the safe procedures of handling and transfering anhydrous ammonia.  All employees handling anhydrous ammonia are required to comply with all safety measures and rules set  forth by the Farmers Cooperative Elevator.",

A written plan is necessary to keep track of all emergency procedures and provisions.  It is also easier to ensure training is completed and is consistent for all employees when an Emergency Action Plan is in writing.  An Emergency Action Plan must contain emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; description of rescue  and medical duties for those employees who are to preform them; the perfered means of reporting fires and other emergencies; names or regular job titles of person or departments who can be contacted for further information  or explanation of duties under the plan.  The written plan also includes all the MSDS sheets for the products we carry.  The purpose of this business is to buy and sell grain, and to retail other farm related supplies and services, including bulk fuels and anhydrous ammonia.

The visitors log would help the EC in locating these personnel in the event of an emergency.  In the event of an emergency the EC would be able to assemble his employees to the rendezvous point which is north of the scale, which is between the office and the feedmill.  At this time a head count could be taken; this would help the EC in locating personel still missing and also locating personel signed in the visitors log if any.  At this time the EC would be able to secure the area and asign duties; making sure curious onlookers, the press, and unauthorized employees do not enter the dangerous area.  The EC would coordinate outside response, assembling the appropriate personel to take care of the situation.  Once the situation is under control, it is imparative that the same accident does not happen again.  Steps must be taken to correct the problem.

Exposure to high gas concentrations may lead to temporary blindness and severe tissue damage.  Contact with liquid can produce severe frostbite or freezing, chemical burns and blindness.  Exposure to ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with eye disease.\nSKIN:  LIquid solutions and high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can cause blistering or first - and second degree burns.  Rapid evaporation of the liquid and chemical reaction with the skins moisture will cause freezing of the tissue followed by caistic burn.  Severe injuries can be fatal.\nINHALATION:  The odor of ammonia, which can be detected at 1 - 50 ppm, serve as an excellent warning. Accidental exposure to high concentrations (i.e., 400 ppm and above) can cause severe irritation of the respiratory system such as coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, bronchopneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Breathing concentrations of 5,000 ppm has been reported to cause lung inflamation and death by asphyxiation.  Continued exposure to lower concentrations of of the gas cause irritation to mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract and possible damage to the lungs.  Exposure to ammonia may exacerabate symptoms in persons with impared kidney, liver, or pulmonary function.\nINGESTATION:  Can produce corrosion and inflamation of the esophagus, gastritis, abdomin"

Other possible effects are esopheal ulcers that can result in strictures and in gastric duodenal and stenosis.  \nTOXICTY VALUES:   LCLO:  5,000 ppm for humans exposed for 5 minutes by inhalation.\n                                  LC50:  2,000 ppm for rats exposed for 4 - hours by inhalation.\n                                  LD50:  350 mg/kg for rats exposed orally. \nEMERGENCY & FIRST AID PROCEDURES\nEYES:  Hold eye lids open and flush eyes immediately with plenty of water.  Seek medical attention.\nSKIN:  Flush with plenty of water, do not remove contaminated clothing until flushing has begun.\nINHALATION:  Move exposed peerson to fresh air immediately.  If not breathing, give artificial resporation.\nINGESTATION:  If a person is conscious, give large quantities of water and demulcents (e.g.., olive oil, milk or eggwhites  or a mixture of both)  to dilute substance.    DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING....\nNOTE TO PHYSICIAN:  Watch for delayed  symptoms of pulmonary edema.  Treat symptomatically, administering analgesics and corticosteriods as necessary.  If breathing has stopped, surgical intervention (tracheostomy) may be needed to maintain an airway.  Watch for chemical pneumonitis after ingestion or inhalation of fumes. \n\n     All information submitted in this report is true, accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
