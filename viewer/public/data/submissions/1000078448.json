This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of our regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility's Hazmat Teams, Local Fire Department and the Barbour County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled\n\n\n\nEquity Group, Eufaula Division, 57 Melvin Clark Road, Baker Hill, Alabama  is located in a rural area approximately three miles outside of the small town of Baker Hill. Equity Group is responsible for the initial and further processing of poultry products in various varieties.  The facility consists of three separate processing facilities at one location (Fresh, Further and Fresh 2). The facilities use Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed loop refrigeration system as a heat removal media for each processing center.  Both plants operate around the clock, (7) seven days a week.  \n\n\n\nAs a result of a recognized highly toxic chemical used at the Equity Group, Eufaula facility, and in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Program, 40 CFR, Section 68 the facility has developed and implemented the RMP Program 3 requirements.  Additionally the facility also has in place a Process Safety Management program for each ammonia process as required by OSHA Standard 1910.119.  Each process center uses this program as a management system per the outlined requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nHaving three separate ammonia refrigeration system processes, the facility modeled a worst cas"

The RMP COMP models are referenced in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process. \n\n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file with the Equity Group Eufaula Division Environmental Managers office.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of MARPLOT mapping program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\n\nPrevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. The Equity Group Eufaula Division facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\n\n\nEquity Group, Eufaula has integrated various engineering and administrative control mechanisms to eliminate and/or minimize any possible upsets or releases from this facility.

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNo changes to the ammonia refrigeration process are planned at this time.   However, the processes will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements. Facility personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
