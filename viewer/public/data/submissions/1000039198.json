This WWTP (3 MGD) is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Yauco Wastewater Treatment Plant is observing the appropriated engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nYauco Wastewater Treatment Plant is located close to the Yauco River where the plant discharges the treated water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans and contamination of the river.\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Yauco Wastewater Treatment Plant could have a storage maximum volume of 10,000 lbs distributed in five (5) containers.  Two containers are connected to the chlorinators only, one is  in use (40 pounds per day) the chlorine flows to the chlorinator valve through a tubing then dossified, and ends to ejector. The ejector combines  the used water and chlorine solution to complete the desinfection process and discharge. \n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst "

      "SummaryText": "Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 lbs) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 14,963 residents are inside the 1.3 miles radio. Schools, Church, Hospital, commercial are inside downtown and the simulator radio (1.3 miles) includes Yauco downtown.  No known environmental receptors beside the plant (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 lbs container, but throughout a 3/8 inch pipe leak.  In such case the end point distance is calculated as 0.1 miles and no public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually performing maintenance activities to the chlorine system.  The employees perform periodic inspections to the chlorine application system and maintenance procedures are followed which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.
