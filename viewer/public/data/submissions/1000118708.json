The Engineering Manager solicits assistance from other individuals as needed.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nNinth Avenue Foods has developed a Risk Management Program and an Emergency Action Plan to address the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 68, Subpart B, Sections 68.20 to 68.42 (40 CFR \u00a768.20 \u0096 68.42). Ninth Avenue Foods has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered process. Ninth Avenue Foods\u0092 policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nNinth Avenue Foods is located at 6350 S 175 W, Columbus, Indiana 47201 and the regulated substance at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 18,680 pounds [lbs.] and it is stored in a pressurized storage tank. \n\nHazard Assessment Summary / Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary: Per US EPA RMP Regulations, one (1) worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the covered process. The results can be found in the most recent Hazard Assessment documentation. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary: An alternative release scenario was modeled. The results can be found in the most recent Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia ha"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including safeguard intended to mitigate risks in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia. Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe covered process has over the 10,000-lb threshold quantity for US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM threshold quantities. As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to US EPA RMP Program Level 3, and OSHA PSM. The Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractors.

From 40 CFR \u00a768.42(a): \"The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\" There have been no reportable releases of ammonia at Ninth Avenue Foods in the past five (5) years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nNinth Avenue Foods is a non-responding facility and does not train employees for active responses to ammonia releases. The Facility has implemented an EAP that meets the requirements of 40 CFR \u00a768.90(b) and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency. Employees are trained to evacuate and call 9-1-1, and coordinate with the local fire department and first responders. A current copy of the EAP can be found with the Engineering Manager.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe PHA study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations, if any where made, in the PHA report."
