One dissociator is equipped with an automatic shutoff for dangerous conditions, the other two are scheduled to be installed within the next two years.  All three dissociators are equipped with overtemperature alarms.",

      "SummaryText": "    Oneida Silversmiths is a manufacturer of stainless steel and silver plated flatware and hollowware.  The main manufacturing facilities are located in Sherrill, New York and employ approximately 2400 people.  Oneida Silversmiths Main Plant,which is addressed by this Risk Managemgent Plan, produces forks, spoons, serving pieces and hollowware. Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the manufacturing activities.\n\n    Oneida Silversmiths has shown a long-standing concern for protection of the environment and the health and safety of the surrounding community.  Oneida Silversmiths maintains accidental release prevention and emergency release policies at the Main Plant.  For example, designated emergency coordinators are trained to respond in the event of a hazardous material release.  A current spill plan is maintained, and local hospital, police and fire departments are possess a copy of that plan.  An annual chemical inventory that identifies locations of hazardous chemicals on-site, including anhydrous ammonia,  is provided to the New York State Emergency Response Commission, as well as the Local Emergency Response Commission and the Sherrill - Kenwood Fire Department.  \n\n    The worst-case release scenario would  involve the failure of a 9200 gallon capacity anhydrous ammonia storage tank after it has just been filled.  This scenario is considered extremely unlikely because it would only occur in the event of a complete failure of a well-maintained tank system installed in 1991.  If the scenario did occur, however, the release would extend beyond Oneida Silversmiths' Main Plant boundary, and would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.  Administrative controls currently employed to mitigate this scenario include operational procedures which ensure that the storage tank is filled to no more than 86% capacity.\n    If a release were to occur, the alternative release scenario has been determined to be more likely than the worst-case release scenario."

      "SummaryText": " This alternative scenario would involve the failure of a transfer hose during delivery of ammonia.  The estimated amount released in this situation is 462 gallons. The release would extend beyond Oneida Silversmiths' Main Plant boundary and would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.    This scenario would be mitigated by an excess flow valve on the tanker which would close in the event of a hose rupture.\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n    Planned changes to improve safety at the Main Plant include (a) installing secondary containment on the anhydrous ammonia storage tank by December 1999, (b) installation of a water spray system over the anhydrous ammonia storage tank and tansfer area, to reduce ammonia vapors in the event of a leak, and to cool the tank in the event of a fire in an adjacent building.   These changes reflect Oneida Silversmiths' efforts to prevent any releases of hazardous chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental release, we are prepared to take all necessar steps to minimize the effect on both the local community and the environment."
