      "SummaryText": "The Washington County Service Authority (WCSA) operates a 4.6 MGD Water Treatment Plant on Route 58 (Jeb Stuart Highway) approximately 2.5 miles southwest of Abingdon, Virginia. Chlorine is used to disinfect the water. Disinfection is necessary in order to provide a safe, dependable supply of water to our customers in Washington County. The stored amount of chlorine at the Water Treatment Plant may exceed 1500 pounds, requiring the development of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Process Safety Management Plan (PSM). Our RMP has established procedures to prevent or minimize the consequences of a release of chlorine, specifically, with respect to WCSA employees and the public.\nWe take pride in our safety program. Management has committed tools, resources, and support as well as the funding needed to maintain a high level of safety awareness and responsibility. The WCSA Safety Committee has been in place since 1997. This committee is comprised of a representative of each department and meets on a monthly basis to plan safety training, review training programs and conduct site assessments. \nWe also invest resources and energy into quality improvement efforts. Recently the WTP received the Directors Award of Recognition from the Partnership for Safe Water. The Partnership for Safe Water is a program sponsored by AWWA, the AWWA Research Foundation, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, and the National Association of Water Companies. The Partnership is a volunteer initiative for water suppliers committed to the enhancement of drinking water quality and operational excellence in water treatment. This Award was presented to the WTP for successfully meeting extensive criteria and undergoing a rigorous self-assessment and peer review of all its major unit processes including disinfection by chlorine. \nProcess safety management and Risk management are fully complied with b"

      "SummaryText": "y the WTP. In addition to these policies, we maintain a chemical safety program to regularly train our personnel who deal with chemicals or other hazardous materials. This program seeks to ensure that personnel working on or near OSHA PSM and/or EQP RMProgram regulated processes are adequately trained and understand the inherent process hazards and appropriate response actions to accidental chemical releases. A Mechanical Integrity Program is also maintained to ensure the continued integrity of process equipment. We see this program as essential to preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment. Furthermore, an emergency generator has been approved for purchase within the coming year. Anticiapted completion of installation is December 2004.\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\nThe emergency action plan (EAP) developed by WCSA is comprehensive and incorporates emergency response training and drills. The EAP also coordinates with local responders. These local responders have been provided a written copy of the EAP and are given an on-site walk-through of this plan each year to promote preparedness for effective response. We will be creating a written Emergency Response Plan this year.\nA Compliance Audit and Chlorine Safety training is being scheduled for the WTP during the summer. We are also in the process of conducting a Vulnerability Assessment to evaluate susceptibility to potential threats and identify corrective actions to reduce such risks. Through this process we hope to develop more risk reduction options."
