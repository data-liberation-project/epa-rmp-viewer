      "SummaryText": "ssipated, the vapor temperature is lowered to the saturation temperature for the existing tube pressure (discharge pressure).  Upon reaching saturation temperature, the vapor then begins to reject the latent heat of condensation and, in doing so, condenses to liquid at that same saturation temperature and pressure.  As the water sprayed over the surface of the tubes absorbs the heat from the ammonia vapor in the tubes, the water will evaporate carrying away the heat by latent heat of evaporation.  Once the air surrounding the tubes becomes saturated with moisture, evaporation of the water in contact with the tube surfaces will diminish significantly or cease. To ensure continued water evaporation, the condensers' fans continuously replace this moisture laden air by forcing it from the condenser to the outer atmosphere and replace it with fresh air.  Makeup water is also continually supplied.  The rate at which the ammonia vapor is condensed to liquid thereby regulates system discharge pressure.  The system has one evaporative condenser with two coil banks. \n\nThrough system design, all liquid from the evaporative condenser is drained to the High-Pressure Receiver (V-1) to ensure an adequate amount of liquid ammonia is maintained for compressor oil cooling. The High-Pressure Receiver (V-1) supplies liquid to compressor for liquid injection oil cooling and also supplies high-pressure liquid for use in the refrigeration system. The High-Pressure Receiver (V-1) provides makeup liquid ammonia to the +20\u00b0F Medium Temperature Pump Package (V-3) vessel and the -20\u00b0F Low Temperature Pump Package (V-2) vessel. The +20\u00b0F Medium Temperature Pump Package (V-3) vessel provides medium temperature recirculated liquid (MTRL) to all cooler and dock ammonia evaporators in the system.

The Corporate Compliance Team assists the facility in administering safety and environmental policies. The Corporate Compliance Team is made up of the following personnel:\n- Senior Managers of Refrigeration\n- Director of Environmental & OSHA Compliance\nThe Maintenance Manager periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs. These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the C&S Wholesale Grocers Robesonia, PA facility is approximately 25,800 pounds within the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia to provide refrigeration for dock operations, freezer and cold storage\nwarehousing, and an underfloor glycol system.\n\nOff-site Release Scenarios\nC&S has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines,\" and used the EPA's RMP*Comp to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. These data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes. Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release.

Passive mitigation measures were not taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default\nmeteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\nProcess Description\nThe refrigeration system is a two-stage system supporting a medium temperature suction header pressure and low temperature suction header pressure. The screw compressors (RC-1 and RC-2) are swing compressor machines. The compressors take medium temperature suction from the medium temperature suction (MTS) header supplied by the +20\u00b0F Medium Temperature Pump Package (V-3) and discharges to the evaporative condenser if in high side operation. The compressors take low temperature suction from the low temperature suction (LTS) header supplied by the -20\u00b0F Low Temperature Pump Package (V-2) and discharges to the evaporative condenser if in low side operation. There is an economizer side port that is provided by the +20\u00b0F Medium Temperature Pump Package (V-3) vessel. Because of the work of compression, all vapor discharged from the compressors routed to the evaporative condensers is in a superheated state.\n\nEntering the condenser coils, the vapor first rejects the superheat to the water sprayed on the exterior surface of the tubes.  As the sensible superheat is di"

The         -20\u00b0F Low Temperature Pump Package (V-2) vessel receives low temperature recirculated suction (LTRS) returning from all freezer evaporator units. \n\nThe system refrigerating loads utilize medium temperature recirculated liquid and low temperature recirculated liquid overfeed to evaporators.\n\nThe discharge header is equipped with defrost condensate pressure regulators to maintain a constant hot gas defrost header pressure sufficient to support hot gas defrost (HGD) operations.\n\nThe facility's ammonia process system has numerous safety systems, both separate and incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system, including:\n\u0095\tNH3 detection and alarm system\n\u0095\tSafety relief valve and relief vent header system\n\u0095\tMachinery Room ventilation system\n\u0095\tEmergency break-glass shutdown station\n\u0095\tVessel high level alarm and cutout controls for compressor protection\n\u0095\tIncorporated compressor safeties for high and low temperatures and pressures\n\u0095\tEmergency Pressure Control System (EPCS)\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations: \n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.

The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process. The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Robesonia's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.\nThe Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements. It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shutdown if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits. Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled. The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the Facility in the last five years as this facility has not utilized Anhydrous Ammonia prior to 7/24/2024.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.
