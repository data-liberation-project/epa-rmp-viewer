TDI is then pumped from the \"day\" tanks to mixer heads in the intermediate area, reacting and consuming the material. This \"activation\" procedure is controlled through an Inbatch computer control system which will shut down operations and sound an alarm if outside close tolerances.\n\n\n\nBASF has specific standard operating procedures and training in the offloading of tankers to bulk storage. The TDI off-loading SOP specifies that a trained BASF employee wearing proper PPE will be present during the entire offload procedure, including transfer hose hookup, product transfer, offload and during removal of the transfer hose. Any leak or rupture will be observed and proper steps taken to shut down transfer to minimize TDI loss. An isocyanate emergency stop is located at the offload station that automatically stops the offload operation when activated.\n\n\n\nBASF has a comprehensive contingency (emergency response) plan that includes procedures for chemical spills/releases, medical emergencies, natural disasters, and environmental issues.
