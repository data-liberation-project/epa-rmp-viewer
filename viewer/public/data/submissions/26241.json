(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\r\nfarmers and co-ops.\r\n\r\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 18,940,000 pounds in our main storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a barge holding 5,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nButane \r\n\r\nButane is received, stored, and re-distributed under contract with a local refinery.  The maximum quantity stored is 16,742,318 pounds in our storage sphere.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding approximately 41,727 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our main storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 18,940,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 25 miles.  The alternate release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a trans"
