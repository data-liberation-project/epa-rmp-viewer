The RMP program was established to meet and addresses the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance\nThe five year accident history\nThe employee awareness and responder training programs\nThe accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention efforts\nThe emergency response plan and its integration with local emergency response plans\nThe progams to continually improve safety and reduce the risk of accidental releases\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the Wells' Dairy Le Mars Milk Plant's refrigeration system.  Liquid is circulated as needed to the air units, chillers, and freezers, where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium being cooled or frozen.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nThe five year accident history consists of only one incident where two maintenace personnel were exposed to low concentration levels of ammonia during a valve replacement procedure.  One employee used the required personal protective equipment and one did not.  The one wearing the proper PPE did not experience any exposure effects.  The one that was not wearing proper PPE left the work site without expressing any issues with exposure effects, but was later admitted to the local medical facility for respiratory distress and even later died.  The cause of death was not clearly determined to be the result of ammonia exposure due to other health risk factors that the person engaged in during off-work hours.\n\nChemical awareness training is provided for all employees at the facility.  For those employees "

These employees are trained in the use of proper personal protective equipment, incident command, and spill control as well as other emergency response topics.  Periodic skill demonstration drills are conducted throughout the year..\n\nThe accidential release prevention program level 3 is implemented through the process safety management (PSM) program.  Process specific training is provided to all maintenance and operator/mechanic personnel to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the process.  Administrative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention programs can be modified accordingly  The various facets of the PSM program and RMP progarm are linked through documentation and communication.\n\nEmergency response plans for various personnel and chemical emergencies are integrated into an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP documents the processes of emergency response, training, resource management, and data tracking for a wide range of accidents that may occur at this facility.  The ICP also spells out the line authority for personnel that may need to respond to accidents or emergencies.  Training is provided to on-site emergency responders as well as the local fire department personnel that may be asked to assist in the case of an accident.  Company representatives periodically attend the Iowa Region 4 Emergency Planning Committee meetings to interact with committee members and other area industry representatives.\n\nWells' Dairy, Inc. addresses and incorporates recommendations resulting from action items developed from process hazard analysis, offsite consequence, incident investigation, and program audit findings.
