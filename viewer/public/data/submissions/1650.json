IF AN ACCIDENTIAL\n      RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n      OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE \n      TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMWENT.\n\n2.   THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR \n      SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT\n      APPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.\n\n       THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 210,000\n       POUNDS.\n\n3.   THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n      THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A\n      STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED \n      WOULD BE 120,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK\n      AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n      THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.3 MILES.\n\n      THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO  BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A\n      RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.\n\n      THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14/MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS .19 MILES.
