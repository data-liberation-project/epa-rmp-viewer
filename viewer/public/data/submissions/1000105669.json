The new vacuum regulators mount directly on the containers, therefore immediately reducing the pressure in the piping system.  Portions of the manifold which were under pressure were replaced with PVC piping.\n\nFurthermore, the existing chlorinators were replaced with new models designed for a lower capacity.  \n\nIn addition, alternate technologies to replace chlorine entirely are under review."

Such drills include confined space rescue, fire truck exercises, medical scenarios, tabletop scenarios, and personal protective equipment inspection and donning exercises.  One drill addresses a scenario of chlorine being released from a one-ton chlorine container.

Eastman also has procedures to address inclement weather which may affect process operations at the TCO Plant, such as a hurricane or freezing temperatures.\n\nThe TCO Plant has an Emergency Response Plan which establishes responsibilities and requirements for responding to emergencies that might occur at the site.  Each manufacturing department also has emergency operating procedures for the safe operation and/or shutdown of plant operations during an emergency.  Together, and with the use of an Incident Command System (ICS) modeled after the National Incident Management System (NIMS) framework, Eastman provides a systematic and proactive approach to respond to incidents in a manner which reduces injuries, community impact, property damage, and harm to the environment.\n\nThe Incident Command System is the organization of employees who responds to an emergency in various support roles, such as the Incident Commander, Officers, firefighters, medical responders, and Emergency Communications Coordinator.  \n\nEastman also is a member of the Texas City Industrial Mutual Aid System (IMAS), which coordinates mutual response activities between the local industrial community and the City of Texas City.  \n\nThe Emergency Communications Coordinator supports the Incident Commander (IC) by coordinating notifications and communications between the IC, Management, and internal and external resources (e.g. o"

This system helps prevent or minimize the potential consequences associated with a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals at the TCO Plant.\n\nEastman's MOC system includes the conducting of Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) for new facilities and for modified facilities in accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  These PSSRs are conducted to verify appropriate safety information has been updated, required reviews have been performed, and necessary training has been completed.\n\nAn important part of Eastman's accidental release prevention program is its Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program.  A PHA is a study which is conducted by a multi-discipline team of employees to determine the ways in which a chemical process may deviate from the design intent.  The PHA Team consists of well-trained personnel knowledgeable in the technology and operations of the particular unit or process under study.  The PHA Teams make recommendations concerning any issues which they feel warrant some follow-up discussion or action, and Management assigns responsibility to each recommendation.  These recommendations are then tracked to completion based on documented responses from the responsible individuals.  A PHA is revalidated at least every five years to ensure it is consistent with the current process.  The chlorine system has had several PHAs conducted on it so far, and all recommendations resulting from these PHAs have been addressed.\n\nThere are written procedures for the receipt, connection, disconnection, and switching of chlorine containers, as well as for the normal operation of the chlorination system.
