This PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Pacific Diazo Products believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program. Operating level employees, particularly the Distribution Supervisor and the Storage System Operator have been deeply involved, in the development of the Program and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Pacific Diazo Products Storage facility safely.\nThe Pacific Diazo Products Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the San Bernadino Co. Fire Department Hazardous Material Division. All Pacific Diazo Products employees will receive documented emergency response training.\n\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nPacific Diazo Products is a leading Industrial Ammonia Distributing Company in the United States. Refer to Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) document(s), located in the Pacific Diazo Products corporate offices in Colton, CA, for onsite anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide quantities. Anhydrous Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide (aqua ammonia) are the only hazardous materials on site in the storage location in amounts above the threshold quantity.\n\nIII.

Hazardous Materials Division to practice, train and update their Emergency Action Plan.  Pacific Diazo Products conducts triennial PSM/RMP compliance audits of the entire PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  Pacific Diazo Products considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.  Pacific Diazo Products emphasizes and insists on \"employee participation\" from the Ammonia Storage System Operator in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program. Pacific Diazo Products provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia storage system employee.\n\nPacific Diazo Products maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward its neighbors and concerned community citizens. Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request and Pacific Diazo Products? approval.\n\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on or off-site.\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPacific Diazo Products? storage facility employees have been trained evacuate to designated assembly location contingent upon wind direction.  The emergency action plan has been coordinated with the San Bernadino Co. Fire Department Hazardous Material Division Emergency Response Plan.\n\nVII.
