Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt the North Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (NRWWTP) located in Broward County, Florida, chlorine is stored for use for wastewater disinfection.  Chlorination is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  It is management's commitment to safety and adherence to Federal, State, and local rules and regulations that reduce the threat to our employees and nearby members of the community.  Our safety procedures involve the training of our employees in the safe handling of chlorine and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\nOur facility's specific Emergency Action Plan includes notification to the local fire authority.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  At the NRWWTP, the chlorine system exists in an unenclosed building on our property.  The enclosure of the building and the addition of an emergency chlorine scrubber in fiscal year 2000 will help to mitigate a potentially hazardous situation in the event of a chlorine leak within the building.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.\n\nThe primary purpose of the NRWWTP is to handle the wastewater coming in from the customers and treating to a certain level as specified by EPA regulations.  One of the treatment processes included in the wastewater treatment plant is disinfection by chlorine.  The storage capcity of each cylinder is 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  We have a total capacity for 25 cylinders, therefore the maximum amount of chlorine that is stored at our plant is approximatey 50,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s):  \n\nA.  Worst-Case Scenario - After careful review of potential worst-case scenarios, we feel that the largest quantity of a cylinder (2,000 pounds) r"

Alternative Scenario - The connection from the chlorine cylinder to the delivery piping breaks causing a flashing liquid release through a small hole approximately 1/4-inch diameter.  The liquid chlorine flashes immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and is carried downwind.\n\nThe distance to the EPA established endpoint of 3 ppm for the alternative scenario is estimated to be 0.2 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility's boundary.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA's Process Safesty Mangement Standard.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with professional engineering practices to ensure a sate system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  The delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained in regard to chlorine hazards.  Our employees monitor each delivery of chlorine on our site.  In addition, we contract out to chlorine system professionals to periodically inspect our chlorine system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to ensure safe handling and use of chlorine.  We maintain a computer generated preventative maintenance schedule of the chlorine process equipment.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases, injuries, or environmental damage resulting from our chlorine system in the last five years.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's Emergency Action Plan is based upon the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our"
