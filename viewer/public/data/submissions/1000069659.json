This method predicted pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of the pollutant, the physical characteristics of the site, weather conditions, and the circumstance of the release.\r\n\r\nTOLLC field personnel are provided various levels of training dependent on their overall job responsibilities. Specific training programs may include respiratory protection, lockout/tagout procedures, worker right to know/hazard communication standard. Additionally, personnel are knowledgeable as to the characteristics and hazards of the flammable material stored at the facility and any conditions likely to worsen emergencies such as weather or mechanical equipment failure. TOLLC employees are trained in the proper use of chemical extinguishers during the incipient stage of a fire. Routine training will continue to be provided to plant personnel. If in the future, new safety technology relating to the regulated process is developed, installation of such technology will be further evaluated.\r\n\r\nDepending on the situation, procedures to be followed by the discovering employee(s) to mitigate the emergency may include:\r\n\u00bf\tStop the leak/release if it can be DONE SAFELY WITHOUT RISK.\r\n\u00bf\tShut upstream source off\r\n\u00bf\tIf fire has occurred, let ve"
