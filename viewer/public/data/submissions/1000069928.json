This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nThe James Lake Gas Plant, located near Goldsmith, Texas, operates a sour gas processing facility that maximizes liquid recovery and makes pipeline quality gas from wellhead gas produced from various formations in the area.  The James Lake Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as ethane, propane and butane.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The gas plant process is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses the elements of the James Lake Gas Plant's accident prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nThe James Lake Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program."

      "SummaryText": "Process Safety Information:\r\nThe James Lake Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the  gas plant has documented safety-related  limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the James Lake Gas Plant Operating Procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems(e.g., automated  shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical  rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nThe James Lake Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe J"

      "SummaryText": "ames Lake Gas Plant primarily used the HAZOP methodology technique designed for natural gas processing plants to perform these evaluations.  This breaks down the typical HAZOP nodes into smaller equipment/vessels nodes, thereby allowing the PHA Team to evaluate the process in much more detail.\r\nThe analysis was performed by a trained and knowledgeable team of people with operating and maintenance experience, as well as, engineering expertise.  The team identified and evaluated the hazards of the process as well as, accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believed that those.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and re validates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nThe James Lake Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a re"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the James Lake Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator Is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically will be re-certified on the operating procedures to  ensure that their skills and  knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This re-certification is conducted every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood  the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:\r\nThe James Lake Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do In the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
