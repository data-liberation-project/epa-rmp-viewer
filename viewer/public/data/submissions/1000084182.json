      "SummaryText": "Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is establishing Vantage Corn Processors LLC (VCP) as a wholly owned subsidiary, which will include the Cedar Rapids Dry Mill facility.  The effective date for the new subsidiary is January 1, 2020.  The Cedar Rapids Dry Mill has been operating for approximately nine years, and has been a part of the ADM Cedar Rapids Risk Management Plan (RMP) since 2010.\n\nVCP Cedar Rapids strives to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances under the Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nVCP commitment is reflected in our Risk Management Program, as codified in 40 CFR Part 68, and incorporates the following as applicable:\n\n1.    Implementation of a management system, per 40 CFR ?68.15;\n\n2.    Conducting hazard assessments, per 40 CFR ?68.42;\n\n3.    Implementing the prevention requirements, per 40 CFR ?68.87;\n\n4.    Implementing of an Emergency Response Program, per 40 CFR ?68.90-68.95; and\n\n5.    Submittal of Program Elements, per 40 CFR ?68.175.\n\nThe VCP Cedar Rapids facility produces fuel alcohol, corn oil, and DDGS feed.  The fuel alcohol is tainted with denaturant (natural gasoline) prior to shipment.  The natural gasoline contains pentanes and the volume stored onsite is above applicable RMP threshold levels.  Natural gasoline is stored in a storage tank prior to mixing with ethanol.  Emissions from this storage tank are regulated in accordance with VCP's air quality permit established by Linn County Public Health Department, Air Quality Division.\n\nVCP evaluated the accidental release of flammable liquids in accordance with the applicable requirements for worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  To aid in estimating potential offsite impacts from these release scenarios, VCP utilized US EPA's recommended software, RMPComp, to estimate the endpoint radius from the facility.  Having estimated the endpoint radius, VCP applied that value to MARPLOT for identifying the offsite populations and environmental receptors.\n\nA worst-case r"

      "SummaryText": "elease scenario for pentanes has been prepared per 40 CFR 68(f) for Program 3 type evaluations.  For this type of evaluation, the entire contents of a full storage tank are spilled instantaneously forming a liquid pool.  Because pentanes are liquid at room temperature, the 10-minute volatilization rate is estimated by the RMPComp software, assuming the entire contents as pentanes.  Using this conservative estimate, the endpoint radius of a one (1) PSI overpressure is 0.5 mile in any direction.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was prepared for pentane, in accordance with 40 CFR 68.28(a).  To develop the endpoint radius in any direction, active and passive mitigation systems may be incorporated into the estimated value.  A small tank leak (1 square inch) releasing pentane for one (1) hour calculated a one (1) PSI overpressure as <0.1 mile radius around the tank.\n\nHaving estimated potential offsite impacts, the facility does incorporate safeguards for the minimization of accidental releases.  Supported by the various Program 3 requirements, such as Process Safety Information, Process Hazardous Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, etc., the facility continually identifies opportunities for improvement and implementation.  Examples include standardization of design through engineering specifications, review and training on the operating procedures, and increasing our focus and review of recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices through PHA or vendor supplied information.  Opportunities present themselves during mechanical integrity inspections, evaluations, and preventative programs that can be further evaluated with the management of change program.  In addition, VCP Cedar Rapids shares knowledge and experiences with other VCP and ADM facilities.\n\nIn the past five years, VCP Cedar Rapids has not experienced an accidental release from the natural gasoline (pentane) system as defined by 40 CFR ?68.42.\n\nEm"

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan to work with the prevention of and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The facility is also a member of the Linn County Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nAs indicated in previous sections, VCP continues to evaluate and implement changes when identified to improve safety at the Cedar Rapids facility.\n\n"
