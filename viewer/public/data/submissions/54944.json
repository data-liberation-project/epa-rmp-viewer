Maintenance employees engaged in carrying out the mechanical integrity program are trained to complete the required tasks in a safe manner.\n\nOne component of the mechanical integrity program includes inspection and testing of process equipment.  Equipment inspection and testing is conducted in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Records of inspections and testing are maintained to show the date, equipment identification, inspector, type of test or inspection performed, and test results or observations.  If deficiencies are noted during equipment inspection and testing, corrective actions are taken in a timely manner to assure safe operation of the process.  In some cases, equipment inspections are driven by permit requirements as well as the mechanical integrity program.  For example, process pumps are inspected visually on a weekly basis, and quantitatively for leaks on a quarterly basis, in accordance with specific air permit requirements.\n\n3f. Management of Change\n\nOne component of the plant's Process Safety Management (PSM) program is a written procedure for the Management of Change.  Except for replacements in kind, any change to the PSM-covered process requires completion and approval of a Request for Change prior to making the change.  Such changes include new process chemicals, new technologies, new or modified equipment, new or modified operating conditions, and new or modified procedures.  The Request For Change must be reviewed and approved by a team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process, knowledge of the proposed changes, and knowledge of applicable regulatory requirements.  The Request for Change must describe the proposed change and its impact on employee health and safety, the purposes and benefits of the change, the target date for the change to take effect, and whether the change is tempo"

Records of Requests For Change are maintained to track the status and progress of planned changes.\n\n3g. Pre-startup Review\n\nPrior to startup of a new process involving RMP chemicals  and on the plant site, a pre-startup safety review is conducted to ensure that the equipment and installation meets design specifications, a process hazard analysis has been completed, employee training has been completed, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place.  A pre-startup safety review is also conducted for process changes where the approved Request For Change indicates a change in the process safety information is required.  A team of employees having knowledge of the process, equipment, procedures and safety requirements operating conditions conducts the pre-startup safety review, procedures and safety requirements.  All items on the pre-startup review checklist must be satisfied prior to commencing startup.\n\n3h. Compliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits for the process are conducted at least every three years with the last audit being conducted in September 2006 to ensure that the elements of the general accidental release prevention program are up to date and are being implemented.  Personnel having experience and knowledge of the covered processes and knowledge of the program requirements conduct the compliance audits.

A copy of the hot work permit must be displayed at the job location while hot work is in progress, and the permit is maintained on file after the completion of the hot work. \n\n3l. Contractors\n\nPrior to commencing work on plant, each contractor has received prior approval through our procurement group and each contract employee must have attended the Houston Area Safety Training Council training and received site specific safety training.  The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the plant emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of plant safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  Once having attended safety training, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee has received a safety orientation prior to starting work on plant.  Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dis"

The Five Year Accident History: \n \nIn the past five years, there have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage resulting from any releases of any of the RMP chemicals associated with our site. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan:  \n\nThe Baytown plant has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility.  The plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental chemical release.  The Plan provides for both internal plant and external community emergency alerting.  The Plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with LEPC, CIMA, local industry and ECHMA and nearby sister plant in Pasadena.  Annual drills of the plant\u00bfs emergency response system are performed\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nThe Baytown plant completed a process hazard analysis revalidation for the tank farm in 2008.  As a result of these systematic safety reviews, several action items were identified and implemented to improve upon the existing safeguards and to further reduce the potential for accidental release. In 2009, the facility added gas detection and perimeter cameras throughout the plant site.  The process hazard analysis for the RMP chemicals at the Baytown site are reviewed and revalidated every five years."

The maximum capacity of the bulk pressurized storage tank is 60,000 gallons.  Propylene is pumped from the pressurized storage tanks through an enclosed piping system into the production area where it is fed into two reactors in the production process unit.\n\nMixed Pentanes, also called Raffinate, is stored in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  The Raffinate is trucked into the plant and off loaded at the south truck terminal. The Raffinate is sent via closed piping to two sphere tanks (S21 and S22).  This chemical is then sent to Exxon Mobil via pipeline for their production process. \n\nPropane is stored in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the /RMP rule.  Propane comes in with the refinery grade propylene and is recovered through the distillation process on site and then stored in pressurized bullets identified as T11-T14.  The propane is then sent via pipeline to customers. \n\n1,3-Butadiene is stored in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity specified in the RMP Rule.  1,3-Butadiene is sent via pipeline through a metering station to Texas Petrochemicals and sent via closed pipeline to another adjacent facility that borders our north property line.  The 1,3-Butadiene can be stored in Tanks 7 and 8 which are 30,000 gallon pressurized bullet tanks.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Baytown plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.  Also described within each of these elements are associated chemical-specific prevention steps, where applicable.\n\n3a.
