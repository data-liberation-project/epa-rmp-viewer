The Facility Policy\r\n             The management and employees of Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental chemical releases.  The facility has a safety program in place and prevention check-lists to deter any possible equipment failures.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work closely with the local authorities and the local fire department to mitigate any release and to reduce the impact to the local people and environment.\r\n\r\n2.)   The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n             Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. is primarily a retail business for the sale of pesticides, fertilizers, and seeds to the farmer.  The plant also buys grain from the farmer and stores and/or sells grain to other terminals.\r\n             Anhydrous Ammonia is the regulated substance handled at Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc.  It is received by truck, stored, and sold to farmers for crop production nutrients.\r\n             The maximum quantity stored of anhydrous ammonia at Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. would be 210,000 pounds.  This would be stored in the two inter-connected 12,000 gallon storage tanks, two 500 gallon applicators, and twenty-seven 1,000 gallon nurse tanks at an administrative filling limit of 85% of design capacity.  This maximum amount would generally apply during the season from May through June.  The quantity stored during the rest of the year could vary from 0 to the maximum of 210,000 pounds, depending upon inventory availability, early fill programs, or product pricing.\r\n\r\n3.)   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n             Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. follows, to the best of their knowledge, the s"

Also, the management has implemented a safety maintenance program that reviews all major and minor aspects of the storage facilities and equipment.\r\n\r\n4.)     The Five-Year Accident History\r\n               Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. has had no accident history within the past five years.\r\n\r\n5.)     The Emergency Response Program\r\n               Prattville Fertilizer & Grain, Inc. has an emergency response plan in place.  They have recently updated the HAZ/MAT emergency operations plan in coordination with the local emergency services and the local fire department.  They also provide the state and local authorities with the community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  All employees are trained in the proper response plan in the event of an emergency and how to work effectively with local emergency responders.\r\n\r\n6.)      Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n               Safety improvement is a continual process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  After recent review, there are no new mitigation plans at the present time.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\n\r\n1.  RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance\r\n2.  RMP Comp\r\n3.
