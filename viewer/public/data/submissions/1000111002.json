Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of Carroll Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia.  If an accident should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Lanark Fire Department, Carroll County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 24751 ILLINOIS RTE 52, is storage and sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of two 30,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  \r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 740,000 pounds, this does  include the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\r\n\r\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPAA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111, A\u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous AmmoniaA\u00bf.  Compliance with these  regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident program.\r\n\r\n4. Five year accident history.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n-Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n-To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deat"

The maximum pounds that can be stored is 4000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the nurse tanks entire contents released as a gas over 90 minutes.
