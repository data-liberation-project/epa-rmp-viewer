This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny RefineryComplex has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process\u001especific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF.  Contractors\r\n\r\nSweeny RefineryComplex uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished, by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Sweeny RefineryComplex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodica"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Sweeny RefineryComplex maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the Root Cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years in order for reports to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSweeny Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs, and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nII.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSweeny Refinery consists of four major facilities, which are linked by multiple pipelines and operates as a single unit. The main plant, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. We also operate terminals and storage facilities in Freeport, Jones Creek, and San Bernard, along with the pipelines that connect these facilities to the main plant and its markets. The refinery covers approximately 3,000 acres at the four locations, the plant processes 213,000 barrels per day of crude oil and produces 115,000 barrels per day of gasoline. In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant, offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  HF Acid, Chlorine, Ammonia-anhydrous \n\nFlammables: 1-Butene; 1-3-Butadiene; 2-Butene; 2-Butene-trans; 2-Butene-cis; 2-Pentene; 2-2-Dimethylpropane; 3-Methyl-1-Butene; Acetylene (ethyne); Butene; Ethane; Ethylene; Hydrogen; Isobutane; Isopentane; Isoprene; Methane; Normal Butane; Pentane; Propadiene; Propane; Propylene; Vinyl Acetylene (1-Buten-3-yne); \n\n\nIII.

Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario.  The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure and that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The ARS represents a more credible, but still significant, accidental release of regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS.  However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may have not been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios.  In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. was considered. \n \n\nNote:  For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios has been removed from Executive Summary.\n\n\nIV.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSweeny Refinery Complex has a long\u001estanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs,  and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.

HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite effects of releases of regulated hazardous substances.  Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario.  The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure and that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The ARS represents a more credible, but still significant, accidental release of regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS.  However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may have not been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios.  In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. was considered. \r\n \r\n\r\nNote:  For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios has"

This maximum quantity was derived from an engineering review of the process. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for either active or passive mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for HF Acid (0.016 mg/t) for this WCS is 14 miles (calculated using EPA\u00bfs RMPComp). This scenario has offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nThe alternate\u001ecase scenario (ACS) associated with toxic substances is a flange leak of HF Acid in the same process area listed for the WCS. Under the ACS, approximately 764 lbs of HF Acid released over a period of 10 minutes. Credit for active mitigation was taken into account in evaluating this scenario, including water spray/deluge systems, rapid acid transfer system, process and audible alarms/operator intervention, etc. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for BF Acid (0.016 mg/1) for this ACS is.3 miles (calculated using EPA's RMPComp). This scenario has offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nThe WCS associated with flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving 2,845,893 lbs of normal pentane from a storage tank in the Refinery Tank Farm. This WCS assumes the entire inventory of this vessel is released, vaporizes and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.
