All plant configuration, operations and emergency response practices are managed using company standard operating procedures.\n\nQuality System (QS)\nStandard operating procedures for all production and related services are managed using an ISO 9001 certified Quality System. The Quality System is certified. \n\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\nAll environmental program procedures are included in an Environmental Management System that achieved certification under the ISO 14001 Standard. The RMP is a program procedure under the EMS. \n\nHealth and Safety Management System (HSMS)\nAll Health and Safety written programs are already installed and controlled using the Management Systems same processes as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 programs.\n\nPolicy\nChemTreat is well aware that our business requires the management of certain hazardous chemicals, which if not properly controlled, introduce increased potential for harm to employees, the community and the environment. Accordingly, we have established systematic procedures to evaluate potential risks, establish procedures to manage those risks on a priority basis, and review and update our programs as conditions or capabilities change. ChemTreat is committed to compliance with all regulatory and other requirements and uses a formal review process including internal and external auditing and inspection to assure the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of all compliance programs.\n\nFacility And Regulated Substances\nChemTreat's plant in Ashland, Virginia is a small blending facility of industrial water treatment chemicals for use in boilers, cooling systems, and wastewater systems.

Chemicals are blended in a batch process into ChemTreat products which are distributed directly to customers. The only regulated substance under the RMP rule used at the facility is cyclohexylamine. \n\nCovered Process\nThe scope of the RMP covered process is limited to transfer and storage of cyclohexylamine in bulk storage tank. No other processes occur where as threshold quantity of cyclohexylamine is managed.\n\nPrevention Program\nChemTreat takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of an accidental release prevention program including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation. These individual elements of our operating procedures work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. ChemTreat employees integrate these management systems into the way we do business and establish specific accountability for accident prevention into our process.\n\nSafety Information\nRisk identification begins early in the product stewardship process when every new raw material proposed for addition to process use is evaluated to determine the potential hazards of the material, compatibility with existing process components and all applicable regulatory constraints. The requirements to manage the risks associated with any new hazardous materials are determined and all necessary configuration changes, program procedure updates and employee training are completed prior to introduction of the new material into the process. \n\nHazard Review\nIn accordance with Section 68.50 of the RMP rule, we use hazard reviews to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards. The most important products of our reviews are recommendations for re"

Procedures are maintained under the various management systems programs. \n\nTraining\nIn accordance with Section 68.54 of the RMP rule, we train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks. Our training program includes initial training as well as refresher training.\n\nMaintenance\nIn accordance with Section 68.56 of the RMP rule, we maintain our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and we ensure that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly. \n\nCompliance Audits\nIn accordance with Section 68.58 of the RMP rule, we conduct compliance audits to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the RMP rule. \n\nIncident Investigations\nIn accordance with Section 68.60 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that all incidents are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no releases or incidents involving cyclohexylamine from the covered process that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nChemTreat is included in the Hanover County Emergency Planning Commission's community emergency response plan.
