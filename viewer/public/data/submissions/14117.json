      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nBrookshire Brothers Ltd. is a grocery retail company with its own Distribution Center. The Distribution Center includes a frozen food, fresh meat and ice plant refrigerated freezer warehouse. Also a dairy, produce, egg, and bakery products refrigerated perishable warehouse. Both facilities have large industrial refrigeration systems that use anhydrous ammonia. We have on site the minimum quantity, of ammonia, needed to operate our refrigeration system. But we still exceed the specified threshold quantity. Therefore we are in full compliance OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP. \nOur refrigeration process is a very basic system that is highly maintained by an excellent qualified staff. The refrigeration department has on going training on refrigeration systems and safety. The freezer facility is six years old and was built with the best refrigeration technology available. The system has four compressors, three recirculating vessels, a thermosyphon vessel, an evaporative condenser, twenty evaporators and two ice machines. The perishable facility was originally built nineteen years ago with a remodel done to the refrigeration system five years ago. The system has three compressor, three accumulators, and one constant pressure vessel, a pilot receiver, an evaporative condenser, forty-eight evaporators and a glycol chiller. The mechanical integrity of these systems is constantly monitored and repaired or replaced as needed.\nThe Brookshire Brothers Distribution Center takes pride in their safety and sanitation programs. The refrigeration department and equipment is a focus point of the safety department therefore we fell the integrity and efficiency stays at 100%."
