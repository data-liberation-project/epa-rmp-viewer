This is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident \nprevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, \noperation, and maintenance of our processes. While prevention is our goal, if a release \ndoes occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nVastar\u0012s Grand Chenier Gas Plant, located in Grand Chenier, Louisiana, operates a \nvariety of processes to extract natural gas liquids from natural gas. The plant has \nhydrocarbon mixtures containing regulated flammable substances including methane, \nethane, propane, n-butane, iso-butane, n-pentane, and iso-pentane. The plant does not \nhave threshold quantities of any regulated toxic substances. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is failure of a 120,000-gallon storage tank containing \nnatural gas liquids (NGL) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). Based on the TNT \nequivalency method contained in EPA\u0012s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, \nthe WCS would impact public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) is a VCE resulting from the release of 18,400 \ngallons of NGL, which is the normal inventory of the 120,000-gallon storage tank. (The \nNGL storage tanks are almost never filled to capacity.) Based on flash formation factors \nfrom EPA\u0012s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and a yield factor of 0.03, the \nARS would impact public receptors. While vapor cloud explosions are generally \nconsidered unlikely events, this ARS is more likely than the WCS and satisfies the ARS \nrequirement o"

As such, it represents a more practical \nscenario for emergency planning.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. \nBecause processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection \nAgency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management \n(PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and \ndescribes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention \nprogram.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of \nprocess safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee \nparticipation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical \ninformation to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. \nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident \nprevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident \nprevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is \nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. \nIn addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process \nsafety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include an area safety committee \nto promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from \nvarious areas of the plant, including operations and maintenance. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant  keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to \nhelp maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical \nproperties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific \nchemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration inform"

The \nManagement of Change process insures process safety information is kept up to date. \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ \nexposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nThis information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known \ncorrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of \nchemicals. Plant specific operating procedures contain safety-related limits for specific \nprocess parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The gas plant ensures that \nthe process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring \ninstruments, highly trained personnel, and safety systems.\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information \nabout the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes \nmaterials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating \nof equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained \npersonnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as \nwell as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety \nfeatures in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that \nhazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this \nprogram, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that \nadequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant primarily uses checklists to perform these evaluations. \nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and \nmaintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

The \nGrand Chenier gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment \npurchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended \nuse and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant uses the Vastar Resources safety and health manual as a \nguideline to help ensure worker and process safety. The safety manual contains \nminimum safety standards for the following operations  (1) fire and safe work permits, \n(2) lockout/tagout, (3) tagging & flagging, (4) blinding (5) vessel & confined space entry, \n(6) excavating & trenching, (7) inservice welding and hottapping. These procedures, \nalong with training of personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and \nmaintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage all non-like-kind \nchanges within the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such \nas process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), \nprocedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before \nbeing implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in \nplace to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been \ncompromised by the change.

Implementation of mitigation \noptions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the \nPHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the \nhighest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to \nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each \nfinding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually \ndeviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically \nupdates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are \nconducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the \nprocess is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are \ndocumented and retained. Once again, the team findings are resolved by local \nmanagement, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes \nof process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary \noperations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a \nnew process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators \nand provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are \nperiodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures \nare kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made \nthrough the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Grand Chenier gas \nplant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all emplo"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations. \nAfter successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior \noperator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., \nthrough tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties \nand tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all \noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure \nthat their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher \ntraining is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each \noperator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Grand Chenier gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during \nperiods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors \nwork on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure \nthat contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate \nknowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand \nwhat they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety \nrules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) safety orientations , (2) pre-job \nsafety meetings, and (3) a work permitting system. In addition, the Grand Chenier gas \nplant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to the selection of a \ncontractor.
