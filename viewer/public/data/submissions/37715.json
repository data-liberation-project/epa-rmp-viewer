(Zillah) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of ammonia releases.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah)  emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees. We have trained the refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\nAt Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\u00b7\tPrevent unnecessary human exposure\n\u00b7\tReduce the threat to our personnel\n\u00b7\tReduce the threat to the community\n\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 1151 Cutler Way Zillah, WA  98953.  The facility is located in Yakima County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere is 14,728 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130"

To this effect, Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n \n \nD.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) accidental release prevent program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00b7\tHigh level of training of personnel\n\u00b7\tPreventative maintenance program\n\u00b7\tWritten safety procedures and safety equipment\n\u00b7\tUse of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) also complies with: \n\u00b7\tOSHA\u00bfs and Washington State\u00bfs process safety management rule.\n\u00b7\tWashington State\u00bfs safety regulations (WAC\u00bfs 296-24 and 296-62), which are equal to, or more restrictive than OSHA regulations.\n\u00b7\tIIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practices.\n\u00b7\tThe Uniform Fire Code for handling of hazardous materials.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. (Zillah) utilizes include:\n\u00b7\tComputerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\u00b7\tSuction trap hi-level float\n\u00b7\tHigh discharge pressure shut down\n\u00b7\tLow suction pressure shut down\n\u00b7\tHigh discharge temperature shut down\n\u00b7\tOil pressure failure shut down\n\u00b7\tHigh amperes shut down\n\u00b7\tAutomatic timer to prevent short cycling\n\u00b7\tOil filters plugged shut down\n\u00b7\t250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\u00b7\t150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\n\u00b7\tEmergency ventilation\nOperating Procedures have been prepared by Inland-Joseph Fruit Co.

These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\n\nSafety orientation includes making all employees aware of the evacuation plan and/or the shelter in place plan.  The supervisors are provided with the contact numbers for our own emergency responders James Schibig and Mario Gallegos to coordinate either the evacuation or the shelter-in-place program.   \n\nRefrigeration personnel have received 24-hour Emergency responder training and the 8 hr. Emergency response team refresher in accordance with 1910.120.  The refrigeration specialists James Schibig and Mario Gallegos have been through the Ammonia Emergency response training conducted by PM Hazmat and Doubl-Kold.  \nDale Dougherty, HR and John Hunsaker, Facilities have also been through the same ammonia response training\n\nWe have two windsocks located at either end of the plant on top of the building and are visible from indoor refrigeration office and also visible outdoors upwind of any potential release.  \n\nG.\tPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.
