      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1  INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nWelcome to Seafreeze Cold Storage. As you can tell from our name, part of our business deals with cold storage. To keep the millions of pounds of product that are stored here frozen, we use Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant. Since we use over 10,000 pounds of ammonia, we actively participate in two major government programs to safely control its use.  Their primary function is dealing with safety and emergency response. The first program is Processes Safety Management (PSM) from OSHA. It deals with how we handle ammonia inside our facility on a day to day basis. The second program is Risk Management Program (RMP) from the EPA. In the event of an ammonia release, RMP is a tool that responding government agencies use to access information about our facility so that they can protect themselves and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nSeafreeze Cold Storage and its three seafood processing tenants employ approximately 300 members of our community. Although they are our primary concern, they are not our only concern. We realize that Ammonia is a hazardous substance and must always be handled in such a way as to prevent any release to the building, environment or the surrounding community. We do not take this responsibility lightly. Seafreeze continues to invest (not just spent) money and time to comply with PSM and RMP. They are not small programs. These programs are not set up and forgotten, but constantly reviewed, updated and implemented. They are part of our day to day operation. It makes the quality of life better for all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2   WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario does not deal with how a full release happens or with the likelihood that it may or may not happen. It deals only with the idea that it could and if it did, what is the affected area. \n\n\n\nIn our case, a full release in ten minutes would be 14,900 pounds of ammonia, the amount that our largest hi-pressure receiver can hold. Under normal operating conditions, t"

      "SummaryText": "his receiver contains approximately 5900 pounds. But since it is impossible to guarantee that this ?full? condition (which in itself does not constitute a danger of release) could not exist, we must treat it as a possibility. Hence the term ?worst case scenario?. Using the E.P.A.?s RMP Comp software, we have determined using wind, temperature, humidity and topography the affected area around Seafreeze would be 2.5 miles. Outside this radius or ?toxic end point? represents an exposure level, according to the EPA, that is believed a person could be exposed to for one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible health effects that could impair that person?s ability from taking protective action. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThe alternative release deals with the type of situation that would normally be expect to cause a release, such as a broken pipe or valve. For our scenario, we examined the affect a half-inch hole from a broken valve stem on a pipe from the condenser at 125 psi would have. A release of this nature running for 10 minutes before it was secured, would have a toxic end point of  844 feet,  or sixteen one hundredths of a mile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nIn order to prevent a worst case or alternate case scenario from happening, we have over 13 prevention programs in operation. These range from doing a Process Hazard Analysis of the entire refrigeration system, which looks for and corrects possible causes of a release, to obvious programs like Training and Lock-Out Tag-Out. Contractors doing work on our system even have their company?s safety programs reviewed and welding certifications checked.  The City of Seattle licenses our 4 refrigeration maintenance employees for Ammonia. Training, testing, program reviews are done at minimum, annually. As an added back up, an outside consultant is hired to do a complete audit of all our programs to ensure that we are doing it right.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5  FIVE YEAR AC"

      "SummaryText": "CIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the last five years (6-04 to 6-09), Seafreeze Cold Storage has had no recordable releases. A recordable release is defined as causing any one of the following. Property damage, injury, death, evacuation, sheltering in place or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is activated by the ammonia detection system or first awareness of ammonia release by a Seafreeze employee. This awareness is communicated to the maintenance department by person, building phone, cell phone or hand held radio. Using written and practiced procedures, an assessment is made as to the severity of the release. Above 250 Parts per Million (PPM) of ammonia and the building is evacuated along with calling 911 to alert the Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Team. Surrounding businesses can also be contacted to inform them of the release with instructions to evacuate or shelter in place. If the ammonia detector indicates below 250 PPM the area is ventilated and needed repairs are performed by Seafreeze Refrigeration technicians.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia detectors are connected to our off-site 24-hour alarm monitoring company. Electrical power for the alarm monitoring computer for our ammonia detection systems, refrigeration equipment and fire systems are backed-up by batteries and an automatic standby generator. After normal business hours, the alarm company contacts one of 4 maintenance employees that are trained to operate the refrigeration system. This employee responds to the alarm to make the initial assessment as to what should happen next. \n\n\n\nSeafreeze conducts evacuation drills twice a year involving all personnel on site. The Seattle Fire Department conducts an annual inspection of our facility. The Seattle Fire Departments Hazardous Materials Response Team has toured our facility. At the end of the tour, the team made recommendations that have since been implemented.  Seafreeze has traveled to the Response Team to discuss re"
