      "SummaryText": "Facility Accidental Release Policy\nThe owners, management and employees of UAP Northwest, 2624 Rd. \"N\" NE, Moses Lake, WA are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity at UAP Northwest is the storage and sale of fertilizer.  For this RMP, a non-hazardous fertilizer is produced from a mobile reactor.  The substance(s) that are occasionally stored at this facility would be Anydrous Ammonia at or above the threshhold level for the RMP.  Anyhdrous Ammonia is received via rail car and reacte with Phosphoric Acid to produce ammonia polyphosphate fertilizer.  This end product is considered non-hazardous.  This fertilizer is utilize for land application in crop production.  The reactor utilized in this process is not the property of UAP Northwest.  It is a private company that travels with this equipment to various state providing service for retail fertilizer locations.  No employee of UAP Northwest are involved in this processing.  The sole reason the regulated substance is on UAP Northwest property is for the purpose of making this non-hazardous end product fertilizer.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternate Release Scenerio\nThe worst-case release scenerio for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car release as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest rail car at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.  The alternate release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the m"

      "SummaryText": "ost likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimate to release 11,908 pounds over a release duration of 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has developed a written Emergency Contingency Plan.  The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1919.120, EPA 40 CFR part 264, subpart D and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - FRP - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements with in this plan include employee training.  SARA Title III reporting requirements and Community Right-To-Know pre emergency planning and emergency response information.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nthe users of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc (ANSI K61.1); California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"' and the standards of the U.s. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of anydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have resulted in off-site deathis, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility, and by the owner of the reactor.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia rail cars or processes at the facilty."
