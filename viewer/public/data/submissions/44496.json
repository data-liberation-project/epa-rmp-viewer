This plan is intended to prevent and minimize the impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide inventories exceed the threshold quantities established in the Risk Management Plan Program (RMP) requirements.\n\nThe Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for chlorination and de-chlorination (disinfection) respectfully, of plant effluent.  The use of these chemicals is subject to the provisions of the RMP requirements, due to their \"above-threshold\" quantities.  \n \n\n\nPhysical Address:    Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant\nNE 1/4 of SW 1/4 of Section 36,\n        Township 19 North, Range 12 East of I.M. in Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma\n            Latitude:    36.08582A?N\n                       Longitude:    95.99189A?W\n\n\n\nMailing Address:    Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant\n5300 South Elwood\nTulsa, OK. 74107\n\n\n\nThis plan consists of the requirements outlined by the RMP requirements and are as follows:\n\nHazard Assessment\nWorst Case Scenario\nAlternative Release Analysis\n\nPrevention Program Three\nManagement System\nEmployee Participation Plan\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedure\nTraining\nContractor Safety\nPre-startup Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Planning and Response\nCompliance Audits\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nOn June 13, 2005 at approximately 9am, the maintenance department responded to an alarm from the safety detection system in the chlorine evaporator room.  In the course of finding the leak, it was determined that a valve did not isolate the system and a small quantity of residual chlorine in the piping was released when testing the system.  The system was worked on for 5.5 hours an"

He has experienced no problems since.  The leak was contained in the evaporator room and no offsite impacts occurred.    No offsite responders were notified because of the small quantity released.  It was determined that a block assembly that was previously added was bad when installed.  There were no process changes resulting from this incident.  Personnel were counseled on the proper use of SCBAs and the leaking parts were replaced.  \n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that the Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains up-to-date and complete written emergency action plans (EAPs) and effective response capabilities for all covered processes.  Comprehensive emergency action plans, when combined with emergency response training and drills, can effectively minimize the impact of an accidental release by ensuring proper and quick facility response.  A summary of the requirements as outline in this section is as follows:\n\n* This facility shall investigate each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release.\n* This investigation shall be initiated promptly, no later than 48 hours following the incident.\n* The guidelines and reports included herein shall be followed for each incident.\n* All affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings shall review the findings.\n* Investigation summaries shall be retained for five years.\n\n\n\nKey Personnel in Plant Implementation\n\nContact\nPosition\nElement\nPhone Number\nBrian Bolte\nSupport Services Manager\nOverall Responsibility:\nRMProgram Manager\nOffice: 918-596-9870\nHome: 918-241-6428\nAndrew Lankford\nSouthside Plant Acting Supervisor\nAlternate RMProgram Manager\nOffice: 918-369-5961\nHome: 918-698-0908\nTim Doering\nMaintenance Supervisor\nMaintenance Procedures\nOffice: 918-591-4466\nHome:  918-371-9767"
