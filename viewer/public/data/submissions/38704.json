Pactiv has aggressive environmental and safety goals. Corporate EH&S personnel assist facilities in developing programs to meet these goals. The Glens Falls facility has an EH&S Manager to coordinate safety and environmental programs.\n \nThis commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operation, maintenance and training for processes at the Glens Falls facility.  In the event any unforeseeable release might still occur, the facility coordinates emergency response primarily with local fire departments. The Warren County LEPC is also made aware of our storage of flammable substances.\n \n2. GLENS FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n \nThe Glens Falls facility manufactures packaging materials including padded mailers, polyethylene foam in the form of sheets and planks and polyethylene bubble. The foam process uses a regulated flammable gas as a blowing agent. The maximum inventory at the facility exceeds the 10,000-pound RMP threshold.\n \n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nThe Glens Falls facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements contained in 40CFR part 68. In addition, the Glens Falls foam process is subject to the requirements of 29CFR1910.119. The facility has also submitted a Title V air permit application. The elements of the Glens Falls program follow closely those contained in the PSM regulation. A brief description follows:\n \nProcess Safety Information\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis\nIn order to identify and then control the hazards of the process, the"

The hazard review is updated at least every 5 years or when major changes are made. The findings are addressed in a timely manner and documented.\n \nOperating Procedures\nTo ensure the covered process is operated safely, written operating instructions are developed, maintained, and made readily available to operators. These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, shutdown, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and emergency operation.\n \nTraining\nThe Glens Falls facility trains employees that operate the covered processes initially, as changes are made and refresher training is conducted at least every three years. Training records are maintained.\n \nMechanical Integrity\nThe Glens Falls maintenance personnel perform documented maintenance on covered process equipment to ensure proper operation. A list of critical equipment with required test frequencies is maintained. Identified deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner. The work is performed by trained maintenance personnel. Equipment covered includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n \nManagement of Change\nWritten Management of change procedures are followed, covering changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Operating and maintenance personnel affected by changes made aware of the changes and retrained as needed.\n \nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nThese reviews are conducted f"
