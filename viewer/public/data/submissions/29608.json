      "SummaryText": "Ultra Dairy Garelick Farms operates a dairy manufacturing facility near Delhi, NY. At this facility, we manufacture and store milk products to be distributed to  stores, restaurants and other customers.\n\nLike most dairy manufacturing facilties, we use anhydrous\nammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nUltra Dairy Garelick Farms is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119), Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) Regulations this facility has prepared a  EPA-RMP Program, as well as performing air dispersion modeling and off-site consequence analysis.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our EPA RMP program includes\nelements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\npoints in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\nrefrigeration system to identify the\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established establishing a\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\nof the re"

The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is\nprescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the\nlikelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents. \n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of a\nhigh-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes. As required, this\nscenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia\nis reached beyond the property line. \n\nThe alternative scenario involves a leak from a relief valve which would have an off site \nimpact. We estimated that the release would end after 20 \nm"
