              "Description": "The capacity of the two, 1,3-Butadiene,  pressurized storage tanks located at the Akron Polymer Plants's adjoining facility, known as Plant 5, are each 23,900 gallons.   One tank is filled and used at a time, while the other tank is either maintained or left empty.  Both of these tanks are in water filled dikes.  The maximum amount of 1,3-Butadiene on site at any one time is less than 120,000 pounds.   Each of these tanks is equipped with a pressure relief valve  ( for accidental overfilling, overpressurization, etc); an air-operated, fail close,  ball valve ( for isolation of the tank from the process); an automated fill valve; and other associated manual valvesand piping systems.  The relief valve and the vent valves are connected to a flare to burn any vapors that would be released.  There are also 2 isolation valves in the feed line between the tank and the plant process.  These valves close and isolate the line automatically in the event the pressure drops below a preset value in the charge line.  Around the tanks, there are  several hydrocarbon detectors that activate alarms in the plant office, to notify the supervisor that there is a potential problem.  The supervisor can activate the isolation valves from his office and from the reactor area to stop the flow of the 1,3-Butadiene, and then start an investigation.  All these safety systems allow for a very safe delivery of 1,3-Butadiene to the process for use.  Inside the facility many other automatic systems are in place to prevent releases of material into the plant and outside environment.  The process is monitored monthly (by an independent monitoring company)  and maintained to prevent even minor leaks from escalating into more substantial releases.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Akron Polymer Plant are strongly committed to associate, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and associate training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Akron Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Production of SBR Paint, Toner and Reinforcing Resins.  The one regulated substances at our facility, 1,3-Butadiene is used as a raw material for the preparation of these SBR resins.\n\nThe maximum inventory of 1,3-Butadiene at our facility is 120,000 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA and the on-line EPA program RMP COMP have been employed by our facility to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a Butadiene Storage Tank -  in the Tank Farm process.  The scenario involves the release of 120,000 lbs. of 1,3-Butadiene.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have "

      "SummaryText": "been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.39 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.    One alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a Butadiene Storage Tank -  in the Tank Farm.  The release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 30,240 lbs. of Butadiene in 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.11 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
