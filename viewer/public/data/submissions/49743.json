      "SummaryText": "REGULATED SUBSTANCE AND STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nVinyl Acetate is a raw material that is used in manufacturing adhesives and sealants at Henkel Corporation's Plant in LaGrange, GA and it is listed in 40CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance.  An inadvertent accidental release of vinyl acetate to the atmosphere may reach public receptors surrounding the facility.  Vinyl acetate is heavier than air and seeks low areas.  It is a colorless gas and impacts public health when inhaled above the toxic end point as defined within 40 CFR 68.22\n\nHenkel Corporation uses vinyl acetate monomer as a reactant with other raw materials to make latex polymer emulsions.  This stationary source is the process that polymerizes one or more monomers in an atmospheric, batch reactor.  The reaction is controlled by the rate of catalyst and activator added, and by controlling the reactor temperature.\n\nVinyl Acetate is stored in a tank farm outside the process building and is pumped to the reactor located inside the process building.  The storage tank is 7,500 gallons capacity and is enclosed with a secondary containment structure that holds the total contents of the tank.\n\nMaximum inventory is 7,500 gallons or 58,000 pounds and exceeds EPA?s threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds.\n\n\nPREVENTION OF VINYL ACETATE RELEASE\n\nThe process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety Information that is a part of Process Safety Management (PSM).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle vinyl acetate, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling and operating procedures that we use, and training of our personnel.  Prevention Program 3 (PSM) as described in 40 CFR Part 68 is followed to accomplish these goals and will minimize the potential for an unplanned release of vinyl acetate to the environment.\n\nFIVE YEAR "

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDespite the Prevention Program, incidents may still occur.  An Emergency Response Program is in place to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release, thereby protecting the public health and the environment.\n\nEmployee training is conducted as follows:\n*HAZWOPER\n*Hazard Communication\n*Process Safety Management\n*Hazardous Waste Generator\n*Employee Safety Briefings\n*Hazmat\n\nIn addition, the Plant works with community emergency responders (LaGrange Fire Department) to ensure that they are suitably trained and drilled in emergency response for vinyl acetate release.  The HAZWOPER Emergency Response Plan is included in Appendix D.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR IMPROVED SAFETY\n\nThe Polymer Process Plant was constructed in 1984.  The facility complies with latest codes and standards that are applicable to this industry.  We continue to modify our operations to improve safety."
