The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties.  ABR also has temporarily suspended delayed coking operations and several storage tanks containing flammable mixtures in Area 3, which is not adjacent to Areas 1 and 2.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Area 3.\r\n\r\nThe RMP for Areas 1 and 2 was last fully updated and re-submitted in December 2012.  Certain equipment in Areas 1 and 2 was de-inventoried and has been temporarily suspended prior to the latest RMP update and does not currently contain any RMP-regulated substances.  However, since the equipment in other previously operated Area 3 units has not been demolished and/or removed, CalARP requested ABR to include the de-inventories units that may contain RMP-regulated substances in the RMP under the predictive filing provisions and maintain the units in current status with all PSM elements in place.  This RMP update fulfills this request.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the risk management program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific regulated substances that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  Regulated substances are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA.  ABR has quantities of various regulated substances above the threshold amounts.  \r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\r\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at ABR\r\nSect"

The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walkthrough was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company for Shell, the previous owner.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having offsite consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.
