The facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of UAP Distribution Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should and accidental release occur, the facility has orientated and is prepared to work with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee, or other authorities, so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The Primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutirent. The maximum quantity stored would be 432,208 pounds in the facility's 1 bulk storage tank and onsite nurse tanks.\n\n3. Accidental release program: The facility complies with the rule and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia equipment, containers and storage facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History: On November 10, 2003 an employee an employee recived an eye injury when he attempted to bleed the N-Serve hose that was connectted to a anhydrous ammonia nurse tank. A small amount of ammonia scaped from the valve and this presure caused the small hose that was attached to the valve to strike the employes goggles jarring them loose which allowed a small amount of ammonia to get into the employees eyes. As a result of this situation the hose attached to the bleeder valve has been lengthened and secured to the N-serve hose so it cannot move seperately.  \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 2"

Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning. Employees also receive pre-emergency planning and training.                  \n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance and safe practices performed at the facility. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
