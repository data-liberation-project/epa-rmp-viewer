Every 3 years, a compliance audit is performed to verify that the prevention program in place is effective and addresses safety issues. An audit team is assembled that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and process design. The audit team evaluates the prevention program to determine if it meets the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68. The results of the audit are documented, action items are generated, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, special measures and safety features specific to ammonia have been implemented at Mosaic to prevent accidents or releases. The ammonia bullets on site are visually inspected monthly and tested for thickness at appropriate intervals. The valves on the ammonia bullets piping are designed and maintained in accordance with good engineering practices established by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All ammonia lines are inspected for mechanical integrity at regular frequencies. All ammonia pressure relief valves are also maintained per API and ASME good engineering practices. Preventive maintenance is performed on all process equipment to ensure safe continuous operation. Mosaic maintains an ammonia relief vent flare system that contains a self-igniter. These are just some of the measures which help Mosaic safeguard the employees, public, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\nRiverview has established a written emergency response program to help ensure the safety of personnel who respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The safe work practices provide for control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, line or equipment opening, and control of entrance into the covered process. The hot work permit program was developed to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions. During development, the OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements were reviewed and a hot work permit form was created in order to comply with these requirements. Employees who perform hot work are required to complete the form and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form and work area before work can begin. Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in the site safe work practices orientation and annual refresher training.\n\n10. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nAll proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures are evaluated in order to ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program. This ensures the following:\nInadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented\nSafety consequences of changes are addressed\nAffected process safety information and procedures are updated\nAffected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n11. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nRiverview investigates incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. Employees receive training on how to identify and report incidents requiring investigation.

Contract supervisors are made aware of the hazards of all processes that contractors are assigned to as well as safe work practices, and emergency response procedures. Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for all employees prior to beginning work at the Riverview facility. \n\n7. PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\nNew or recently modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases. In order to circumvent these occurrences, safety reviews are performed prior to placing them into service. This review confirms that:\nConstruction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\nAdequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\nEmployee training has been completed\nFor a covered process, management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n8.

PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe site performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses to identify hazards and make recommendations to ensure safe operation. A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of processes. This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. The team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel.\n\n4.

Ammonia is used as a raw material at the Riverview. Ammonia as liquefied gas is stored in tanks. The ammonia is piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and Diammonium phosphate (DAP) plants. Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the pumps, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture. Ammonia is transported into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline and is stored in 2 storage vessels (bullets). Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in each bullet to 193 tons.  Additional ammonia is in the transfer pipe for ammonia to the MAP and DAP plants.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAt Mosaic, safety is the highest priority. Beginning in 1992, Mosaic incorporated this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) regulation. For Mosaic, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM regulation. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.\nThe site accident prevention program consists of the following:\n\n1.

Mosaic has established a process safety management system to ensure safe operation of the processes at the Riverview facility.\nThe risk management program (RMP) aids in the management of risks involved with the presence of hazardous substances at the Riverview. The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release. One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to include an executive summary in the RMP describing the program in place at Mosaic. This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nThe Riverview risk management program consists of three elements:\n1.
