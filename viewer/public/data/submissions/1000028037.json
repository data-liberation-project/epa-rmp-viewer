      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Land View, Inc. (LVI) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Minidoka, ID.  At this Facility, LVI engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use LVI's products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0 of the PSM/RMPr).  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Minidoka Facility located approximately 0.5 miles west-southwest of Minidoka at 925 N. Highway 24, Rupert, ID 83350.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Minidoka Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Minidoka Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nLVI recently completed a compliance audit of its Minidoka Facility.  As a result of this compliance audit, LVI determined that it operated five (5) covered processes instead of a one (1) covered process.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Minidoka Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates five covered processes that include (1) Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage; (2) Covered Process 2: 10-34-0 Reacting; (3) Covered Process 3: Storage and Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia); (4) Cover"

      "SummaryText": "ed Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Reacting; and (5) Covered Process 5: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia).  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via 34,000-gallon railcars (Covered Process 1) or a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck.  As related to Covered Process 2, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars and to a mobile pipe reactor to manufacture 10-34-0 Fertilizer.  As related to Covered Process 3, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars to two 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and from the storage tanks to nurse tanks or to the aqua ammonia reactor.  As related to Covered Process 4, anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the 18,000-gallon storage tanks or railcar to manufacture aqua ammonia and from the aqua reactor to two 32,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  As related to Covered Process 5, aqua ammonia is transferred from the aqua ammonia reactor or from commercial tanker trucks into the storage tanks, or from the storage tanks to commercial tanker trucks for transportation and delivery to the client.\r\n\r\nThe Minidoka Facility owns and operates Covered Processes 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with this PSM/RMPr.  As related to Covered Process 1, Minidoka does not own or operate the railcars but does conduct inspections in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  As related to Covered Process 2, Minidoka Contracts an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC) to manufacture the 10-34-0 Fertilizer.  Minidoka requires that the IFRC have in place and operates its mobile pipe reactor equipment in accordance with an OSHA PSM.    \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as"

Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that LVI uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the ruptured transfer line.\r\n\r\nLVI calculated the effected population within the modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for both the worst case and alternative case release scenarios for each covered process.  LVI used the Census Bureau LandView6 software package containing the 2000 Census tract Data to determine the effected population.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Magic Valley Manager implements the PSM/RMPr at this Facility.  The Magic Valley Manager is assisted by other LVI staff, as directed.  The Magic Valley Manager is responsible for ensuring that LVI Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nLVI's Minidoka Facility is a non-responding facility.
