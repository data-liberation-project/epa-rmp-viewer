The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Equipment associated with this covered process includes up to six (6) 34,000-gallon railcars that are stored on the northeast or central rail spurs at the Facility.  Trained Facility personnel conduct inspections of the railcars in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr while the railcars are staged on the Facility rail spur.\n\n\n\nAt the northeast rail spur, the Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC) transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the railcar and to its mobile pipe reactor to manufacture 10-34-0 Fertilizer.  The IFRC is responsible for the railcar and transfer of anhydrous ammonia when its equipment is connected to the railcar.  The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the mobile pipe reactor operations.\n\n\n\nAt the central rail spur, trained Facility personnel conduct the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the rail car and to the 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks or to the aqua ammonia reactor to manufacture aqua ammonia.  Minidoka is responsible for conducting the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars in accordance with this PSM/RMPr.\n\n",

The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Equipment associated with this covered process includes two 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks, ancillary pumps, piping, and valves.  From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia is either transferred to the aqua-ammonia manufacturing process, or to nurse tanks.  (Transfers to nurse tanks are not currently performed due to a lack of operable nurse tanks at the facility, but they could be performed in the future.)  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility by 34,000-gallon railcars or a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck.  If by railcar, trained Minidoka personnel transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the railcar to the stationary storage tanks.  Minidoka personnel are also trained to transfer the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tanks to the aqua ammonia reactor or to the nurse tanks. Minidoka is responsible for training its personnel and managing the anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nIf Minidoka receives anhydrous ammonia by a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck (Vendor), the vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia will transfer the anhydrous ammonia from its tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The vendor is responsible to Minidoka for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Minidoka and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Minidoka will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its PSM/RMPr Document upon request.\n\n",

The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Equipment associated with this covered process includes two 32,000-gallon stationary storage tanks, ancillary pumps, piping, and valves.  The aqua ammonia is transferred from the aqua ammonia reactor to the storage tanks.  From the stationary storage tanks, the aqua ammonia is transferred to a commercial tanker truck for transportation of the aqua ammonia to the client.  Trained Facility personnel conduct the transfer of the aqua ammonia in accordance with the PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nOn occasion, Minidoka receives aqua ammonia from a commercial tanker truck (Vendor).  The vendor that transports the aqua ammonia will transfer the aqua ammonia from its tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The vendor is responsible to Minidoka for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Minidoka and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Minidoka will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its PSM/RMPr Document upon request.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Land View, Inc. (LVI) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act ? 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR ? 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR ?68.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations in Minidoka, ID.  At this Facility, LVI engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use LVI's products to support agricultural operations (See Section 3.0 of the PSM/RMPr).  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Minidoka Facility located approximately 0.5 miles west-southwest of Minidoka at 925 N. Highway 24, Rupert, ID 83350.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Minidoka Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Minidoka Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nLVI recently completed a compliance audit of its Minidoka Facility.  As a result of this compliance audit, LVI determined that it operated five (5) covered processes instead of a one (1) covered process.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Minidoka Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates five covered processes that include (1) Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage; (2) Covered Process 2: 10-34-0 Reacting; (3) Covered Process 3: Storage and Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia); (4) Cover"

      "SummaryText": "ed Process 4: Aqua Ammonia Reacting; and (5) Covered Process 5: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia).  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via 34,000-gallon railcars (Covered Process 1) or a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck.  As related to Covered Process 2, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars and to a mobile pipe reactor to manufacture 10-34-0 Fertilizer.  As related to Covered Process 3, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars to two 18,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and from the storage tanks to nurse tanks or to the aqua ammonia reactor.  As related to Covered Process 4, anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the 18,000-gallon storage tanks or railcar to manufacture aqua ammonia and from the aqua reactor to two 32,000-gallon stationary storage tanks.  As related to Covered Process 5, aqua ammonia is transferred from the aqua ammonia reactor or from commercial tanker trucks into the storage tanks, or from the storage tanks to commercial tanker trucks for transportation and delivery to the client.\n\n\n\nThe Minidoka Facility owns and operates Covered Processes 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with this PSM/RMPr.  As related to Covered Process 1, Minidoka does not own or operate the railcars but does conduct inspections in accordance with the PSM/RMPr Operating Procedures.  As related to Covered Process 2, Minidoka Contracts an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC) to manufacture the 10-34-0 Fertilizer.  Minidoka requires that the IFRC have in place and operates its mobile pipe reactor equipment in accordance with an OSHA PSM.    \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for both covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as"

Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that LVI uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the ruptured transfer line.\n\n\n\nLVI calculated the effected population within the modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for both the worst case and alternative case release scenarios for each covered process.  LVI used the Census Bureau LandView6 software package containing the 2000 Census tract Data to determine the effected population.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Magic Valley Manager implements the PSM/RMPr at this Facility.  The Magic Valley Manager is assisted by other LVI staff, as directed.
