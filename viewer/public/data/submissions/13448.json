This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Fair Oaks Farms Maintenance Supervisor (if he is present).  He will then use a portable radio to inform the other managers and contractors of the situation. The Fair Oaks Farms Maintenance Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as neccessary as outlined in the Emergency Repsonse Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the Fair Oaks Farms facility located at 7600 95th St. in Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158.  The recommendations will be implemented by June 1, 2000.\n\nR01:  Replace relief valves every five years.\n\nR02:  Install an ammonia release detection system, with remote alarms (Security Office and ADS). Release detection should also tie in to automatic ventilation system, per IIAR Bulletin #111.\n\nR03:  Alarm system should be upgraded to provide visual and audible alarm and a remote signal.\n\nR04:  Preventative Maintenance shall include replacing critical solenoid valves every five years.\n\nR05:  Consider installation of ammonia sensors in each room with an evaporator.  Sensors should have audible and visual alarms, as well as remote signals at Engine Room Office, Maintenance Shop, Security Office, and/or ADS.  Sensors should also be tied in with the solenoid valves so they"

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.  To save lives.\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.  To protect the environment.\n4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nFair Oaks Farms maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to\nrespond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Fair Oaks Farms ammonia refrigeration system has been in operation since 1992. The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 7600 95th St. in Pleasant Prairie, WI 53158.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 12,500 pounds of ammonia for the processing and cold storage of meat products..  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers and high pressure receiver are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold process/storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nSTEPS\n\nThe Fair Oaks Farms facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ammonia refrigeration industry safety and design standards (Uniform Mechanical Code).

The engine room is provided with continuous ventilation and all equipment are monitored for temperature and pressure 24 hours a day.  The facility is secured and guarded at all times.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver - 12,500 pounds - in 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 7600 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability.  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has been in operation since 1992 and changes/modifications have taken place since the completion.  There is no accident history at this facility from June 1994 through June 1999.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFair Oaks Farms maintains a safety committee whose members are th"
