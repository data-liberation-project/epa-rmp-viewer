Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Illini FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Chrisman Fire Department, Edgar County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.

The storage and handling system consists of 2 - 18,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 486,000 pounds, this includes the amount of andydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.
