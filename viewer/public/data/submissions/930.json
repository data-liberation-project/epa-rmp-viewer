      "SummaryText": "Mid-Florida Freezer Warehouses, Ltd. has a active training program for Hazmat employees that covers general awareness, familiarization training,function specific training, safety training and driver training. The refrigeration dept. is operated and maintained by employees who must undergo rigorous supervised on the job training. We maintain a twenty four hour watch with employees who are trained for emergency response and containment if there should be a chemical release.   Emergency response policy-  1. if possible our employees will attempt to secure the source of the spill without exposing themselves or others to the chemical. 2. If the chemical is flammable or a potential health hazard, we will evacuate the area as soon as possible. 3. Employees will seal off the area with safety cones or barricade tape. 4. Supervision will check the product Material Safety Data Sheet and the DOT Emergency Response Guidebook for containment and cleanup information. 5. Contain the spill to prevent itfrom spreading. 6. When containing the spill we will use drain covers, mats and absorbent socks to cover or seal off any nearby drains. 7. All leaking containers will be stored in salvage ( overpack )  drums. 8. If emergency evacuation is required we will use  our facility's list of emergency phone numbers to call the local spill response team and fire department."
