Facility Policy.\n         The owners, management and employees of Greenbelt Elevator Company, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire departments, Hardin County LEPC and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n          A primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 310,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n           a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a period of ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm) is 1.10 miles.\n           b.     The alternate release scenario, the most likely potential incident, would be the release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose, followed by the release of ammonia for two minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or remote shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 mile.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n          Greenbelt Elevator Company, Inc. is in compliance with the provisionsof \"Safety Req"

(ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n          There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years the have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or emvironmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan\n          Greenbelt Elevator has:\n          a.     A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n          b.     Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n          Safety improvement is an ongoing process at Greenbelt Elevator. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of our facility. There are no additional specific recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammoinia for implementation at this time."
