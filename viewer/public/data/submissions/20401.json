This commitment is demonstrated in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We also coordinate with Union County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 11 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, ethylene [ethene], vinyl chloride, hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid], oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], propylene oxide [oxirane, methyl-], sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), and sulfur trioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Vinyl chloride is used for chemical synthesis. Ethylene  [Ethene] is used for chemical synthesis.  Hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid [hydrofluoric acid] is used for chemical synthesis. Oleum (fuming sulfuric acid) [sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for chemical synthesis.
