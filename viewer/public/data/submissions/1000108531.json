The plan is an active part of the operation of the WRF and as such it is updated on a regular basis and not less than once per year.  All effort are made to ensure that the Plan meets compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Padre Dam MWD has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the WRF.  The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the Team's response are continuously being reviewed. Padre Dam MWD has implemented all recommendations from the initial technical studies, as well as all recommendations from the previous PSM/RMP/CalARP Compliance Audit (August 31, 2020) and the previous Process Hazard Analysis (March 5, 2019). \n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the District employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.   Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

This Plan has been developed and designed with the following in consideration:\n\n1.  To protect the lives of the Ray Stoyer WRF staff, support activities related to release prevention and mitigation, and to protect ANY public receptors within the toxic endpoints of an accidental release.\n\n2.  For the purpose of mitigating all potential releases from the Ray Stoyer WRF and to prevent injuries.\n\n3.  To minimize damage to property and to the surrounding environment.\n\nPadre Dam MWD has taken on an aggressive hazardous materials emergency response training program to prevent any potential releases from the Ray Stoyer WRF. Site personnel and backup site personnel are First Responders - Technician Level and trained to respond to a chemical release.  The Ray Stoyer WRF is equipped with a 16' Hazmat Emergency Response Trailer which contains the tools and communication equipment necessary for an effective response to a chemical release, including, but not limited to Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, Level A suits, rubber boots, radios, etc. First Responder training includes an annual drill of a postulated hazardous material release coordinated with the Santee Fire Department, the City of San Diego Hazmat Unit and the County of San Diego Hazmat Unit.  \n\nAll personnel actively participate with the safety training and planning for the facility.  The Ray Stoyer WRF's Hazardous Materials Business Plan as well as the safety plan provides the personne"

In the Chlorine Feed Room, the response at 1 ppm is identical to the Chlorine Storage Room, but with the Chlorine Feed Room leak on the control computer. In the Sulfur Dioxide Storage rooms, the response is for 2 ppm with all activations as Chlorine at 1 ppm, but for Sulfur Dioxide.  At 4 ppm, the response is similar activation as Chlorine at 2 ppm except there is no scrubber, but instead sprinkler valves open.  In the Sulfur Dioxide Feed Room, activation is at 2 ppm only, and all responses are the same as the Storage Room, but with both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide sensors reporting Feed Room leaks on the control computer.\n\nThe entire chemical feed system at the facility is tied into a Factory Link - NT computer system(s) that monitors and operates the facility.  In the event of an accidental release, detected by either activation of a scrubber or a sensor within the storage buildings, Ray Stoyer WRF personnel are notified by auto-dial pager systems. The system operates 24 hours per day and operators ensure the system is on a daily basis. The auto-dialer system also notifies other plant operators to respond as backups or first entry individuals to mitigate the leak.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility\u2019s accident history conducted at the time of the PHA Revalidation (October 9, 2023), there have been n"

Practices and procedures for proper chlorine handling were obtained from the Chlorine Institute Manual for the Safe Handling of Chlorine. Because sulfur dioxide gas is nearly identical in physical properties to chlorine and is stored and fed in identical cylinders as chlorine, same safety practices are used for sulfur dioxide.  In addition to plant safety program for the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, there is a gas detector in the chlorine storage room and the feed room.  In the Chlorine Storage Room, at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm the detection system will activate a visual/ audible alarm, shut down HVAC, show a CL2 Storage Room leak on control computer and activate an autodialer.  At 2 ppm, the detection system will activate a visual/ audible alarm, shut down HVAC, show a CL2"

The Safety & Risk Manager administers the District's safety and environmental policies. The Safety & Risk Manager is responsible for various inspections of the District's facilities to ensure compliance and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nLocation of Padre Dam MWD Ray Stoyer Water Recycling Facility (Ray Stoyer WRF) is 12001 North Fanita Parkway, in Santee, California 92071, and began operations in 1967.   \n\nThe Ray Stoyer WRF used chlorine injection until 1975, when it was discontinued due to a change in operations. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide were re-introduced to the facility in 1996/97 as a result of an upgrade and expansion of the Ray Stoyer WRF to a 2 million gallons per day (MGD) facility.  The Ray Stoyer WRF treats wastewater as per the requirements of Title 22 reclaimed water standards for distribution into a reclaimed water system within the Santee region.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe chlorine feed system consists of one ton containers which are the storage vessels for chlorine.
