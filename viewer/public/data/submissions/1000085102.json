In all cases where an ambulance is notified of an emergency, the Fire Department will be notified via the ambulance service. \n\n6.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the What If PHA completed for anhydrous ammonia, a list of action items was developed and is being monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished. Kraft Heinz Columbia continues to work with the local Columbia Fire Department by scheduling occasional group meetings with the Fire Department and plant personnel, working through tabletop ammonia release scenarios, and sharing information on plant procedures, expectations, and partnership in responding to ammonia emergencies at the plant."

The facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders for ammonia releases. This facility has implemented the Kraft Heinz electronic preventive maintenance system. This system uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  \nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Columbia Fire Department in the event of an emergency. \n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location, Kraft Heinz processes meat products. The SIC code for the primary process at this facility is 2013. This facility is capable of producing and packaging various meat products including hot dogs, beef franks, and turkey franks for consumer intake. The plant is not equipped to slaughter; boxed trimmings are shipped to the plant. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve meat products. Some of these areas include receiving, raw material cooler, pre-blend, preparation/stuffing, stripping, packaging, palletizing, finished product coolers, and other storage areas. The plant produces fully cooked hot dogs in processing ovens on-site using only condensed natural smoke (CNS).\n\nKraft Heinz has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, anhydrous ammonia, at this location.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plant's refrigeration process.  \nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 73,520 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to anhydrous ammonia at the Kraft Heinz plant located in Columbia, MO.\n\n3.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Prev"

      "SummaryText": "ention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program. Based on the new Safer Communities by Chemical Accident Prevention (SCCAP) rule, Kraft Heinz Columbia plant strives to stay in compliance with OSHA EAP/OSHA PSM/EPA RMP requirements.\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\nA.      The main piping system for the anhydrous ammonia process is located on the roof of the plant. This serves as an excellent safeguard for plant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of anhydrous ammonia piping inside occupied rooms. Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and machinery, there's less of a chance of an anhydrous ammonia release. \n\nB.\tMost anhydrous ammonia containing equipment such as accumulators, receivers, etc. are located outside of the facility in the Ammonia Tank Farm.\n\nC.\tThe majority of the critical ammonia isolation valves are located outside of the plant and on the roof, making them more accessible if a release were to occur.\n\nD.\tThe plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures. \n\nE.\tThe plant periodically shuts down parts of the anhydrous ammonia system and conducts inspections. \n\n4.0\tFive-year Accident History\n\nKraft Heinz Columbia plant has not had an accident in the past 5 years that meets the EPA RMP reporting criteria.\n\n5.0\tEmergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams. The Emergency Response Plan contains a list of employees who should be contacted in the event of an emergency. There are also back-up personnel if the primary incident response personnel cannot be contacted. The emergency response plan includes information about the frequency of employee em"
