When implemented, a PSM/RMP Program makes operations safe and accident prevention systematic throughout a facility. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the program requirements. These fourteen elements consist of the following:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Planning and Response, and Trade Secrets. To ensure emergency preparedness, Reddy Ice-Plant City has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for proper authority notifications and safe evacuation of facility personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nAs a company, Reddy Ice is committed to operating safe and compliant facilities for the protection of their employees, the public, and the environment. The Plant City facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system. These safeguards include mechanical ventilation systems, operating limit controls, and remote system shutdown capability if required. In addition, refrigerant leak detection units are installed throughout the facility to monitor atmospheric concentrations continuously and to notify employees in the event of a fugitive release. \n\n",

Incidents involving ammonia can be reduced through properly implementing employee training, establishing a knowledge base of the equipment, and developing effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment.
