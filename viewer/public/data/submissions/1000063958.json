Frontage Rd., Plant City, FL, operates a closed-circuit mechanical refrigerating system that utilizes anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) as a refrigerant in the manufacture and storage of packaged ice for wholesale and retail distribution.

Due to a moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazard chemical.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nAs a company, Reddy Ice is committed to operating safe and regulatory compliant facilities for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. Incidents involving ammonia can be reduced through properly implementing employee training, establishing a knowledge base of the equipment, and developing effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment. To reduce the risk of ammonia incidents, Reddy Ice-Plant City has developed a combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RMP) Program to meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency regulations defined in 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nWhen implemented, a PSM/RMP Program makes operations safe and accident prevention systematic throughout a facility. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the program requirements. These fourteen elements consist of the following:  Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Qualifications, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Planning and Response, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA site-specific management system has been developed to oversee the implementation "
