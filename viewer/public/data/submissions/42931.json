We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank, forty-four 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and three 1,500-\ngallon nurse tanks at our facility in St. Charles, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored\nis 66,500 gallons (290,877.7 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest\nsingle storage vessel at our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage\ncapacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTwin Valley Ag Service maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the c"
