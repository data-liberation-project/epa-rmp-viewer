Santa Fe Springs Warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide and/or Hydrochloric acid from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the above mentioned materials. Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide, Ammonia (anhydrous),  Hydrochloric acid or Formaldehyde to employees (vapor-dispersion modeling demonstrates no impact public receptors). Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. \r\n\r\nThe Santa Fe Springs Warehouse Emergency Response Program consists of:\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Action Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\r\n\u00bf\tChemical Exposure and Chemical Spill Cleanup Procedure\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Evacuation Plan \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise.

This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Team Member Handbook, and the mission statement, which are available to all employees. The Safety and Health policy states:\r\n\r\nSAFETY FIRST is more than a slogan at Rinchem...it is a way of life.

The facility provides transportation and public warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end users of pre-packaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements.

After the material passes inspection, it is loaded on to a truck for shipment using a forklift.  \r\n\r\n1.3.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequate communication of potential hazards at the Rinchem Santa Fe Springs, CA Warehouse.  Rinchem conducted an offsite consequence analysis, using the EPA's Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) , RMPcomp in conjunction with the rules specified in 40 CFR 68.25 to estimate the offsite consequence of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) from our warehousing process. The WCS associated with toxic substances in the Santa Fe Springs, CA warehouse is a catastrophic failure of the single largest container resulting in a release of the total contents, 55 gallons of Ammonium Hydroxide, Hydrochloric acid or Formaldehyde (each shown separately). The passive mitigation measures taken into account for this scenario are the limited quantity of any of the three chemicals that can be released due to container and the handling of containers within the building. \r\n\r\n1.4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in Planned Changes to Improve Safety. The safeguards shown in Table A-1 include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of chlorine.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n1.5.\tThe Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving Ammonium Hydroxide, ( Ammonia anhydrous), Hydrochloric acid, Formaldehyde or any other chemical  at the Ri"
