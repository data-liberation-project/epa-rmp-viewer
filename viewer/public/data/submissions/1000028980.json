As a result, we are a member of the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee and actively participate in events sponsored by the Lucas County LEPC. This participation includes attendance at meetings held by the Lucas County LEPC,and participation in Lucas County LEPC 2012 Black Swamp full scale security exercise. This participation also includes attendance at special events. Chemtrade Refinery Solutions was a proud participant in the community safety awareness events held at the Franklin Park Mall and at the Oregon Fest.\r\n\r\nConsistent with Chemtrade Refinery Solutions commitment to safety and the protection of the environment, Chemtrade Refinery Solutions is also an active member of Responsible Care. This commitment ensures that process operations do not present an unacceptable level of risk to employees, customers, the public or the environment. It ensures that information regarding the hazards of our products is provided to our customers, emergency response personnel and the public. It also ensures an understanding of product hazards, compliance with all legal requirements, sensitivity to community concerns and active assistance with governments and selected organizations to foster and encourage equitable and attainable standards.\r\n\r\nUnforeseeably, if an accidental release occurs, despite the rigorous controls maintained by Chemtrade Refinery Solutions, our emergency action plan is fully integrated with that of the Oregon Fire Department. This means that highly trained personnel are continuously ready to control and mitigate all effects of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nChemtrade refinery Solutions also maintain numerous accident prevention controls that are fully described below.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance"

      "SummaryText": "Chemtrade Refinery Solutions provides sulfuric acid recycling services. We process used or \"spent\" sulfuric acid into fresh acid that can then be reused. Oleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is the regulated substance that is present in the oleum process at our facility. Oleum is a mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide. The maximum expected inventory of oleum based upon our operational requirements is 1,200,000 pounds. It is used to create products used by most Americans on a regular basis. Oleum is a constituent of laundry detergent and is also used to produce \"white oil\" and computer chips.\r\nChemtrade Refinery Solutions provides recycling of chemical spent sulfuric acid services. Methyl Ether is the regulated substance that is present in the chemical spent regeneration process from unloading rail cars and truck trailers into separate tanks to the pumping of chemical spent to the decomposition furnace where it is incinerated. The maximum expected inventory of Methyl Ether is 234,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used look up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details regarding the scenarios chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario associated with the toxic substance oleum involves a catastrophic release of 20% oleum due to a storage tank failure. In this scenario, 1,200,000 pounds of 20% oleum are immediately released into the environment. The ground is sloped so that the oleum will flow from around the tank to a sump resulting in an exposed surface area of a maximum of 1000 square feet.  EPA lookup tables predict that the fumes will travel 3.70 miles before the fume concentration in the air will reach a safe level at 0.01 mg/L.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario associated with the flammible substance Methyl Ether involves a catastrophic release of 123,000 lbs of 100% released over a te"

EPA lookup tables predict an endpoint safe level of 0.30 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario associated with the toxic substance oleum involves a release of 3,200 pounds of 20% oleum from a loading hose over a ten (10) minute period. EPA Lookup tables predict that the fumes will travel 0.20 miles before the fume concentration in the air will reach a safe level at 0.01 mg/L. This release is controlled by both active and passive mitigation measures, including neutralization.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the State of Ohio, Chemtrade Refinery Solutions added a second alternative release scenario involving a small hole in the Oleum Storage tank.  This release is similar impact as the hose failure above.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario associated with the flammible substance Methyl Ether involves a release of 3,200 pounds of chemical spent from a unloading hose over a ten minute period. EPA Lookup tables predict an endpoint safe level of 0.01 miles.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Prevention Program Steps\r\n\r\nChemtrade Refinery Solutions is committed to reducing the risk of accidental release of hazardous substances at our Oregon facility. First, this facility has been constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. Second, because the Oleum process is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Plan, we also take all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements for Program 3 processes that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the accident prevention programs in place at the oleum process at our facility.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nChemtrade Refinery Solutions maintains detailed records of process safety information to ensure the safe operation of its facility. In general, Process Safety Information pertains to process chemicals, technology and equipment. Process Safety Information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipm"

Our qualified team uses the Hazard and Operability Study methodology, also known as the Hazop, to perform its Process Hazards Analysis. This team thoroughly uses its expertise in engineering and process operations to identify process hazards. It makes all recommendations necessary to control the identified hazards. Management is responsible for addressing these recommendations in a timely manner. The Process Hazards Analyses are also made available to all affected employees in the Process Safety Information binders. To ensure that all changes to a process are accounted for, the Process Hazard Analysis is revalidated every five (5) years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nTo ensure the safe conduct of activities within the oleum and chemical spent acid processes, Chemtrade Refinery Solutions maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address all stages of operation, from initial startup through emergency shutdown. Operating procedures are readily accessible to all operators involved in the processes within the Process Safety Information binders located in the control rooms and in the lunchroom. They are also used as a reference tool to train new employees.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo ensure that all employees involved in the operation of the oleum and chemical spent acid process are competent to operate and maintain that process, Chemtrade Refinery Solutions maintains a comprehensive training program.
