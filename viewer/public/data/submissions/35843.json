Surrounding land uses include open agricultural (south and east of the property), commercial or light industrial (west, south, and north), and residential (to the north on the opposite side of Highway 50).  The primary business of Aerojet at its Sacramento site is the manufacture and testing of rocket propulsion systems. The substances regulated by the RMP at the site are fuels consumed during rocket engine testing.  These are hydrazine, methylhydrazine and dimethylhydrazine.  The maximum anticipated inventories, based on current business needs, are 25000 pounds, 30000 pounds and 25000 pounds, respectively.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMuch of Aerojet\u00bfs business is performed under contract to the Department of Defense (DoD).  The safety provisions in these contracts touch every aspect of the work performed, from tool design to the location of buildings relative to the property boundaries and each other.  These requirements compliment those of the Federal RMP regulation.\n\nThe majority of the Sacramento facility is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations promulgated by the state of California, which are nearly identical to the Federal RMP regulation when it comes to prevention disciplines.  These disciplines include:\n\n- Evaluation of new chemicals and process modifications to identify their potential impacts,\n- Critical reviews (design, experiment, test readiness) of new processes/operations by teams of knowledgeable employees,\n- Extensive use of checklist procedures, which are step-by-step instructions, to accomplish tasks,\n- Development of training matrices for each position, and tracking of training completion,\n- Aggressive investigation of incidents to identify causes and apply prevention efforts to subsequent activities,\n- Installation of alarm, detection, and automatic sh"

The few incidents at processes covered by the RMP regulation were minor, and lessons learned from them have been applied to future operations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOverall safety at the Aerojet Sacramento site is a function not only of programs to prevent accidental releases from occurring, but also of programs to mitigate the effects of accidental releases should they occur. The Aerojet Sacramento site has an emergency response program that is designed to protect lives, the environment, and property in the area.  Key features of this program include:  \n\n- An industrial fire brigade present on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,\n- An on-call HAZMAT response team composed of Aerojet personnel,\n- Alarms that terminate in a central station monitored at all times by security personnel,\n- An emergency operation center with real-time dispersion modeling capability,\n- Membership in the regional LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Commission),\n- Periodic tours by community responders, and\n- Periodic drills and exercises.\n\nDecades of experience have demonstrated that these features, combined with the prevention activities previously mentioned, assure that chemical releases, if they occur, will be limited in scope and duration.\n\nAdditional Comments\n\nThe foundation of an effective prevention program is realistic assessment of process and chemical risks. Our RMP includes both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The alternative release scenarios were identified through careful review of operational safeguards, hazard analyses, and more than 45 years of experience.  They"

      "SummaryText": "represent credible events that can be thought of as \u00bflargest-likely\u00bf scenarios.  Coupled with realistic weather conditions, dispersion modeling indicates that there would be no off-site impacts from these scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios require unrealistic assumptions about release quantities, release mechanisms, response actions and meteorological conditions.  Aerojet therefore maintains that these worst-case scenarios do not permit accurate risk determinations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLiquid engine testing at the Sacramento site has declined in recent years and that trend is expected to continue.  The anticipated result is a further reduction in the inventories of the three materials mentioned above.  These reductions may also be enhanced by consolidation of engine testing activities into fewer locations."

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nAerojet management has been committed to safety as a number one priority since operations began in Sacramento County in the early 1950s. Strict operating controls and safety standards have been in place from the very beginning, including a system for reporting, investigating, and preventing accidents. Aerojet maintains a staff of Security, Safety, Industrial Hygiene, and Fire Service and Environmental personnel to oversee the various programs that implement this commitment.\n\nToday, the experience gained from almost 50 years of rocket manufacturing and testing has resulted in one of the most impressive safety records in the aerospace industry; incidents involving regulated substances have been rare and minor in nature. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Aerojet commitment to safety begins with acceptance of its stewardship role over the chemicals used.  Recognition of the potential hazards associated with hazardous materials use and handling has led to the understanding that facilities that are properly designed, constructed, operated, inspected, and maintained are of paramount importance in preventing accidental releases.  Consequently, extensive programs have been developed to evaluate risks and either eliminate them or control them to acceptable levels through the use of engineering and/or administrative controls.\n\nAerojet also recognizes that unplanned events are possible.  Considerable resources are devoted to emergency response planning, maintenance of emergency response equipment and supplies, and employee training.  The company has also developed a close working relationship with community responders.   \n\nFacility Description and the Regulated Substances Used\n\nThe Aerojet Sacramento site is located approximately 15 miles east of downtown Sacramento at Highway 50 and Hazel Avenue. The property covers about 8,500 contiguous acres. It extends between Sunrise Boulevard in Rancho Cordova on the west and Prairie City"
