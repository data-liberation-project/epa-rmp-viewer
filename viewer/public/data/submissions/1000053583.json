The Water Treatment Facility has assembled and maintains appropriate materials in the form of manufacturers literature, handbooks, pictures, drawings, etc. to demonstrate clearly the layout of the facility's potential trouble areas and the equipment which the Sulphur Springs Fire Department may need to work with to alleviate an emergency situation.

The plan concentrates on chemical release emergencies and specifies emergency response procedures to be followed by City of Sulphur Springs employees. These activities include recognition of the emergency; responding in a defensive manner in the protection of life and property; limited control, containment, and confinement activities; and facility evacuation. OSHA HAZWOPER requirements for achieving this capability are detailed. The plan is constructed generally around the requirements given in 29 CFR 1910.120. It is intended primarily for use in connection with a chlorine release, since that is the facility's most sensitive chemical from both safety and environmental points of view. This plan is intended for use in conjunction with the Facilities Emergency Action Plan covering evacuation procedures. The Emergency Response Plan is backed up by and is a supplement to Annex Q of the City of Sulphur Spring Emergency Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe facility manager is directly responsible for coordinating the efforts involving this Emergency Response Plan. The facility manager is closely involved with the activities which bear on the facility's interface with the public, Fire and Emergency Management responders as well.
