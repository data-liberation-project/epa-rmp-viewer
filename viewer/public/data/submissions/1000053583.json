The plan concentrates on chemical release emergencies and specifies emergency response procedures to be followed by City of Sulphur Springs employees. These activities include recognition of the emergency; responding in a defensive manner in the protection of life and property; limited control, containment, and confinement activities; and facility evacuation. OSHA HAZWOPER requirements for achieving this capability are detailed. The plan is constructed generally around the requirements given in 29 CFR 1910.120. It is intended primarily for use in connection with a chlorine release, since that is the facility's most sensitive chemical from both safety and environmental points of view. This plan is intended for use in conjunction with the Facilities Emergency Action Plan covering evacuation procedures. The Emergency Response Plan is backed up by and is a supplement to Annex Q of the City of Sulphur Spring Emergency Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility manager is directly responsible for coordinating the efforts involving this Emergency Response Plan. The facility manager is closely involved with the activities which bear on the facility's interface with the public, Fire and Emergency Management responders as well. The City Manager has overall accountability for the program. The facility manager and shift supervisors are responsible for directing the activities of the employees involved in emergency responses.\n\n\n\nIt is not the intent of the Water Treatment Facility to maintain a complete hazardous material emergency response team. Activities of facility employees are limite"

The intent of the facility is to maintain a training level no higher than Hazardous Materials Operational Level. This level of training permits the employee to respond at the site of emergency only under conditions permitting activities within their levels of expertise gained through the training described below. In the event of the use of the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and Office of Emergency Management, employee assistance in the emergency response will be under the guidance of the on-site incident Commander, which in our case means only along with outside responding entry teams, and only if the assistance can be given within parameters set for the training level achieved by facility employees.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains coordination with the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize them with the potential emergencies that might occur. The Water Treatment Facility has assembled and maintains appropriate materials in the form of manufacturers literature, handbooks, pictures, drawings, etc. to demonstrate clearly the layout of the facility's potential trouble areas and the equipment which the Sulphur Springs Fire Department may need to work with to alleviate an emergency situation. This material will be used by facility personnel, in a safe area prior to entry into the emergency site, to assist the Sulphur Springs Fire Department in their activities, and to show the outside responders what they need to do to mitigate any potential emergency situation.\n\n\n\nPeriodic tours are offered to the Sulphur Springs Fire Department and the Sulphur Springs Office of Emergency Management in order to familiarize their personnel with our facility. \n\n\n\nIn any emergency situation, the facility manager will be in overall charge of the facility employees and their activities.

The primary regulated product is chlorine.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Emergency Response Plan, on-site evacuation and facilitators or other management personnel will make the decision as to whether outside help needs to be summoned. This decision will be made on the basis of the type and scale of the emergency and the likelihood of injury to facility personnel, immediate neighbors, nearby residents of the community, and the environment. Fire Department, Office of Emergency Management, Emergency Medical Services and Police can be reached by calling 911\n\n\n\nIf outside emergency responders are summoned, the facility employees will give information including the location, the type of emergency, its scale including injuries, its location within the facility, and the best approach route.\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe City of Sulphur Springs Water Treatment Facility has had no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nFirst Responder Operational Level trained employees will respond to the emergency only in a defensive manner to protect nearby persons, property, and the environment. This training is designed to provide the ability to contain the release from a safe distance, keep it from spreading, and prevent exposures.\n\n\n\nThe First Responder Operational Level of training is available through the local Office of Emergency Management.
