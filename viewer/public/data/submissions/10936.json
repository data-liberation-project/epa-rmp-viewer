Further more we are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release of LP or Ammonia should occur it is our policy to notify the Wellington Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.     2.  Facility information: This facility is a grain handling facility, we also resale fertilizer, for farm use, and we resale LP-Gas as a heating source for our customers.  We have three 12000 gallon LP tanks and associated piping, valves, and other misc. equipment and we have a maximum storage of 216300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.       3.  The worst case scenario:  LP-Gas:  A release of 44000 pounds resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There are ten private homes within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 25 people.  Anhydrous Ammonia:  A release of the contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  According to the Degadis System the maximum quantity released would be 113815 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is 2.32 miles.        4.  Accidental release prevention program:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all state and local codes and regulations and our propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  Our facility is regulated by the Kansas Department of Ag.            5.  Five year accident history:  There has been no accidents within the last five years involving LP-Gas or Anhydrous that caused death or injury to people or property or environmental damage.          6.  The emergency response program:  This facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 191"
