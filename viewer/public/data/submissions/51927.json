      "SummaryText": "Georgia Gulf Chemicals, LLC Aberdeen PVC plant has a long history of safe operation in the Aberdeen community.  Our employees work hard every hour, every day to provide a safe workplace for themselves while protecting the environment inside and outside our fences.      \n\nPLANT INFORMATION\nThe Aberdeen plant produces polyvinyl chlorine (PVC or vinyl) resins and compounds.  These materials are used in downstream operations to produce wire and cable insulation, vinyl siding, pipe, packaging, and numerous other similar products .  The resins and compounds are produced by the polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  After the polymerization, the resin is dried and stored for shipping.  Most of the VCM used in the process is shipped by rail from Georgia Gulf's Louisiana operations.  The VCM is a gas at normal conditions, but is kept under pressure and handled as a liquid, in a similar manner to propane.  At certain concentrations the VCM is flammable, therefore the plant has many safety systems in place.  Both the Flammable Chemical Vinyl Chlorine Monomer and the Toxic Chemical Chlorine, which isused as a water treatment additive, have been addressed in the RMP Plan preparation.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\nIn calculating the worst-case scenario for flammable chemicals, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requires the following assumptions be made:\nCatastrophic (complete) failure of the largest storage vessel\nComplete loss of the contents of the vessel and vaporization of the liquid in ten minutes\nMixing of sufficient air with the vapors to generate an explosion with a 10 percent yield-the worst seen for mixture of flammable vapors with air\nNone of the plant's procedures or emergency systems work\nIgnition of the vapor cloud as soon as all the material vaporizes\n\nThe impact of these worst-case events decreases as you move away from the facility.  It is important to understand the standard measure of impact for determining the impacted zones.  These limits are d"

For flammable releases, the company is required to define the impacted areas within which one would see a shock wave of 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure, or in other words a wave significant enough to cause damage such as shattering of windows and partial demolition of houses.\n\nThe likelihood of a worst-case scenario is extremely remote and is of limited value for planning purposes.  This scenario defines the largest possible impacted zone.\n\nVCM is unloaded from railcars and is stored in a spherical tank.  The capacity of this vessel is 6 million pounds of VCM.  If the vessel was completely full, ruptured, none of the safety systems functioned properly, it was a hot day and all the liquid vaporized in ten minutes, the atmospheric conditions provided sufficient oxygen without dispersing the vapor cloud, a spark set off an explosion, and the maximum explosive yield was generated, the off-site area impacted would consist of circle, centered in the processing unit, with a radius of 1.1 miles.\n\nIn calculating the worst-case scenario for toxic gases, the EPA requires the assumption that the total quantity in the single largest vessel or process line (passive mitigation measures may be taken into account) is released as a gas over a period of ten minutes.  In the worst-case scenario for the toxic chemical chlorine, a scenario in which the entire content of a back-up system comprised of two one-ton cylinders was released.  Assuming the length of the release is 10 minutes, the off-site area impacted would consist of a circle, centered at the utlities area, with a radius of 1.9 miles.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\nOther release scenarios are also required to be considered.  The alternate-case scenarios generally involve smaller releases and take into account the mitigating ability of safety systems in determining the extent of impact.

Many changes, both operational and procedural, have been made since, in an attempt to decrease the likelihood of events such as this occuring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\nGeorgia  Gulf strives to be able to respond to any situation.  To accomplish this goal, our emergency preparedness efforts focus on four areas:\n\nPersonnel - The most important part of any response plan is well trainined, qualified people such as Georgia Gulf's voluntary Emergency Response Team (ERT).  The team consists of employees from various departments within the plant.  They train annually at places such as Texas A&M's school for firefighters and the Mississippi State Fire Academy.  On-site training is conducted regularly to test and refine the skills acquired at those facilities.  The ERT members have specialized training in fire fighting, hazardous materials handling, confined-space rescue and medical training.\n\nResources - The proper equipment is a necessary requirement for any job.  In the field of emergency response, it is necessary that equipment, materials, and labor be available immediately as needed.  The Aberdeen facility is equipped with such items as chemical transportation response equipment, automatically activated fire water systems, portable fire water monitors, fire fighting gear, fire extinguishers and other necessary equipment.\n\nAlthough it is hoped they will never be necessary, Georgia Gulf Chemicals & Vinyls, LLC has provi"

The community may use them in case of severe weather, chemical accidents, or any situation requiring action.\n\nPlanning - Complete plans are a must to help guide people and resources in the event of an emergency.  Georgia Gulf Chemcials and Vinyls, LLC has plans in place to handle on-site and off-site incidents.  Our plans have been developed in coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nAlliances - To provide for additional resources in the event of a major incident, the Aberdeen plant has agreements with the Aberdeen Fire Department and local emergency medical responders to provide additional resources if required.  These potential responders are given tours of the plant and are familiarized with processes at the plant in the event they are called on to provide assistance."

It is assumed that the plant's gas detection system detects the release and sets off the plant's firewater system, which is assumed to knock-down half the vapor.  For this scenario, impact is limited to circle, centered around the vessel, with a radius of 0.2 miles.
