      "SummaryText": "The Skaneateles Water Treatment Plant (Plant) is owned and operated by the City of Syracuse Water Quality Management Division and is located at 20 West Genesee Street, Skaneateles, New York.  The facility stores and uses chlorine and hydrofluorosilicic acid in the treatment process of potable water.  The maximum amount of chlorine on-site at any time is 20,000 pounds: therefore, the facility is subject to the Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is not a listed toxic or flammable substance and is; therefore, not subject to the Accidental Release Prevention Program. \n\n \n\nThe chlorine system at the facility consists of ten chlorine cylinders each containing 2,000 pounds of pressurized liquid chlorine and two (primary and backup) chlorine feed systems for the disinfection of water. Eight cylinders are stored in the primary chlorine feed and storage building. The other two cylinders are stored in the secondary chlorine feed and storage building.  Chlorine gas is transported via vacuum piping to the Main Operations facility. At the Main Operations facility, the chlorine gas is metered into an injector and mixed with potable water supplied from the Town of Skaneateles.  The chlorine solution is distributed to several feed points in the water intake and distribution system.   The system consists of redundant storage, transport and feed equipment.  According to the most recent Yearly Evaluation in 2012, the system consists of industry standard equipment and controls.  A photograph log from pictures taken on a January 16, 2014 site visit documents the current condition of the facilities.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) update, two release scenarios were modeled.  The worst-case release scenario for this Plant is the loss of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder over 10 minutes under Stability Class F conditions with passive mitigation (containers are stored within a building).  Under this scenario, a radius of 0.9 miles including 2,500 residents w"

      "SummaryText": "ould be affected by the chlorine gas at an end concentration of 3 ppm.\n\n\n\nBased on input from Plant personnel, the selected alternative release scenario consists of a release from a 1-ton container at a fusible plug that is 0.785 square inches in diameter, located approximately 18 inches below the liquid column for 1 minute. The alternative release scenario is also a release that would occur inside the building.  Under this scenario, a radius of 0.6 miles including 1,800 residents would be affected by the chlorine gas at an end point concentration of 3 ppm.\n\n\n\nSince the last RMP update, the Skaneateles Plant has installed an updated chlorine gas detector. The system will automatically call the appropriate personnel in the event of an emergency.  Additionally, Plant operators use an upgraded style of respirator.\n\n\n\nThe Skaneateles Plant has not experienced any accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.  The Skaneateles Plant is subject to OSHA Process Safety requirements and has documented all of its prevention program elements in the RMP documentation which is maintained and updated at the Plant.  The RMP contains information on the process and chemical safety data, employee training, operating procedures, management review of process changes, accident investigation procedures, compliance and safety audits, permits, and employee participation on contractor safety.  The Plant actively coordinates emergency situations and accidental release scenarios with the local fire and police departments, the hazardous material response team, and the chlorine distributor and manufacturer.  In the event of an emergency release or potential release, Plant personnel are instructed to evacuate the site and contact the police and fire departments.  The Skaneateles Police Department would then execute implementation of a community evacuation plan.\n\n"
