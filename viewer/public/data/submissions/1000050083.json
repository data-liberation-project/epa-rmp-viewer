Since two of the four regulated substances are subject to the OSHA PSM Standard, the chemicals are consequently subject to the Program 3 release prevention steps.  As a result, the PSM Standard has been implemented for all applicable chemicals to improve safety and facilitate administration of the program under one accidental release prevention program.  The elements, summarized in the CalARP Program Manual, Chapter 7 (Prevention Program), include all requirements under the OSHA PSM Standard.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last (5) years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nShore Chemical Company maintains an Emergency Action Plan as described in the CalARP Program Manual.  The emergency response measures primarily include the safe evacuation of all personnel and notification to outside emergency responders.  Incidental releases that do not pose an imminent safety hazard may be abated by employees who are trained to provide such a response, are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), are authorized and trained by Shore Chemical Company to perform such activities, and are in the area of the release at the time of discovery.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nModifications to these storage processes are implemented through the Management of Change program component as a result of Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, Compliance Audit findings, Incident Investigations, regulatory audits, and self-discovery.  Deficiencies are scheduled for correction and completed in a timely manner."

      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating and implementing our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the CalARP and EPA Program regulations.  This comprehensive program has been developed to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve the covered chemicals.\r\n\r\nThis CalARP and EPA Risk Management Program will be regularly reviewed and updated as required, and whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures.  This Program document, as well as the other documents and reports that are created pursuant to this Program, will be accessible to our employees and made available to other affected persons in accordance with applicable requirements and the provisions of the CalARP Program.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policy at this facility supports proper external notification and evacuation procedures for a facility that will not attempt to abate uncontrolled releases of these substances but will, instead, rely upon the fire department and county Hazardous Materials Response Team.\r\n\r\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the regulation.  We shall, at a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of process hazard analyses, (2) consult with employees and their representatives on the development of the other elements of accidental release prevention, and (3) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under the regulation.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable fede"
