Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe Woodward Gas Plant (Facility) is one of many facilities operated OFS.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing a 65,000,000 cubic feet per day cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  There is a product surge tank with a maximum capacity of 65,474 gallons, which contains demethanized product.  This demethanized product is the only flammable substance at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity that is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  There are no RMP-covered toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include the following:\r\n\r\n* We installed a continuously-lit flare system that will burn off any hydrocarbon vapor when high pressure is encountered within the plant.  All relief valves in the plant are piped by a common header to the flare.  Therefore, a release to atmosphere from a relief valve can not occur.\r\n \r\n* We provided manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons (which are tested semiannually) at several locations within the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipeline.   \r\n \r\n* We installed gas detectors in the compressor room and near the product surge tank and pumps in order to detect flammable hydrocarbon vapors and alarm the control room.\r\n \r\n* We provided dual seals on the booster pumps with an alarm in the control room to detect any leakage from the primary seal.\r\n \r\n* We provided high pressure and low-flow shutdown switches on our product pipeline as well as high pressure shutdown on the demethanizer that will vent hydroc"

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n \r\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Woodward Gas Plant with the Woodward Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Woodward County Sheriff, the Woodward Hospital, and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.  The Woodward Gas Plant Operator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Program (ERP) for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, and training.  Our ERP provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n \r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Woodward Gas Plant.
