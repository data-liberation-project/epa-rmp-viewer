The facility receives propane by tanker truck at one offloading location, stores the propane in one 30,000 gallon pressure vessel, and delivers propane into the Mariner East II pipeline (MEII). \n\n\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Independence Truck Load-Out:\n\n\n\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Sunoco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Independence Truck Load-Out, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for neighbors in the community. Sunoco, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Chartiers Township Volunteer Fire Department and the Washington County Department of Public Safety.\n\n\n\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Independence Truck Load-Out is to act as an Liquefied petroleum gas storage facility.  Due to the flammable effects associated with propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Sunoco Pipeline, L.P. - Independence Truck Load-Out is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which LPG is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to"

Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nFor planning purposes, Sunoco has considered the impact of worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  The probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. the worst-case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the 0.4 mile radius has been incorporated into Sunoco's notification and emergency response planning. Sunoco also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment. \n\n\n\nSunoco has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Sunoco has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. Sunoco provides annual emergency response training to its employees. Sunoco's management is committed to the following:\n\n\n\n- Preventing accidents;\n\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Sunoco operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n- Being a good corporate citizen in Washington County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about the management of the risks associated with the Liquefied petroleum gas storage process. Most importantly, Sunoco stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe operation for  employees, our visitors and our community."
