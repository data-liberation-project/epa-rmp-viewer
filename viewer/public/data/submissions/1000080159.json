This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n \r\n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant is located in Smith County, near Winona, Texas.  This facility operates processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, ethane, propane, butane) from natural gas.  The Chapel Hill Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n \r\n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The gas plant process is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses the elements of the Chapel Hill Gas Plant's accident prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n \r\n Employee Participation\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas p"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element.  \r\n \r\n Process Safety Information\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.    \r\n \r\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the Chapel Hill Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n \r\n The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n \r\n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant has a comprehensive pro"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis, performed by trained and knowledgeable personnel is recognized as an extremely thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n \r\n The PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n \r\n To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n \r\n Operating Proc"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed for completeness and accuracy.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \r\n \r\n In addition, the Chapel Hill Gas Plant Operating Procedures Manual also contains a section pertaining to the consequences of deviation which provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n \r\n Training\r\n \r\n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chapel Hill Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests or skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically will be re-certified on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This re-certification is conducted every 3 years.  All of this training is documented fo"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:   (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Chapel Hill Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n \r\n Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review personnel uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n \r\n Maintenance personnel receive training, as required, on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \r\n \r\n Safe Work Practices\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n \r\n Incident Investigation\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \r\n \r\n \r\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas P"

      "SummaryText": "lant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.   Due to the active involvement of plant management and personnel in the accident prevention programs described above there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n \r\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n \r\n The Chapel Hill Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Chapel Hill Gas Plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n \r\n The overall emergency response program for the Chapel Hill Gas Plant is coordinated with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Chapel Hill Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying t"
