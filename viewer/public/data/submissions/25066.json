      "SummaryText": "and storage warehouse for the perishable food industry.  This facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing  capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in each system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum combined inventory of both system is 48,000 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from both systems could pose a risk of offsite public impact and both systems are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\nThe closed ammonia refrigeration system removes heat from the storage and blast freezers of the 4.8 million cubic foot facility.  Two refrigeration systems provide two-stage and single-stage operation with screw compressors for the -35\u00a1 blast and -10\u00a1 freezers.  The sub-zero temperatures are provided with low pressure ammonia suction and liquid lines via pumped recirculating accumulators.  The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\nC.\tSummary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\nThe same Worst Case Release Scenario is developed for each of the two refrigeration systems.  The Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from V-1 receiver.  The V-1 Receiver operates at 77\u00a1F. (ambient temperature) and approximately 131 psig.\nThe System J#1 main ammonia receiver is 3.9 feet in diameter and 17.6 feet tall.  When 50% filled, the receiver capacity is approximately 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\nThe System #2 main ammonia receiver is 4 feet in diameter and 18 feet tall.  When 50% filled, the receiver capacity is approximately 4,300"

Using EPA-default parameter values, the full content of the receiver is released within ten minutes through a 0.55-inch hole and a 0.58-inch hole in the System #1 and System #2 receivers, respectfully.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the distance from source to toxic endpoint is 0.74 miles and 0.76 miles for System #1 and System #2 failures, respectfully.\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these receivers and vessels;\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\nPressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these receivers and vessels and have design margins of safety of about 4 to 1.\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\nAn Alternative Release Scenario is chosen as a pipe failure.  The potential for a pipe failure is significant given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility.\nAssumed is the failure of a four-inch pipe connected to the main receiver.  The pipe is 100 feet long with a smooth interior.  The receiver serves as an infinite source of anhydrous ammonia at 77\u00a1F. and 131 pounds per square inch.  Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative conditions, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 0.64 miles.  This scenario applies equally to by System #1 and System #2.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\nVessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\nActive mitigation considered w"
