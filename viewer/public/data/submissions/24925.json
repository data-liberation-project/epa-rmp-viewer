      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOrganic Technologies is committed to safety.  Each production process that is employed by the company is reviewed in detail prior to initiation or any process changes.  Safety concerns arising during the process review are evaluated and mitigated by either implementing engineering controls, ongoing safety checks and updates to operating procedures.  All employees are trained in safe operating procedures and designated employees are trained in emergency response procedures.  Thus, the facility is committed to addressing all safety and environmental concerns from senior management down to personnel involved in line operations.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nOrganic Technologies' primary business is the manufacture of organic food flavorings, food additives, and a broad range of specialty products.  The facility has the capability to produce lab, pilot, semi bulk, and bulk quantities of materials.  Operations utilize tanks, pumps, stirred vessels, and distillation systems.  Chloroform is produced, purified, and marketed as a pure product.  It is purified by distillation and stored on site prior to shipment.  Approximately 160,000 lbs. may be on site at any given time.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario would result from a failure of a 30,000 gallon above ground storage tank containing chloroform.  Operating procedures limit the amount of chloroform contained in the tank to 11,500 gallons.  Any spill of chloroform from the storage vessel would be collected in a diked area, thus under any circumstances, no liquid chloroform could leave the property.  The dike  limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the release rate to 1,850 lbs. per minute.  The worst case scenario is highly unlikely as employees are trained in rapid shutdown procedures to prevent total loss from the system as well as methods to recover the spilled material before it can be released to the environment.

The residential population in this radius is estimated to be 16,000 persons.\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario would result in the event that the 1/2\" sample valve either fails or is inadvertantly left open.  The scenario was selected because it poses the most likely occurrence of failure.  The dike and overbearing water limits the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduces the release rate to 52.0 lbs. per minute.  The alternative case scenario is unlikely as employees are trained in rapid shutdown procedures to prevent total loss from the system as well as methods to recover the spilled material before it can be released to the environment.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of the alternative case scenario is less than 0.10 miles.  The residential population in this radius is estimated to be less than 190 persons.\n\nThe facility complies with the spill prevention and emergency response provisions contained in the following regulations: 40 CFR 262.34, 40 CFR 265 subparts C and D, 29 CFR 1910.38, and 29 CFR 1910.120.  The facility has integrated the emergency response elements of these regulations into its Integrated Contingency Plan.\n\nThe contingency plan details the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency occurring at the Organic Technologies, Newark, Ohio facility.  The emergency procedures within this Plan must be carried out whenever there is an emergency situation such as a fire, explosion, or release of hazardous wastes or hazardous waste constituents, of hazardous materials that could threaten human health and the environment.\n\nThe plan integrated the requirements of applicable Federal, state, and local regulations as well as the facility's environmental policy following the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance published in the June 06, 1996 Federal Register.\n\nThe contingency plan is coordinated with the Licking County Local Eme"

HAZWOPER training is divided into five levels: First Responder Awareness Level, First Responder Operations Level, Hazmat Technician Level, Hazmat Specialist Level, and On-scene Incident Commander.  All employees will recieve at least awareness level training to understand the response activity limitations imposed on them by this regulation.\n\nThe contingency plan details the procedures for notification of off-site emergency response officials including the LEPC and the Fire Department in the event that a hazardous material is released to the environment or the community.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last five years that have resulted in an off-site impact."
