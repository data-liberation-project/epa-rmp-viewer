      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Foamex LP Plant in Morristown, TN, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce molded polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce automobile parts and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by tank truck, and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in storage tanks at our plant is about 152,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce molded polyurethane foam parts.  \n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's r"

      "SummaryText": "isk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceed EPA's threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\n7 Most people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\n\nWorst case release scenarios.  Rupture of a TDI storage tank, having a capacity of 50,000 pounds would be a worst case release of a toxic substance because the TDI storage tank is the largest single container at the plant.  The TDI is stored at a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The pool area is limited by the dike dimensions to 720 square feet.  Redefined dispersion techniques predict a distance of 36 feet from the storage tank to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007 mg/l).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Releas"

      "SummaryText": "e Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI does not impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor,  (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM), (3) The process has had no release of a regulated substance in the past 5 years where exposure to the substance resulted in one or more offsite deaths, injuries, or response or restoration activities for exposure of an environmental receptor, and (3) Foamex has coordinated it's emergency response activities with the local responders.  \n\n\n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n \n Release detection \n \n- Process Alarms\t\n- Operator Surveillance Activities\n \n Release Containment/Control\n \n- TDI storage tanks are piped to overflow into other vessels\n- Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\n- TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n- Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (e.g. high level, high pressure)\n- Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n- Remote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\n- Magnetic drive TDI centrifugal pumps without seals\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process\n- Vapor from storage tank is piped or hosed to the unloading vessel\n\n \n  Release Mitigation\n \n- Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n- Trained emergency response personnel\n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nWe have had no releases of TDI in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths,"

We have had 1 small release of TDI over the past 5 years.  This release occurred inside an operating building and was too small to result in injuries or significant damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA's emergency action and fire prevention plan regulation, OSHA's hazardous waste and emergency operations regulation, and EPA's emergency response program requirements in its RMP rule.  Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and or trained on those changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes participation in periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as wel"
