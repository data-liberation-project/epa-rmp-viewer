Detailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel. All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site. Small releases can be brought under control immediately. The emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches for the system with the release. If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are identified. The Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include EPA's Risk Management Plan, OSHA's Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's Process Safety Stan"

Second, all Americold's,\r\n    employees (direct hires, contract) receive ammonia awareness \r\n    training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the\r\n    overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation\r\n    Element)\r\n6.

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the\r\n   refrigeration system, an Americold's Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the\r\n   associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.

The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report. Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours. State regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia. Americold interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone. All releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.
