THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 80,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS 1.94 MILES.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.\n\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS 0.29 MILES.  THIS RELEASE HAS THE POSSIBLITY OF EXTENDING BEYOND THE FACILITY BOUNDARY.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\nTHIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTAL PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.
