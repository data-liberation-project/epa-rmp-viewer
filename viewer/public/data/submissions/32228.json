      "SummaryText": "The Minn-Dak Yeast Company is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from any hazardous substances used in its yeast manufacturing process, specifically aqueous ammonia.  It is the policy of Minn-Dak Yeast Company to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Minn-Dak Yeast Company operates a yeast manufacturing facility located in Wahpeton, Richland County, North Dakota.  Aqueous ammonia, at 30% concentration, is a key component in the manufacture of yeast.  The liquid ammonia is fed into the sealed process and is completely used during the process.  The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored on-site is 120,000 pounds.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, the Minn-Dak Yeast Company has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Minn-Dak Yeast Company has had one aqueous ammonia related injury occur to one of its employees.  The injury was not serious, a momentary exposure to ammonia vapor, and was due to a process valve failure.  No ammonia accidents causing death, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering have occurred in the last five years at the yeast manufacturing facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of the Minn-Dak Yeast Company to notify the local (City of Wahpeton) Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility."
