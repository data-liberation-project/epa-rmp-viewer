      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Chaucer refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Chaucer to be in compliance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety at Chaucer is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined\r\nwith appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility. We have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM requirements in Title 29 of CFR 1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, consistent with Oregon Administrative Rules 432-002-0042. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables\r\nthose who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Substances Handled\r\nChaucer is a manufacturing facility that freeze dries fruits and vegetables. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the processed foods. This\r\nrefrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized team members, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nChaucer complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regula"

      "SummaryText": "tions. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or government organizations. Chaucer's written PSM plan incorporates policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include team member participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Chaucer personnel.\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each team member involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system. This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia. Startup, shutdown and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents at Chaucer in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\nChaucer has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It\r\ncomplies with the provisions of OR-OSHA 432-002-0042. This Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.\r\nThis enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.

Chaucer has completed a process hazard analysis to identify recommendations to reduce the risk of an accident. Higher priority items are scheduled to be completed before the end of 2018. Lower priority items will be addressed before the next scheduled analysis in 2022."
