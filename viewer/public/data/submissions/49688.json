The EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n2) OSHA\u00bfs Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, \u00bfEmergency Action Plans\u00bf, 29CFR 1910.39, \u00bfFire Prevention Plans\u00bf, 29 CFR 1910.119, \u00bfProcess Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\u00bf and 29 CFR 1910.120, \u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\u00bf\n3) National Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58, \u00bfLiquified Petroleum Gas Code\u00bf and NFPA 54, \u00bfNational Fuel Gas Code\u00bf.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSince the initial RMP submission, the site has upgraded process controls and metering systems, and installed dedicated propane transfer lines.  In addition, the odorant injection system was upgraded in order to significantly reduce fugitive emissions and minor leaks, thereby reducing odor complaints.   Upgrades to the site\u00bfs UV/IR fire detection and its gas detection systems have just recently been completed, improving leak detection response time and system reliability.  In progress is a project to replace the existing truck rack loading arms in order to further reduce fugitive gas emissions and potential odor complaints."

      "SummaryText": "Facility Background and Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nAt the San Pedro facility we handle butane and propane, both of which are recognized by the EPA as regulated, flammable substances.  The same properties that make butane and propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in their handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel or Chem trec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute butane and propane to wholesale customers.  Butane is received and/or distributed to customers by pipeline, railcar, ship or transport trucks.  Butane is stored in two refrigerated storage tanks, each bulk tank having a nominal capacity of 13 million gallons.  In addition, butane is also stored in two smaller horizontal vessels, each with a nominal capacity of 60,000 gallons.  Propane is"

The facility is equipped to load or offload ships, railcars and transport trucks as needed.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\nThe facility is connected by pipeline to a dock in the Port of Los Angeles and currently loads 2 to 6 ships per year with butane for export.\n\nThe maximum amount of butane that can be stored on site is 120 millions pounds.  For propane, the maximum inventory that can be stored on site is 640,000 pounds.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries and releases at the facility.  Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via extensive inspection and painting programs.  \n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, the site is also equipped with modern leak detection systems comprised of Ultraviolet (UV) and Infrared (IR) fire detection sensors that alert personnel should a leak and fire occur.  These sensors are located at strategic points throughout the facility and work in conjunction with shutdown systems and emergency response equipment also installed on site.  Shutdown systems include automatic positive shutoff valves and other cri"

In addition, a continuously operating flare is in service on site to minimize gas emissions to the atmosphere during normal and upset conditions.\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations, including California\u00bfs requirements for seismic activity study and design.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.  \n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association\u00bfs (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility is considered a non-responding location with no toxic substances on-site and as such is not required to maintain an Emergency Response Plan.  As a non-responding facility, the site maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which includes procedures for the notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.  Notification of any potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel.  Should an actual incident occur, the EAP gives guidance to employees on when and how to respond to minor incidents, incidental spills and small fires.  Larger emergencies require the assistance of local emergency response agencies, including the Los Angeles Fire Department and on-site personnel are knowledgeab"
