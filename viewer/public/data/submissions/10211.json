The released propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud and only 10% of the vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in an explosion.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be a propane truck pulling away from the loading rack while still connected, and the released propane causing a vapor cloud fire.  This scenario was identified in the hazard analysis as being more likely than the worst case, it could reach an endpoint offsite, and is one of the applicable alternative release scenarios listed in the regulations.  The excess flow valve on the propane storage tank is assumed to function to stop the release and limit the released quantity of propane to only 69 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nWholesale Fuels, Inc. has integrated the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) Prevention Program 2 elements within a comprehensive environmental management system, incorporating all applicable emergency response, planning, and prevention requirements under the \"One Plan\" format.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWholesale Fuels, Inc. has not had an accidental release of propane during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWholesale Fuels, Inc. uses a comprehensive environmental management system approach to integrate both accidental release prevention and emergency response requirements und"
