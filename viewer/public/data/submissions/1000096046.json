The Henderson site follows the Corporate Crisis Management Plan  5.1.2 and its own Emergency Response plan.\n\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Olin Henderson facility.  Liquefied chlorine is received in rail cars and used in the manufacture of bleach. Olin has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the Federal RMP Prevention Program, Nevada CAPP and OSHA Process Safety Management (\u0093PSM\u0094) requirements.   We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.  The site also maintains a caustic scrubber to prevent accidental releases. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe Henderson Bleach Plant has had no releases in its 5-year history meeting the definition.  All releases are tracked through the company Action Management Tool (AMT) on the Olin Chlor Alkali home page.  Investigations are managed online and any resulting corrective and preventative actions are tracked to closure using AMT.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nOlin has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installation of detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.   Olin has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  Olin Henderson coordinates with the Henderson Fire De"
