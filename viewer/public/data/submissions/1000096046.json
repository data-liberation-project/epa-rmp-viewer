An 14-mile radius circle surrounding the facility includes all of Henderson, a portion of southern and eastern Las Vegas, and portions of Boulder City. The area encompassed by the circle contains most types of urban land use, as well as large areas of undeveloped and mountainous terrain\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Henderson bleach facility is committed to the safety and well-being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment. Olin is an active member of the local CAER group which facilitates mutual emergency response between agencies and local partners.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source\r\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Olin's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Olin Henderson facility.\r\n\r\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water to eliminate and/or prevent the growth of harmful organisms.\r\n\r\nThe maximum intended inventory is managed only through railcar space on the site spur. The maximum number of railcars that can be stored onsite is 400, but chlorine invento"

Ordering specifications limit the container available to ensure that no more than 90-ton can be available in one container at any time.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOlin has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the Federal RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") requirements.  The site has physical safeguards in place to prevent a release of chlorine.  We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.  The site has also implemented administrative controls such as operating procedures to operate the plant within safe limits and training to ensure that operators are competent to operate the processes and equipment as designed.\r\n\r\nIn addition and in compliance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program NRS 459.30-459.3874, and EPA's 40 CFR 68 RMP requirements, the Olin comprehensive accident release program elements include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nManagement of Change\r\nPre Start Up Reviews\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nHot Work\r\nContractor Safety\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nLife Critical Permits, such as: Hot Work Permits, Hazardous Energy Permits, Line Break Permits, and Safe Work Permits.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe 5-year accidental release history as described in 40 CFR 68.42(a) must include all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,"

Any releases are tracked through the company Action Management Tool (AMT) on the Olin Chlor Alkali home page.  Investigations are managed online and any resulting corrective and preventative actions are tracked to closure using AMT.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nOlin has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes the installation of detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Olin has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  Olin Henderson has worked closely with the Henderson Fire Department as well as other local agencies in developing its Emergency Response Plan.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nOlin has made significant changes to improve safety, including the expansion of both the coverage and functionality of the chlorine monitor system, the addition of video surveillance cameras, upgrades to the chlorine vent and recycle system and additional interlocks and automatic shutdown devices.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nOlin has a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and local agencies\r\n\r\n\r\nPioneer Americas LLC, dba Olin Chlor Alkali Products\r\nHenderson Nevada"
