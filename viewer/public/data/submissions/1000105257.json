Based on 40 CFR 68.42(a), the five-year accident history covers only releases that have caused on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe Mill reported an accidental release of ClO2 on September 13, 2022 at approximately 8:00 a.m.  1,043 pounds of ClO2 were released from a process vessel over a 28-minute period. The release  was due to human error, with maintenance activity and process design failure as contributing factors. The release resulted in one employee injury, but did not result in property or environmental damage. As a result of the accident, equipment was upgraded and new process controls were implemented. If an accidental release should occur of this nature in the future, this section of the Risk Management Program will be updated.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nAn Emergency Response Team, capable of providing multiple emergency response functions, is available at the Mill.

Contractor employees must pass a written exam upon completion of the safety orientation to document proficiency with the presented material.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response: \nThe Mill has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. A formal review process to solicit employees\u2019 input on Mill-wide procedures exists to improve emergency response plans. Employees and participants in both safety incidents and drills conduct critiques to obtain comments and observations, identify learnings, identify opportunities for performance improvement, and improve both emergency response planning and responder performance. Communication with team members and contractors occurs on formal and informal levels to ensure complete understanding of the required actions in the event of an emergency. The written plan, which is consistent with the approach in the National Response Team\u2019s Integrated Contingency Plan Guidance (\u201cOne Plan\u201d), contains:\n\u2022\tProcedures for informing the surrounding public and local emergency response agencies in the event of an accidental release from the Mill,\n\u2022\tDocumentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment of accidental human exposure,\n\u2022\tProcedures for emergency response after an accidental release,\n\u2022\tProcedures for the use of emergency response equipment,\n\u2022\tProcedures for reviewing and updating the plan, as necessary, and\n\u2022\tTraining for all employees in relevant procedures.\n\nThe Mill maintains emergency planning and response written procedures onsite.\n\nTrade Secrets: \nMill employees have access to information developed to meet the requirements of the OSHA PSM Rule.

Team members communicate observations made during normal work conditions and report and identified operational safety concerns.\n\nHot Work Permits (Safe Work Practices): \nThe Mill has established a hot work permit program to control activities that may result in a fire or explosion in covered processes. Team members with appropriate and adequate skills and experience participate in the review of safe work practices through their involvement with safety sub-teams, the Mill safety core team, and ad-hoc task teams.

An issued permit will document that the fire prevention and protection requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252 have been implemented prior to the beginning of hot work operations. The permit will indicate the dates authorized for hot work and identify the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed. The permit will be kept on file until completion of hot work operations.\n\nContractors: \nThe Mill has established a program to ensure that contractor activities  are performed in a safe manner.

As the worst-case scenario is very unlikely, the OCA guidance also requires an alternative release scenario to be examined. The alternative release scenario is based on a more likely accidental release situation that would result in the toxic substance reaching an off-site endpoint.  \n\nThe distances to toxic endpoint for ClO2 from the Mill were determined using the U.S. EPA\u2019s Dense Gas Dispersion Model (DEGADIS) and the OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations. DEGADIS simulates atmospheric dispersion of a ground-level dense gas, released into the atmospheric boundary layer over flat, level terrain. The methodology follows OCA guidance and uses the associated equations for releases of toxic liquids with passive mitigation.\n\nHazard Assessment, Worst Case Scenario:\nThe selected worst-case release scenario considers two 94,000-gallon storage tanks that are both  completely full prior to a release of their full quantities simultaneously. Although the Guidance allows for an evaluation of a single vessel, the possibility of a catastrophic event damaging the area in which the tanks will be maintained, and therefore causing a release of both tanks, must be considered.

A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals. Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the releases.  \n\nThe Mill is located on approximately 3,000 acres of land in southern Lowndes County, Mississippi.  Approximately 350 employees work to keep the Mill safely operating at peak efficiency up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. The Mill uses two refrigerated storage tanks with a volume of 94,000 gallons each to hold a chlorine dioxide (ClO2) solution used to bleach kraft pulp. The ClO2 generator is capable of manufacturing approximately 600 gallons per minute at a concentration of 11.2 grams per liter (g/L). This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Chlorine dioxide is the only RMP-covered substance used, manufactured, or stored on the Mill site in quantities above the designated Threshold Quantity.\n\nThe Mill has a primary goal of operating in 100% compliance with existing environmental regulations, which includes accurate and timely reporting and striving for steady reduction of environmental impacts. The Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nTo protect the environment and the health and safety of employees and the public, the Mill expects full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
