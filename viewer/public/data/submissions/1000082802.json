All transfers of ammonia are observed by Andersons personnel.\r\n\r\nTransfers from the bulk storage tank to the production system occur inside fixed steel pipes.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Needle valves are used to control the rate of flow into the mixers.\r\n\r\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\r\n\r\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented\r\n\r\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Upper Sandusky facility are:\r\n1.\tBulkhead breakaway unit located on the connection point to the storage tank anchors the ammonia plumbing into the ground. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the bulkhead piping, the hose would break at the outside of the connection point.  An excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the delivery truck tank from emptying to the atmosphere.  Storage tank excess flow valves are installed at the tank openings.\r\n\r\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to funct"

      "SummaryText": "ion.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Upper Sandusky facility are:\r\n1.\tExcess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  These valves close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\r\n2.\tBack check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tank.  These valves are installed at the receiving manifold and are integral to the site flow indicator on the liquid fill line at the manifold. Back check valves are also installed at each mixer to prevent mixer products from entering the NH3 lines.\r\n3.\tPressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\r\n4.\tMixer automation interlocks are installed at mixers 6 and 7.

      "SummaryText": "The Andersons, Inc.\r\nUpper Sandusky Facility\r\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\r\n\r\nSource and Product Description\r\n\r\nThe Upper Sandusky facility is located in Crane Township, Wyandot County. The facility sets on the south side of County Hwy 49, between SR 199 and US Route 30.  The facility is bordered by railroad tracks to the west, a farm field to the south, wooded lot to the east and a vacant parking lot (owned by The Andersons) to the north.  There are no residences within a \u00bc mile of this facility.  \r\n\r\nFacility operations include the manufacturing and distribution of wholesale of agricultural and industrial products.  Products are manufactured on site and then sold in bulk quantities, as well as 2\u00bd gallon containers and 50 or 55 lb bags. The plant employs 40 full time workers and normal operating hours are 8:00 am to 5:00 p.m. five days a week, however there are second and third shifts for production.\r\n\r\nSite management names and emergency contact information are posted on a sign at the entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only RMP regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  A 12,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 10,200 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tank.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas under most conditions.\r\n\r\nSummary of Major Hazards\r\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck) to the bulk storage tank.  Flexible h"

Issues are documented in a report and sent to the facility manager and upper management.  Updates on action item status must be made regularly.\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been completed at the Upper Sandusky facility, as part of their Process Safety Management program.  The analysis will be updated every five years, or as changes in the process are made.  PHA's are performed using the HazOp technique and analyze all aspects involved in the receiving, storage and utilization of anhydrous ammonia.  The evaluation team includes representatives from the corporate Safety Department, location management and operations employees.\r\n\r\nEach operating parameter is discussed and evaluated.  Unless otherwise noted, situations are evaluated under the assumption that safety controls are in effect.  Potential consequences are listed and given a rating of 1 - 4 for severity and likelihood; with 1 being the worst case and 4 being none or very low.  When plotted, a risk value is assigned from A - D; with A being the worst and most critical item and D being of least consequence.
