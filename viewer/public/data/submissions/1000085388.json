The prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n- Empoyee Participation\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Employee Training\r\n- Contractor Safety\r\n- Pre-startup Safety Review Procedures\r\n- Mechanical Integrity (Preventative Maintenance Program)\r\n- Hot Work Permit (Non-routine Work Authorizations)\r\n- Management of Change Procedures\r\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\r\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\r\n\r\n\r\nD.  Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo ammonia-related incidents have occurred at the Easton facility over the past five years that resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.  Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the Easton facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  This program has been coordinated with the Easton fire department.\r\n\r\n\r\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAll ammonia releases, regardless of size, are investigated following incident investigation procedures.  The objective is to identify recommendations that will prevent these releases from re-occurring.  Safety improvements are made to equipment and procedures using this technique to continually improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration systems at the Easton facility."

      "SummaryText": "McCain Foods USA, Inc. is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.\r\n\r\nMcCain Foods, Easton facility is a potato processing plant which produces frozen potato products, such as french fries and tater tots, for the retail and service markets. Ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMcCain Foods uses many precautionary measures to prevent or minimize the accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration systems.  These precautions include built in safety systems that will generate alarms or automatically shut down the refrigeration system if design limitations are exceeded (eg. Pressures, temperatures, or vessel operating levels).  These safety systems in conjunction with PLC automated control ensure that system operates within safe limits minimizing the chance for an ammonia release to occur.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive Preventative Maintenance program is used to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of all equipment in the refrigeration systems and mechanics and operators are trained to maintenance and operating procedures to minimize the chance of human error and to maintain a well informed and qualified group of refrigeration personnel.    \r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\r\n\r\nThere are two ammonia refrigeration systems at the Easton facility.  Ammonia is the only substance handled at the Easton facility covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.  \r\n\r\n\r\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Easton facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program regulat"
