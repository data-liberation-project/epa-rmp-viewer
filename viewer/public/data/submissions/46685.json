In brief, the policies include periodic inspection and documentation of the integrity of the butane storage and delivery system. The facility maintains a listing of emergency response numbers. This list includes the local as well as state response activities. The primary objective of the plan is to protect the health and well being of facility employees. \n\nThe company uses butane (CAS# 106-97-8) in compound mixes as a blowing (expanding) agent in the production of foam containers. The butane is stored in two (2) storage tanks located away from traffic and public accessibility. The perimeter is secured. Access into the storage area is limited to only authorized personnel. The tanks are on concrete saddles inside a diked area. This protects against expansion and release of material. The storage system consists of two external steel tanks. The system was designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with the storage and use requirements of the Steel Tank Institute. As furtherance of these policies, butane sensors have been installed within and without the facility to warn of any releases. In addition, the company has acquired a portable sensing device and conducts facility wide testing. Any indications of a release would result in evacuation of the facility and notification to the local response authorities. \n\nThe distance to the flammability endpoint for a worst case and alternate case release scenario was calculated using RMP*COMP. This assessment has determined that the distance to a public receptor is within the range of the impact area. The facility has taken additional steps to mitigate any off-site migration of a release by locating the tanks in an area protected on the eastern and southern walls of the facility thereby forcing any release with prevailing winds away"

      "SummaryText": " from public receptors. In addition, The company maintains storage capacity at 85%. \n\nThe plan is reviewed annually by use of Hazard Review Forms and Maintenance Inspection forms through an outside agent familiar with Steel Tank Storage Requirements. Any suggestions or recommendations resulting from those inspections will result in a review of the various response plans. In addition, there is a facility accident investigation program that requires the facility manager to review and amend the response plans as necessary.\n\nThe major hazard associated with butane is flammability. Therefore, the storage and dispensing systems were designed to prevent leakage. All piping, regulators and other apparatus are kept tight and confirmed through the use of a compatible leak solution or leak detection instruments.\n\nPlanned safety improvements include the installation of 6 additional flammable gas sensors in the butane storage tank diked area.\n\nSpecific employee response actions, to be taken in the event of a spill or release, require immediate notification to the facility manager. The facility manager, or his designee, will notify the regulatory and response authorities immediately."
