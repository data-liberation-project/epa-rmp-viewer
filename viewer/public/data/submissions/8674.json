THE PROCESSING SEASON BEGINS IN MID-JUNE AND CONCLUDES IN OCTOBER. AT THE CONCLUSION OF PROCESSING THE AMMONIA IS PUMPED BACK TO PRESSURE VESSELS FOR REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.  15% OF THE AMMONIA SYSTEM IS DEDICATED TO COLD STORAGE OPERATION WHICH OPERATES YEAR ROUND. THE AMMONIA SYSTEM CONSISTS OF SINGLE STAGE AND TWO STAGE SYSTEMS. THE SYSTEM WAS REPLACED AS NEW  IN 1992-1993. THE SYSTEM CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 30,000 LBS. OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR THE REFRIGERATION .\n     THE REFRIGERATION IS OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY THREE OPERATING ENGINEERS ALL MEMBERS OF THE OPERATING ENGINEERS UNION. THE ENGINEERS PERFORM MOST MAINTENANCE TASKS. IF ASSISTANCE IS REQUIRED SUBCONTRACTORS ARE BROUGHT IN.\n     THE ENGINEERS RESPONSE EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF RADIOS,SCBA'S, CANNISTER MASKS, CONFINED SPACE KIT,CLASS A SUITS,AND MONITORS.\n     OPERATING PROCEEDURES , PARAMETERS,HAZOPS ,ETC.
