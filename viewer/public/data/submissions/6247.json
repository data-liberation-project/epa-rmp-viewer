Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Merced - Wastewater Treatment Facility handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are considered hazardous materials and are regulated substances under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and are considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facilitys workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facilitys policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility is a 10 million gallons per day treatment plant for wastewater from domestic and industrial sources.  The plant design has conventional primary treatment which screens coarse materials and removes grit and settleable organic solids.  There is a conventional secondary treatment which removes soluble organic material and additional suspended organic solids.  There is a solids handling system with dissolved flotation thickening of the waste activated sludge, anaerobic digestion of the primary and secondary organic sludges, dewatering of the digested sludge using drying lagoons, and final disposal by land application.  \n\nDisinfection and dechlorination of the wastewater is performed prior to discharge.  The effluent leaving the secondary treatment contains large numbers of biological organisms.  Some of these may be pathogenic (disease causing) organisms.  The effluent is disinfected to protect the public health by the use of a chlorine solution produced"

      "SummaryText": " at the plant by mixing chlorine gas and water.  The chlorine contact basin provides detention time for the chlorine to disinfect the treated wastewater.  Approximately 30 minutes of contact time is possible at the design maximum of 23.0 MGD prior to final discharge.\n\nSome residual chlorine is present after disinfection and represents a toxic hazard.  The chlorine is neutralized to remove this threat by the addition of sulfur dioxide, i.e., dechlorination.\n\nThere is a daily maximum of 24,000 lb of chlorine and 8,000 lb of sulfur dioxide at the facility.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for interconnected equipment must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on site in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vessels contents and usage as per the CCR Title 19 Division 2 Chapter 4.5 Article 2 Section 2750.3 (b).\n\nThe one ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the chlorine feed system.  The one ton container is, at most, filled with 2,000 lb of liquid chlorine which is 67% of tank capacity.  The Worst Case release scenario for the one ton container of chlorine is the release of the 2,000 lb of chlorine at the rate of 200 lb/min for 10 minutes.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Worst Case scenario for the chlorine one ton container will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe one ton container of sulfur dioxide is the largest vessel in the sulfur dioxide feed system.

      "SummaryText": "ease Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for the one ton container of chlorine is complete failure and separation of a < inch dia. fuse plug insert.  The loss from the one ton container will continue until the liquid contents left in the one ton container solidify due to the withdrawal of the Heat of Vaporization by the escaping chlorine vapor and/or the level of liquid chlorine drops to just below the bottom of the hole left by the missing fuse plug insert.  This amounts to a loss of 1,813 lb of liquid chlorine from the one ton container which flashes to vapor.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario for the chlorine one ton container is will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for the one ton container of sulfur dioxide is complete failure and separation of a < inch dia. fuse plug insert.

Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum, the amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide lost from a one ton container if an accidental release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine process system and the sulfur dioxide process system, and the training provided to the operators of these c"

Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine and the sulfur dioxide process systems and their related equipment and components. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facilitys main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Merced - Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Merced County - Environmental Health incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are planned to be implemented over the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine and sulfur dioxide process systems.
