The Risk Management Plan (\u00bfPlan\u00bf) summarizes the administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.  The plan is organized to correspond to EPA RMP requirements, including:\n\nIntroduction\nOzark\u00bfs policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\nFacility identification and regulated processes;\nHazard Assessment;\nPrevention Program;\nFive-Year Accident History;\nEmergency Response Plan; and\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nOzark\u00bfs Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Ozark.  This Plan formalizes and documents health and safety activities.  Ozark is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to the public health and environment.\n\nOzark\u00bfs commitment to health, environment and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Operating Officer.  Senior management of Ozark and its parent company, Toxco, Incorporated routinely dedicate time to review HES matters.  This emphasis is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement for its employees and contractors.\n\nOzark\u00bfs HES program includes policies, procedures, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Ozark\u00bfs commitment to environmental protection.  The program includes RMP guidance to assist our facilities in the prevention of accidental releases and mitigating their effects on the surrounding community.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Processes \n\nOzark is located at 5101 West 21st Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The plant currently manufactures the following chemicals: \n\nhexafluorophosphoric acid (HPF6), difluorophosphoric acid (HPO2F2), potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6), sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F), ammonium bifluoride (NH4HF2), sodium hexafluoroantimonate (NaSbF6), stannous fluoride (SnF2), tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (C8H20BF4N), sodium fluoride (NaF), ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6), ferric fluoride (FeF3) and antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).\n\nOzark has recently expanded their facility to include the following chemicals:\n\nlithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), lithium fluoride (LiF), ferric fluoride (FeF3),  tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (C8H20BF4N).\n\nThe maximum capacity of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is 100,000 pounds (lbs).  The maximum capacity of ethyl ether is 46,800 lbs.\n\nHazard Assessment \u00bf Worst Case Scenarios\n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per hazardous substance\nhandled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program applicability.  Ozark has chosen to use \nSLAB to determine offsite impacts of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and the US Army TNT equivalency model to determine the impacts of the ethyl ether.  \n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release for toxic substances would occur in the event that the largest hydrogen fluoride (100,000-pound) storage vessel would rupture and the entire contents would be released to the atmosphere.  This spill was modeled as a dense-gas jet release because studies (Spicer and Havens, 1988) have shown the release of hydrogen fluoride from a pressurized vessel results in a denser-than-air aerosol.  The contents of the vessel are assumed to release in 10 minutes.  The SLAB release model results indicate a worst-case impact of 5.67 miles for the facility.  The rule defines the toxic endpoint of hydrogen fluoride to be 16 micro"

Although Ozark maintains active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating the worst-case scenario.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario associated with a release of flammable substances at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the ethyl ether storage tank.  A full vessel inventory of 46,800 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE. According to the TNT model results, the maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for this scenario is 0.59 miles.  The potentially affected population (based on 2000 census data) is 930 people.  \n\nHazard Assessment \u00bf Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nAlternative case scenarios (ACS) were performed for anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and ethyl ether that are more likely than the worst-case scenarios, but could potentially impact the public.  The ACS for hydrogen fluoride is a failure of a coupling on the truck unloading line should the truck move while connected.  About 376 pounds of hydrogen fluoride would be released in a 3-minute period. The duration is based on an operator (always in attendance during the offload) pushing the emergency stop button, which closes an air-operated valve on the truck end of the liquid piping.  The SLAB model predicts a maximum distance of 0.98 miles and potentially affect 600 people.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario for the flammable substance at this facility is a VCE involving the entire contents of the ethyl ether storage tank. The release is caused by a vacuum condition being created in the tank, which causes an opening of about 24 square inches. The entire contents of the tank, about 46,800 pounds, are released over a period of 30 minutes through th"

The maximum distance to the EPA defined flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for this scenario is 0.27 miles, which would potentially impact 200 people. \n\nPrevention Programs\n\nThe risk of releases is significantly reduced by designing for safety.  Ozark routinely conducts hazards studies to identify potential incident scenarios and for design changes.  The facility has developed prevention program elements based on the EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility is designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes. \n\nThe plant maintains safety by operating preventative maintenance and leak detection programs for tanks, equipment, and piping.  These programs allow Ozark to identify and repair leaks, conduct mechanical integrity testing to ensure adequate metal thickness, test emergency devices/ safety systems, and using proper procedures to minimize releases during repair.  \n\nFive-year Accident History: \n\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride that resulted in any deaths,significant injuries or property damage on site.  There have been no releases that have caused known off-site conseques (including, but not limited to: deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage). \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility.  The facility actively participates with the Tulsa County Local Emergency Planning committee (LEPC) to coordinate emergency response training and drills at the site.  The Tulsa plant is prepared to respond to accidental releases.  Beyond initiating emergency response from the LEPC, employees that are members of the on-site emergency response team at the facility offer first response to emergencies.  Supervisors and key facility employees have been trained to OSHAs HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level"
