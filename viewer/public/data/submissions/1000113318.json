The requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A \u0096 H. Under the ARP Program, a Stationary Source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process must comply with the requirements of the ARP provisions.\nThe \u0093List Rule\u0094 (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C, and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) identifies regulated substance threshold quantities for determining ARP Program applicability. Threshold quantities have been established for flammable and toxic substances. The threshold quantity for all regulated flammables (Table 3 of the regulation) is 10,000 pounds. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b) (2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight o"

The threshold quantity for regulated toxic substances listed on Table 1 of the regulation varies according to each substance and ranges from 500 \u0096 20,000 pounds.\nEach covered process regulated under the ARP Program is assigned as either a Program 1, 2, or 3 status and must meet the applicable criteria of the assigned program. Program 1 processes are those that meet the following criteria:\n\u00b7\tthe process has not had an accidental release in the past five years that resulted in an offsite consequence (i.e., injuries, deaths, or environmental damage);\n\u00b7\tthe distance to an endpoint is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\n\u00b7\tEmergency response has been coordinated with local emergency response organizations.\n\nProgram 3 processes meet the following criteria:\n\u00b7\tthe distance to an endpoint exceeds the distance to any public receptor; or\n\u00b7\tthe process has had an accidental release in the past five years resulting in an offsite consequence; and either.\n\u00b7\tFalls into one of ten NAICS codes [32211, 31411, 32511, 325181, 325188, 325192, 325199, 325211, 325311, and 32532]; or subject to the OSHA process safety management standard [40 CFR 68.10 (d) (2)].\n\nProgram 2 processes are those that do not meet Program 1 or 3 criteria.\n2.0\t\tStationary Source ARP Program Status Determination\n\t2.1.\tBackground\nEnergy Transfer Gulf Coast Operations is the owner/operator of the Stationary Source, LPG Storage Facility, located at a latitude 31\u00b0 22' 23.92\" N and longitude 89\u00b0 16' 2.47\" W in Forrest County, Texas. \n\nThe Hattiesburg LPG Storage Facility is designed to store butane during off-peak months.

All equipment and vessels are connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of multiple processes. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\nThere are no regulated toxic substances at this Stationary Source more than RMP threshold quantities.\nThis Stationary Source does store regulated flammable substances in vessels that exceed threshold quantity; therefore, the Stationary Source is a covered process with regulated substances subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis (see Table 1).

If Stationary Source employees take part in responding to accidental releases, then the Stationary Source is required to periodically review and update, as appropriate, the Stationary Source\u0092s emergency response program and notify employees of any changes to the emergency response plan (40 CFR 68.95). Updates should include the date of the most recent review of the emergency response program and most recent training.

These substances, their location, potential hazards, accident prevention measures, and consequence minimization measures are included in Appendix 1.

For substances in vessels, you must assume release of the largest amount in a single vessel; for substances in pipes, you must assume release of the largest amount in a pipe. The largest quantity should be determined considering administrative controls. Administrative controls are written procedures that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel or pipe at any one time, or, alternatively, occasionally allow a vessel or pipe to store larger than usual quantities (e.g., during turnaround). You do not need to consider the possible causes of the worst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur; the release is simply assumed to take place. \nRelease Height.\n All releases are assumed to take place at ground level for the worst-case analysis. This is a conservative assumption in most cases. Even if you think a ground-level release is unlikely at your site, you must use this assumption for the worst-case analysis. \nWind Speed and Atmospheric Stability. \nMeteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in the rule as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). If, however, you can demonstrate that the minimum wind spe"

To demonstrate higher minimum wind speeds or less stable atmospheric conditions, you will need to document local meteorological data from Chapter 4, 4-7 Offsite Consequence Analysis the previous three years that are applicable to your site. If you do not keep weather data for your site (most sources do not), you may call another nearby source, such as an airport, or a compiler, such as the National Weather Service, to determine wind speeds for your area. \n\nExhibit 3-1 in Chapter 3 describes atmospheric stability classes in relation to wind speed and cloud cover. Your airport or other source will be able to give you information on cloud cover. A small difference in wind speed probably will not lead to a significant decrease in the distance to the endpoint.\n\nAPPENDIX A\nGENERAL DUTY CLAUSE\nThe Accident Release Prevention/Risk Management Program (ARP/RMP) regulation includes a statement that all sites must comply with the general duty clause of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r) (1) [see attached]. The general duty clause provides that owners and operators have a general duty to identify hazards that may result from accidental releases, design, and maintain a safe Stationary Source, and minimize the consequences of any releases that occur. The general duty clause affects all substances considered to be hazardous, not just those flammable and toxic materials listed in the ARP/RMP regulation. Therefore, Kinder Morgan LP has developed a General Duty Form to assure compliance with the general duty clause of the CAA as referenced in the ARP/RMP regulation.\n\nPrevention of Accidental Release\nBackground\nThe Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Provisions are contained in 40 CFR Part 68.
