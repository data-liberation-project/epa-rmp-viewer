Compressor discharge lines are not insulted to facilitate the cooling process before arrival at the condensers.  \n\nLiquid ammonia is circulated via insulated pipelines to evaporator coils throughout the facility.  Ammonia is vaporized in the evaporators and returned to the compressors.  Low pressure ammonia vapor is first returned to the low stage compressors, then pulled through the intercoolers by the high stage compressors, which then discharges to the condensers.  The high pressure vapor is then condensed to high pressure liquid ammonia by dispelling latent heat to the atmosphere.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation. \n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 17351 pounds. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nBuilding Codes:\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies at the time of design/construction.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment review of the accident history, (2018-2023), there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe NSP facility has a Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations. This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases. NSP's policy is to contact 9-1-1 in the event of an ammonia release.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well"

The facility maintains a PSM Team whose members are involved in reviewing the PSM  Program.  National Steak Processors, LLC has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe National Steak Processors, LLC facility is located at 301 East Fifth Avenue in Owasso, Oklahoma.  This facility provides refrigeration and freezing for food products.  The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration and freezing for product.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. \n\nThe ammonia is circulated throughout"
