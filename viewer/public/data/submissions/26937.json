The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the intercooler in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 18,454 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 1,845.4 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are:  the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the intercooler is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 1.56 miles (2.52 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\r\n\r\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 68.5 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 68.5 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 48.6 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of Carneco Foods, LLC operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rat"

Carneco Foods, LLC, Columbus, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Carneco Foods, LLC employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Carneco Foods, LLC owned activities at this facility.\r\n\r\nCarneco Foods, LLC management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nCarneco Foods, LLC produces ground beef and other related processed meat products at this location.  Support operations include cold storage warehousing, truck docks for shipping and receiving and administrative offices.\r\n\r\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint"

The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B \u00a768.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \u00bfUrban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat und unobstructed.\u00bf\r\n\r\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Columbus, Nebraska facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\r\n\r\nThe Columbus, Nebraska facility has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems:  the Frigoscandia and Storage ammonia refrigeration systems.  The larger ammonia system is in the Frigoscandia refrigeration system.  The worst-case release area for the Frigoscandia ammonia system would contain the area impacted by the worst-case release for the Storage ammonia system.  Therefore, one worst-case toxic release was specified for the entire facility.\r\n\r\nAmmonia\r\n\r\nThe data provided in the document \u00bfModel Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration\u00bf (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\u00bf (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressuriz"
