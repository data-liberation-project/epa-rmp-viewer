The program should include development of written procedures, training of maintenance personnel, inspection and testing of equipment, process for equipment repair and a method for assuring quality of process repair and construction.\n\nThe facilities Mechanical Integrity Program addresses the integrity of process equipment and instrumentation for safe and reliable operations.  The facility maintenance program covers three types of maintenance:  1) preventative and predictive maintenance, 2) routine maintenance (repair or corrective maintenance), and 3) turnarounds.  Preventative maintenance is performance of equipment inspection and repair based on time and historical knowledge of the equipment.  Predictive maintenance involves utilizing technological methods of inspection to determine equipment condition.  Preventative and predictive maintenance used in combination determine the inspection and repair frequency of equipment at the facility.  Routine maintenance is the repair or corrective maintenance of equipment as dictated by predictive maintenance, preventative maintenance and equipment condition.

Safeguards protecting against excessive pressure include high pressure alarms, pressure safety valves, thermal relief valves, piping/flange/equipment pressure ratings, water separation facilities and safety valves.  Safeguards protecting against excessive temperature include high temperature alarms, manual shutdowns and automatic shutdowns.  Safeguards protecting against low temperature include insulation and heating.  Excessive flow is protected against by high flow alarms, fail to safe position control valves, and pressure safety valves.  Safeguards against low flow or no flow include low flow alarms, recycle streams, shutdown systems and check valves.  High and low levels are protected against by high and low level alarms and shutdown systems.  Safeguards against contamination include use of analyzers, check valves and standardized utility connections.  Prevention safeguards against explosions include furnace instrumentation.  Loss of containment is protected against by isolation valves, proper material selection for corrosion and temperature, avoidance of dead legs, periodic inspection, proper water draw and sampling facility design, locked valves, proper design of pipe bracing and vent locations, freeze protection, proper pipe rating, emergency block valves and excess flow valves.  Safeguards for instrument failure include periodic testing of critical safety devices, including pressure safety valves.

The Earthquake Evaluation Study considered ground shaking that could occur on any of the faults near the facility.  These include the San Andreas, Hayward, Rodgers Creek, Green Valley, Concord, Greenville, and the Calaveras faults.  Fault rupture within the facility units was not considered.  The performance criteria used in the current seismic studies include evaluating the processes for the following: maintaining structural integrity (will it stay standing?), maintaining position (will it move and affect something else?), and maintaining containment of the material (will it keep its contents inside?).  \n\nThe method used to perform these seismic studies was a seismic walkdown.  This is an evaluation method involving the physical inspection of the process by a qualified engineer.  It is primarily a visual review that considers the actual condition of each installation in a systematic manner.  This method is generally referred to as a walkdown review, because engineers performing the review systematically walk down each equipment item, building, or system to look for potential seismic vulnerabilities.  The walkdown review emphasizes the primary seismic load resisting elements and the potential areas of weakness due to design, construction, or modification practices as well as deterioration or damage.  A special emphasis is placed on details that may have been designed without consideration of seismic loads.  The walkdown review may also include a limited review of drawings.  This may be done to check adequacy of older reinforced concrete structures, to verify anchorage details, or to identify configurations that cannot be visually reviewed due to obstructions, fireproofing, insulation, etc.  \n\nThe facility has inspection and maintenance practices to maintain ongoing integrity of structural components.

Consultation has been defined as a two-way dialogue between the employer and the employees and their representatives, where the employer seeks advice, criticism and suggestions.  Management receives direct input from employees through the Joint Health and Safety Committee meetings and by soliciting employee suggestions at the monthly Management/Employee Safety meetings.  The Annual Employee Computer Based Training (CBT) module includes a section on the Risk Management Program Elements to raise employee awareness and encourage participation.  Employee feedback forms are available for providing feedback on Process Safety Information and other Risk Management elements.  The USW H&S Representative is involved in management system changes to program elements.\n\nSome examples of active employee participation are listed in this section; however, this is not a list of all of the activities that fall under Employee Participation.  Employees regularly participate in two types of Safety Audits; one focuses on facilities, equipment and work practices (the Planned General Inspection), the other focuses the permit to work program where the work permits and the actual work practice are evaluated  (the Permit Audit).

In addition, guidance from regulatory agencies provides the standard for the program elements.  Each program element is integrated into the overall organization of the facility.  Any changes to the program are communicated through a variety of methods.  Communication between the element stewards is encouraged and expected for changes that could impact other element areas.  Changes will also be communicated through the Management Chain to all parties affected.  In addition, if the program change is significant, the changes will be communicated to all personnel at the facility through any number of communication channels, such as email, bulletin board postings, hard copy distribution, safety meetings, etc.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has a number of safeguards that are used to protect personnel and property from the hazards of the Covered Processes.  These safeguards were either originally constructed in the unit or implemented as a recommendation from a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Compliance Audit, and/or Incident Investigation.  Safeguards are examined during a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) by the PHA team for their adequacy in detecting, preventing and/or mitigating any potential hazards of the process.  If a PHA team determines that the safeguards do not adequately protect against a particular hazard, they recommend additional safeguards to the process.\n\nAs part of the PHA study, potential hazards and their safeguards are examined in a rigorous, methodical fashion for a variety of scenarios"

A Program Level 3 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance and the WCS reaches an offsite receptor.  A Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is a hypothetical event and the parameters for calculating the WCS is defined in the regulations.  For calculation purposes, it is assumed that the entire contents of the regulated substance in the largest container is released.  Based on equipment inventories and parameters given by EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance, a distance can be calculated for the WCS.  The Toxic and Flammable WCS and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) are documented in the Hazard Assessment.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention\n\nManagement Systems\n\nThe facility has implemented a management system for developing and continually improving the risk management program elements.  The responsibilities for the management of the various risk management program elements was previously discussed.  The RMP compliance program is incorporated as part of the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance program.  PSM is a Cal-OSHA regulation addressing process safety at industrial facilities.  RMP and PSM regulations are similar in their requirements.  PSM was enacted earlier than RMP, PSM directed that compliance development began in 1992, with completion in 1996.  However, RMP directed that compliance development begin in 1996 with completion in 1999.  Development of the RMP compliance program was the incorporation of any additional RMP requirements into the already existing PSM compliance program.  \n\nEach program element implementation is discussed in detail under the specific element sections (see Program 3 Prevention Elements).  Each element section also discusses the record retention requirements of that element.  While the Leadership Team has ov"

The Business Plan is updated annually in March and is submitted to Contra Costa Health Services.\n\nMost of the substances handled at the facility regulated by Contra Costa County\u2019s Ordinance 98-48 are flammables.  These materials range in flammability. For reference, a flash point is defined as the lowest temperature at which a liquid will give off sufficient vapor to ignite on application of a flame.  Large flash points indicate less flammability.  Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions involving these compounds.  For comparison, gasoline has a flash point of -45\uf0b0 F and diesel fuel has a flash point of 125\uf0b0 F.  Propane and Butane are flammable gasses with flash points much lower than gasoline. \n\nAs part of converting raw feed to motor fuels, several acutely hazardous materials are generated.  The two materials discussed here are hazardous principally through inhalation.  Hydrogen Sulfide, with its characteristic rotten egg odor, is created in the processing units that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the processing streams.  Hydrogen Sulfide is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas; its odor can be readily detected at concentrations below concern.  Hydrogen Sulfide is not stored at the facility.  Ammonia is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas with a sharp irritating odor.  Its odor is also readily detectable at concentrations below concern.  \n\nSome materials handled at the facility are corrosive in nature; their principal hazard is contact with skin.  Skin contact with these chemicals causes chemical burns.  Materials falling into this category include the chemicals used in the water and wastewater treatment areas.  \n\nCovered Processes:\n\nThis Risk Management Plan covered processes include those detailed in Prevention Program PL3 of the submittal.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Facility has Program Level 3 Covered Processes as defined"

The 5 Gas Plant purifies these compounds and separates them into their respective streams of propane, fuel gas, and naphtha. These streams can be reused in the facility furnaces or sold as product.\n\nThe cogeneration facility produces electricity and high pressure steam at high temperature, which is used for both heating and cooling various processes and to drive pumps and compressors. Additional heat and steam are provided by the Hot Oil System. In the Hot Oil Unit, a heat transfer fluid (Therminol VP-1) is heated in the Coker Furnace and transferred to supply heat to three units in series. These units include: 2 HCR, 5 Gas Plant, and the PTU. \n\nThe 2 WWTP separates oil and suspended solid particles, and biological treats the PTU wastewater through a Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) unit and a Moving Bed Bioform Reactor (MBBR).  The removal of oil and solids and biological treatment prior to further processing at the downstream Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) helps prevent overloading the WWTP biological treatment system. The API Separator and the WWTP plant are part of the facility\u2019s wastewater treatment system. The Foul Water Stripper is also part of the wastewater treating system and removes hydrogen sulfide and ammonia from foul water streams. Off gas will go through two absorbing units to remove hydrogen sulfide from the gas before being burned in the thermal oxidizer. Some of the foul water is reused as wash water in the HDO units.\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances:\n\nFor the purpose of this document, only selected substances will be discussed.

A feedstock pretreatment unit removes phosphorus, metals, and inorganic chlorides in the feedstock. Some pretreated material will also be utilized as feedstock in the facility. The feedstock must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons, must be removed of contaminants, and must be flowable in order for it to be useable as renewable fuels.\n\nUntreated feedstock begins its journey through the facility  at the Pretreatment Unit. Expected feedstocks include rendered fats (ie. packer\u2019s tallow, poultry fat), soybean oil, distillers corn oil, choice white grease, and non-neutralized brown grease. The feedstock needs to be pretreated prior to the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) unit to remove metal salts, phosphorous, and chlorides to protect downstream catalyst and metallurgy. The Pretreatment Unit combines feed with water and citric acid and heat before being sent to a reactor followed by desalters to facilitate oil and water separation. The wastewater is sent to 2 WWTP  and the pretreated renewable feed can be routed to 3 HDO, 1 HDO, and/or 2 HDO. \n\nPretreated feedstock will be used at the facility as well and will be fed directly to the HDO units. The HDO Units (3 HDO, 1 HDO, and 2 HDO) aim to remove oxygen and saturate olefins. The reaction takes place in the presence of hydrogen gas. The HDO intermediate product then goes to the 2 HCR unit which processes the material through a renewable ISOM/Dewaxing Reactor. The paraffins are isomerized to improve the cold flow properties and control the cloud point of the diesel (this process improves flowability of the product). The reaction also takes place in the presence of hydrogen. The 1 H2 Unit and 2 H2 Un"
