      "SummaryText": "Excelda Distributing is committed to providing a safe workplace for its employees and the public.  The facility is located in a rural area of Columbia, TN and the facility's function is storage and distribution of finished automotive service parts.  Excelda has provided a site plan of the building and copies of all material safety data sheets to the local fire department and we also have them available on site for review.  In March 1999, we provided the Emergency Planning and Community Right to know Act (EPCRA) report to the local fire department, the Maury county LEPC, and the TN SERC.\n\nThe facility is set up with a racking system containing pallet quantities of finished goods for distribution.  The employees ship product daily from this facility by truck load and common carrier to retailers throughout the states.  We store numerous products on site and the products requiring this report are consumer-sized aerosol products.  This report contains the maximum amount of aerosols we would ever have on site at one time and because of shelf life and inventory purposes we are not at this amount.  15000 pounds of these 6 products are the most we expect to have on site at one time.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on the release of our largest vessel, using the guidance supplied by the Chemical Distributors Reference Tables and equations.  The largest vessel is 23 ounces or 1.4 pounds.  If this release were to occur, 10% of the product weight is the regulated substance and the distance to the endpoint will be 21 feet (.004 miles) and this will stay within the walls of the warehouse. This building does not permit smoking inside nor does it have any processes that require a flame to be present.  Therefore, this release of one can is not likely to occur.  \n\nSince our process qualifies for program 1, I could not enter an alternative release scenario in the computer program but I can provide that here.  If this facility was burning, all products will be affected, not "

      "SummaryText": "a single vessel alone.  The endpoint based on the maximum release of the regulated substance will be 553 feet (.10 miles). There are some industrial businesses located within this distance.  \n\nAccidental realease prevention programs on site inlcude the hazard communication right to know training and the EPCRA information along with other OSHA, DOT and EPA requirements.  \n\nExcelda Distributing has not had any accidents since the operations began in September of 1998.  Our emergency response program has been coordinated with the Maury County Emergency Planning Committee and personnel at the facility.  The facility is monitored by SCT Security Systems Alarm Company.  Excelda has also recently sponsored an \"open house\" for area businesses and authorities to visit our operations to become familiar with the facility and the employees.  \n\nExcelda Distributing will provide on-going training throughout the remainder of this year and years to come as business develops.  The training will include more emergency response, fire extinguisher, first aid, and other OSHA, EPA and DOT required trainings as required."
