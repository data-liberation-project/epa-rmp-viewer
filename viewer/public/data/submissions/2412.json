Betts Filter Plant is a water treatment and filtration facility.  We take water from Lake Harding in its natural state and treat it to make it potable.  We take pride in the quality of the water that we deliver to our customers as well as the low impact that our facility makes on our surrounding environment.\n\nThe process of water treatment, in simple terms, is the addition of a substance called a coagulant to change the electrical charge of the water so we can form a heavier substance that will envelope undesirable elements and fall to the bottom of a basin designed for settling.\n\nOne of the processes we use is a disinfection process.  Water-borne diseases, bacteria, viruses, and cysts can live and grow in water so we disinfect to kill these undesirables.  The disinfectant we use is chlorine.  Chlorine will kill almost any living creature and is a very effective disinfectant because of that.  \nBecause chlorine can be so deadly, we take great care in how we handle and store chlorine.  Chlorine is shipped to us on flat-bed trucks.  The trucks carry cylinders that hold 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine.  Each container has been thoroughly inspected and certified by the chemical manufacturer before it was filled with chlorine. We normally would have no more than four full cylinders on hand at any one time.\nThe chlorine takes the form of gas in the upper parts of the cylinders and that is what we use to mix with water to create a chlorine disinfecting dose to add to the water.\nWe store the cylinders in a room that was specially designed to house the cylinders.  Every precaution has been taken to insure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nChlorine gas can be deadly. Chlorine is heavier than air and therefore will seek the lowest levels of terrain. "

The amount of chlorine discharged would not exceed a 15 second release of 5/8\" tubing.  \n\nThis release scenario has no offsite impact.

This release would normally last for approximately one hour with 317 lbs. of chlorine gas escaping at a rate of 10.5 lbs/min.

As the operator loosens the valve, he does it slowly so that he can retighten it quickly if there is gas present.  \nThe valve facings are cleaned before being attached to another cylinder and a lead gasket is placed between the supply valve and the cylinder valve.  \nThe cylinder valve is opened slightly and reclosed.  Ammonia gas is used to check for leaks.  If no leak is present, each valve is opened and closed in succession, being checked with ammonia gas for leaks.  I f there are no leaks, the cylinder is placed in service or in standby.\nThe operator then logs the date, time, personnel in attendance, cylinder number, and a description of any problems which occurred along with recommendations for parts replacement or necessary repairs.\n\nEach employee is also trained on the proper use of the \"Chlorine B Kit\".  We have a \"Self Contained Breathing Apparatus\" available at the entrance of the chlorine storage room.  The SCBA is tested and recharged annually.\n\nThe management team at the Water Works Board of the City of Opelika is committed to the safety of each of our employees and to the saf"

The amount of chlorine discharged would not exceed a 15 second release of 5/8\" tubing.  \n\nThe procedure is described in the exchange and replacement of chlorine cylinders.\n\nMODERATELY SEVERE DISCHARGE - A moderately severe discharge would be one in which a supply line or valve ruptured and chlorine gas was escaping at a rate of  approximately 10.5 lbs/min.\n\nThe operator would be alerted by the warning system that a possible chlorine leak might have occurred.
