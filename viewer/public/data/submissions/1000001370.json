The Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Mont Eagle Mills, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 104000  pounds in the facility's large storage tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are 12,000 gallons.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 231300  pounds, which represents the volume of the large storage tanks and all nurse tanks at 85 percent capicity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.06 miles.\n4.  The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 27,000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .78 miles.\n5.  The Five-year Accident History:  there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site;  nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The "
