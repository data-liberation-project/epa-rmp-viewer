Accidental release prevention and emergency response policy:\n      In this distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia which is considered toxic by the EPA.\nAnhydrous ammonia is a nitrogen fertilizer used to produce corn and other crops each year.  We\nare committed to safety.  Our employees receive training a minimum of six (6) times annually.  It is \nour policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  This company has been established  for over seventy five (75) years and has never had an incident involving an anhydrous ammonia release that has threatened the community members.\n\n2.    Our facility and the regulated substance handled:\n       We are an agriculture service company.  We handle fertilizer products and process dry beans.  We handle anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  We have equipment to receive, store and deliver anhydrous ammonia.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized personel only.\n\n3.    Worst case release scenario and alternate release scenario:\n       Worst case release scenario; complete failure of the 18,000 gallon storage tank would release 90,000 pounds of ammonia.  The distance to an end point would be 3.4 miles.\n       Alternate release scenario;  transfer hose failure resulting from a pull-away of a nurse tank causing the one-inch diameter transfer hose to break.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow but the contents of the hose is released.  The distance to an end point is less than one-tenth (.10) mile.  We used RMP comp to assist in developing the above scenario.\n\n4.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention program:\n       This facility complies with all federal and state codes and regulations.  All of our employees receive thorough training using industry standards.\n\n5.    Five-year accident history:\n      We have had no accidental release of anhydous"

Emergency response program:\n       All employees are trained in emergency response, utilizing classroom training and written testing, as well as on the job training.  We work with the LEPC and Fire Department.  We also use an independent company to provide safety training and to increase our awarness to potential hazards.\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety:\n       We inspect and perform maintenance to all equipment on a continuous basis.  Employee training programs are expanding."
