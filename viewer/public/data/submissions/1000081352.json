The facility has a trained emergency response team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.  The Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, Perdue's training program includes annual refreshers.  Also, the plant conducts a mock evacuation yearly with periodic drills coordinated with local emergency responders (Cromwell and Beaver Dam Fire Departments).  Perdue has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to address other emergency response related incidents such as bomb threats, spills or releases of hazardous materials, evacuation, and tornadoes or dangerous weather conditions.\r\n\r\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPerdue has installed an ammonia gas detection system and exhaust fans in the mechanical room and remote recirculation room.  In order to minimize the exposure of facility personnel in the event of a release, exhaust fans are activated if the ammonia concentration is detected inside the rooms at a pre-set concentration.  Also, the facility conducts a periodic vibration analysis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system.  In addition, as part of Perdue's continuous improv"

The programs involve a wide-range of senior management personnel (including Environmental Services Manager and Safety Supervisor).  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and training involving many levels of personnel.  Perdue's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans.  Perdue's corporate policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\r\n\r\n* Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n1. Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\r\nAmmonia is used for refrigeration purposes.  The processing facility operates a three-temperature, single-stage, anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system along with a remote recirculation room that maintains a multi-temperature, single-stage system.  The entire refrigeration system is a closed loop liquid re-circulation system with a total system storage capacity of 45,700 pounds.  The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the processing mechanical room, with the exception of the condensers located on the roof and piping located throughout the facility.\r\n\r\n2. Chlorine has been removed from the RMP as the quantity stored onsite has been reduced to well below the 2500lbs. threshold.\r\n\r\n* General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nPerdue maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. The plan is prepared in accordance with OSHA"
