The distance to the endpoint would be 4.4 miles\n   b The alternative release scenario would be the break of a transfer hose The distanse to the endpoint would be .3 miles\n4  Accidental Release Prevenetion Program: This facility has implemented the previsions of OSHA Standard 29 cfr 1919.1200, Hazard Communication.\n5  Five-year Accident History: Ther have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years\n6  Emergency REsponse Program: The \"Emergency Actoin Plan\" of Riverside Fertilizer describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment from sudden releases and non-sudden releasea of anhydrous ammonia Copies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
