This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n Enterprise Products Almeda Terminal located in Harris County, Texas is owned by Enterprise GC, LP. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.  The facility is a salt dome storage facility, consisting of solution-mined caverns whereby the following products are stored:\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Butane\r\n\u00bf\tP/P Mix\r\n\u00bf\tRGB mix\r\n\u00bf\tButane Butylenes mix\r\n\r\nThere is also 1 disposal wells at the Almeda Terminal whereby brine is disposed of..\r\n\r\nA salt dome storage cavern is a cavity formed in a salt dome by controlled dissolving of the salt.  The resulting cavity is relatively long and slender but the storage capacity is usually very large.  \r\n\r\nEnterprise Products Almeda Terminal is equipped with the following supporting systems, equipment, and supplies:\r\n\u00bf\tConnections to outside transportation facilities.\r\n\u00bf\tInstrumentation to monitor and control the various components of the storage facility.\r\n\u00bf\tMetering systems.\r\n\u00bf\tPumps for product injection.\r\n\u00bf\tBrine supply and surface storage (brine pit).\r\n\u00bf\tBrine pumps to inject brine into the wells for product removal.\r\n\u00bf\tA source of fresh water and pumps to deliver it for well washing and brine makeup.\r\n\u00bf\tProduct/brine se"

From the pump, flow is routed to the appropriate well where it passes through the wellhead and into the cavern.  An equivalent volume of brine is displaced out of the well via the wellhead to the brine pit.\r\n\r\nIn the event that brine leaving the storage well may have entrained a small amount of product or salt gas, the brine stream from the well is routed through a separator which removes any entrained LPG product.  That small amount of product or salt gas is routed to the flare for disposal and the brine is routed to the brine pit where it is held for future use.  Under normal operation, LPG is not entrained in the brine stream, but under unusual conditions, such as when the interface reaches a weep hole, such entrainment can occur.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProduct Removal - Product is removed from storage well by routing brine into the well.  Brine pumps located at the brine pit supply the necessary brine flow to the storage well.  Pressure due to the weight"

The brine pumps are not usually required to actually produce pressure in the well.  They simply move brine to the well and gravity, acting through the brine/product weight differential, produces the required pressure.\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tMetering, Monitoring, and Control - All products flowing into and out of storage wells is metered to determine well inventory and monitor the volume being moved.  Temperatures, pressures, and flows of all streams are monitored and recorded in the control room.  Each wellhead trip system is designed such that each cavity is individually protected against under pressure, overpressure, and overfilling.  Operation control of the product and brine pipeline streams is maintained from the control room as well.\r\n\r\n \r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.
