West Virginia Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the Contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee and the community.\r\nThe DOW Operations at the Technology Park are included in the site wide Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post- incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition to the on-site emergency squad, DOW Chemical has Distribution Emergency Response Teams throughout the United States that are available to distribution emergency within our area. \r\n\r\nKanawha/Putnam EPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA number of process safety improvements have been made to the Polyolefins Process R&D Pilot Plant to improv"

Additionally the Ethylene storage and distribution systems were upgraded with safer piping configurations and installation of additional ESD valve. The Ethylene storage facility was also upgraded with a new vaporization system. The largest improvement to the Bulk Storage Area was the termination of Ethane usage at the Tech Park. This allowed removal of all Ethane associated storage facilities."

The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nWVO is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, primary incident response is via municipal agencies activated by 911.  Incidents involving Union Carbide facilities are also responded to by the Union Carbide incident commander. We are also an active member of the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Technology Park is a State-owned 651-acre industrial park complex, of which UCC maintains ownership of approximately 60 acres.  This industrial park houses the Union Carbide Polyolefins Research & Development (PRD) pilot plant, as well as other non-Union Carbide small-scale manufacturing, professional office space, academia, and specialized lab space for incubator and start-up companies.\r\n\r\nUnion Carbide's PRD plant currently has 4 RMP regulated substances present in 1 covered pilot plant process at the Technology Park. Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following EPA RMP-regulated flammable substances at the PRD plant:\r\nPropylene\r\nEthylene\r\nIsopentane\r\n1-Butene\r\n\r\nChanges to flammable worst-case and flammable alternative-case scenarios have been"

Key elements include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled effectively. The methodology used to carry out these analyses include:\r\nChecklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Audits, Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses.
