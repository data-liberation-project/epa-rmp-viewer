EPAs RMP*COMP offsite consequence analysis software was used to estimate distances for offsite impacts.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of chlorine transport containers (they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at chlorine suppliers and the Blendville Plant.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in The alternative release scenario(s) section below.\n\nA credible worst-case scenario was selected as the alternative release scenario. This scenario assumes that the unloading yoke/flexible connection to a 1-ton transport container is completely severed when performing leak testing and the resulting vapor release occurs within the building.  The mitigating affects of the building were not considered.  This means that the modeled chemical release rate from the building is higher than the EPA guidance would predict.  \n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \nThe potential distance to the endpoint concentration for this alternate release scenario extends offsite into residential and commercial areas.

The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.

      "SummaryText": "The Missouri-American Water Company Blendville Plant is a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to customers in the area of Joplin, MO. To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.\nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in shipping containers. Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.  \n\nMissouri-American Water Company is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\n\nMissouri-American Water Company has completed an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case release scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or container as a gas in ten-minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance. \n\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the endpoint concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.
