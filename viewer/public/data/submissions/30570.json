The Facility Policy\n\nThe management and employees of Two Rivers Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. It an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for crop production.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 144,177 pounds in our 33000-gallon storage tank when filled to 85%. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of semi trailer holding 10,000 gallons.\n\nThe normal number of nurse tanks on site would be 15 @ 1,000 gallons each.  This would allow for a total of 65,535# at 85%.  \n\n3. The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nThe worst case and Alternate case scenarios have been removed at the request of the EPA as directed by the Homeland Security Act.  All critical information shall be passed on to the local first responders.  \n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, k-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  Note:  The Kansas Department of Agriculture has not adopted the most recent version of the ANSI standard.  When the more recent version is adopted we will allocate all necessary funds and manpower to insure that the new standards are met.\n\nWe also consider our training program to be a part of the Accidental Release Prevention program.  Good work pra"

The Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program. \n\n-the facility has:\nA. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard.  By definition we have chosen to have our employees evacuate and notify the first-responders, therefore we do not have an Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nB. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under Sara Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for the implementation at this time."
