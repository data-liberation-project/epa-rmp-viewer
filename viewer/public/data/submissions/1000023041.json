The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Brandt Consolidated, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Franklin Fire Department, Morgan Co. ESDA or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 470,800in our fixed storage tanks and nurse tanks stored at the facility.  The largest single tank is 12,000 gallons (56,000lbs).\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nWorse-Case:  Information not disclosed\n\nAlternative Case: Information not disclosed\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydours Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards, Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia (from our fixed sources) in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damages. \n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan ( in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place and has coordi"

We train our staff on the elements found in our response program (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120) and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
