The management and employees of the Lovington facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride is received and stored in a rail tank car that contains 149,000 pounds of refrigerated anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT containers such as tube trailers and cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, would be the rupture of the 149,000 lb rail car. The results would be a maximum release of 149,000 lbs of refrigerated anhydorous hydrogen chloride over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 0.03mg/L (EPRG-2 Level) was determined to be 20.0 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and rural topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 20,678 residents and several special receptors which includes two hospitals (North Lea General & Colombia Lea) and several schools based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".  Many business and industries are also within the endpoint. No environmental receptors are affected.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was determined involved the fill line rupture between the rail car and tube trailer. This release could result in the 45 min. release of 80 "

The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and rural topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would affect 5 residents and one business (Navjo Refinery) based on 1990 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\" and actual observations. No environmental receptors were affect by this scenario.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, Excess Flow Valves and Emergency Shut-off Valves,  a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and scrubber systems.\n\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen chloride.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen chloride system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen chloride.

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in November 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHAs hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.

In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in March 1999.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted in May  1999.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle hydrogen chloride has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.

BOC's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in April 1999 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.
