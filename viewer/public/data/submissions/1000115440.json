Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) \u0096 Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP/PSM Program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \u0093living document\u0094. As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Wonderful Citrus TX1 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP/PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Wonderful Citrus TX1, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Wonderful Citrus TX1 has updated their unified RMP/PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                                         |   Process Chemical                   | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nP1 Degreening System                             Anhydrous Ammonia              11,000\nP2 DC Cold Storage System                   Anhydrous Ammonia               11,000\n\nOur RMP/PSM Program promotes overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet RMP obligations as well\n2. Orga"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP/PSM Program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\nFacility Overview\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1 operates a commercial cold storage for citrus in Mission, TX. The facility has two (2) ammonia refrigeration systems that provide refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\nP1 Degreening System\n(8) Degreening Rooms\n\nP2 DC Cold Storage System\n(1) Cold Storage 1\n(1) Cold Storage 2\n(1) Cold Storage 3\n(1) Cold Storage 4/Lime Room 2\n(1) Cold Storage 5/Shipping Dock\n(1) Glycol Heat Exchanger\n\nFacility Location\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1 is located at 4012 E Goodwin Road, Mission, TX 78574. The latitude and longitude of the facility is 26.262057, -98.378222. The facility is located approximately 2 miles north of Interstate 2 in a residential area surrounded partially by agriculture land.\n\nA review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Wonderful Citrus TX1 has less than a 1% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\nDescription of Covered Processes\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery rooms.\n\nProcess Classification\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Wonderful Citrus TX1 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. The systems are neither interconnected nor co-located relative to each other. As such, the refrigeration systems at Wonderful Citrus TX1 are tr"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Wonderful Citrus TX1 facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1 has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans \u0096 Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements] \u0096"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1 has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker, public, and environmental safety. Nevertheless, Wonderful Citrus TX1 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP/PSM Program. This has improved Wonderful Citrus TX1\u0092s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP/PSM related events so that Wonderful Citrus TX1\u0092s management team can ensure that the RMP/PSM Program is being implemented.\n\nWonderful Citrus TX1 has implemented all aspects of the RMP/PSM Program. When a RMP/PSM Program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wonderful Citrus TX1 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain he"
