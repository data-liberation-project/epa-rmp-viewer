      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water. The LADWP Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009. This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP. The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPS in 1999 and 2004 because Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009.  Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and the CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Eagle Rock Chlorination Station has a good record in preventing accidents from occurring. \n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is located at 5403 Hillmont Avenue in Eagle Rock, next to the Ventura Freeway.  This facility serves to chlorinate the reservoir, one inlet line, and two discharge lines.  The water serves the northern and eastern Los Angeles area. The station consists of a chlorine container and"

The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and the CalARP Program rules. A maximum of seven one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination station.  Six of these chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and one is stored as a spare. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\n\n\nIn normal operations, six chlorine one-ton containers are manifolded together in two banks of three containers to supply chlorine.  These six containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  The primary bank is connected to the liquid header and the secondary bank is connected to the gas header.  The liquid chlorine passes from the containers to the evaporator where it is vaporized in a water bath.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to one of the four chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine. The gas supplying containers bypass the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry or the evaporator shuts down due to a low temperature condition.

The liquid header line is equipped with pressure gauges and an expansion chamber to protect against excessive pressure.  The primary (liquid) bank provides all the chlorine to the station through the evaporators until it is depleted.  The gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.  Once the primary bank is depleted, the higher vacuum level acts on the diaphragm of the automatic switchover vacuum regulator in the secondary bank, thereby pulling that valve open to start feeding gas.\n\n\n\nThe gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or from the chlorine gas header proceeds to the chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators and then to the injectors. It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve. \n\n\n\nThe gaseous chlorine is pulled by vacuum from the chlorinators to injectors where it is dissolved into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.

The MS is an emergency chlorine scrubber intended to protect personnel working in the building or immediate area from a chlorine gas release from the pressure safety relief vent provided in the vacuum regulator check units. Mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine. The media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion. The mini-scrubber is activated automatically at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm.\n\n\n\nIn the event power is lost at the Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.

The 1993 hazard review/PHA was further reviewed in April 1999. In April 2004 a hazard review/PHA was again performed for the whole chlorination system.  The 2004 hazard review/PHA for the facility was further reviewed in March 2009. The 2009 PHA was again reviewed on March 14, 2014 and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there will be a major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed in March 2014 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of the recommended actions.\n\n\n\nA seismic walkthrough was completed on March 4, 2014 based on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Region 1 guidance document, and recommendations are being evaluated for implementation. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe LADWP has prepared written operating procedures for Eagle Rock Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to chlorination process.
