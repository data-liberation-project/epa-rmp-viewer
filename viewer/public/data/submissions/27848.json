By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, improve the quality of our products, achieve cost savings, and increase operational efficiencies.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Cargill does not manufacture ammonia but receives it via  pipe line and tanker truck.  Ammonia is used in the production of nitrogen-phosphorus bearing granular fertilizers.  Our onsite storage capacity is sufficient for only about 12 hours usage of ammonia.  Inventories are purposely kept low to reduce the risk of exposure should an accidental release occur.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  It is the personal challenge and policy of the management and associates of this facility to identify and reduce or eliminate all recognized process hazards, not only involving the regulated substance but of all hazardous substances and circumstances.\n\nTo achieve the goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n\n- A knowledgeable, highly trained and motivated employee group\n- A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n- Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n- Preparation and training for emergencies\n\nThe facility has had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect for many years and is periodically reviewed.  Employees are trained regularly in the event of an emergency.  The plan is desig"

A general plant alarm is in operation and also a system of immediate neighbor notification.  This plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to those responding agencies.  Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department.\n\n PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Green Bay facility is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management rule and is therefore under the EPA Risk Management Rule and is a Program 3 facility with a Program 3 Prevention Program.  The OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures which promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, and process hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantity specified.  The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, safe work practices, incident investigation, audits, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\nThe prevention program consists of many elements and policies, which are briefly outlined below.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - Employees are involved in all aspects of the program and are provided any information developed in the program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION - All necessary process information and records are maintained in several convenient locations including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS - Several employees have had extensive professional training in the methods of process hazard anal"

These reviews are updated on a regular basis.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - Operating procedures are in place for all aspects of operation including emergency operation and shutdown.\n\nOPERATIONS TRAINING - All operators are trained initially in the process and its operating procedures and are supervised by an experienced operator for a lengthy training period before being allowed to control the process on their own.  They must demonstrate competency in all aspects of the plant operation including unexpected malfunctions.\n\nCONTRACTORS - Contractor selection includes review of safety performance and programs.  All contractor employees are required to attend an initial 16 hour OSHA/MSHA structured class offered at several local community training facilities.  Contractors are also required to have had a recent site specific training and periodic evaluations are made to assure work is completed in a safe manner.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW - A safety review is conducted on any new process equipment or any significant modification of the process.  This assures that construction and equipment is installed in accordance with design, all necessary procedures including safety procedures are in place, training is completed, and that hazard analysis or requirements of management of change are completed.\n\nMACHANICAL INTEGRITY - This is a quality assurance procedure to assure that equipment, parts, materials, and installations are suitable for the applications intended.  Maintenance employees are trained in the process hazards and in safety procedures applicable to their work.  Inspections, procedures and testing are conducted under this part of the program.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES - Procedures and policies for work permits and maintenance lock-out-tag-out procedures.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE - No changes in process or procedures are allowed without review and authorization.  Safety impacts, technical review, required procedure modifications,"

Findings of the investigation and recommendations for corrective action are documented, as is the resolution of the recommendations and corrective actions.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT - Compliance with the program is audited at least every three years to verify compliance with these procedures.  Findings of the audit are documented and any deficiencies are corrected and documented.\n\n5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  This facility has had two reportable incidents that occurred on September 12, 2002 and December 18, 2002. As a result of these incidents, an investigation team was formed to thoroughly evaluate the causes.  The team recommended and the company?s engineering department instituted a variety of improvements and mitigation systems to prevent a future occurrence.  No off-site impacts resulted from either release. \n\nSYNOPSIS OF WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances.  The rule requires an analysis involving the release of the total contents of the largest storage vessel of ammonia at this site.  This is called the ?worst case toxic release scenario? (worst case scenario) and involves the release of 186 tons of ammonia.  This release must be considered to occur over a 10-minute period and all of the ammonia must be considered to convert to gas instantly.  We have retained a consultant to model this unlikely release utilizing "

      "SummaryText": "a model known as DEGADOSE.  His results, modeling according to the rule, determined that there would be only minor off-site impact.  This worst case is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nAn alternate scenario, which is a more likely event, is required to be submitted.  The alternate chosen involved the release of ammonia from a transfer pipe where 60,000 pounds would be released over a 15 minute period.  A significantly lower quantity is involved because various shutdown safeguards are present and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the quantity of failures.  The same modeling techniques were applied and resulted in even lesser off-site impact.\n\n\n PLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS:\n  \nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the Green Bay facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Many process safeguards have been implemented as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis and incident investigation activities.  Such things as remote shut-down systems, early detection sensors, surveillance monitors and water deluge systems have all been installed within the last two years in response.  It is the understanding of Cargill that through the diligent application of the elements of the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program that our employees and the community can be assured that emergency response will never be necessary."
