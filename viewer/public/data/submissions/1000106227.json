The New England Central Railroad has established practices and procedures to maintain the facility in safe operating conditions. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIf a release of a stationary propane tank car were to occur at White River Junction,  the New England Central Railroad would initiate the emergency response actions. The railroad would also conduct the incident investigation and the incident report development under an Unusual Occurrence Report. Crestwood would not be involved in the emergency response actions or incident investigation or development of the incident report. Crestwood would have access to the incident report once the investigation is completed by the railroad.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe New England Central Railroad, Inc. follows the Federal Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation regulations under 49 CFR Subtitle B Section II for the movement and storage of tank cars including the tank cars stored by Crestwood at White River Junction. If a release of propane from a stationary tank car does occur, response actions would be directed by The New England Central Railroad. Outside response activities, if deemed necessary,  would be coordinated with the Hartford Fire Department and  Vermont Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAccording to Crestwood personnel, the White River Junction Rail Siding has had no RMP accidents in the last five years.\n\nPlanned Changes t"

Crestwood systematically examined each hazard identified in the review to ensure that adequate controls were in place and the potential risk was appropriately mitigated.\n\nRecommendations from Hazard Reviews are prioritized on a relative risk ranking based on Crestwood's Corporate Risk Matrix. The ranking helps ensure that potential hazards assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to Hazard Reviews are prioritized and tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nCrestwood conducts no operations at the site. The New England Central Railroad maintains written procedures that address deliveries and shipments for railroad tank cars. The procedures used onsite are written to comply with the Federal Railroad Administration, Department of Transportation regulations under 49 CFR Subtitle B Section II. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes.\n\nTraining\n\nCrestwood conducts no operations at the site. The New England Central Railroad has implemented a comprehensive training program for all site employees. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Al"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nCrestwood has a land and track lease agreement with the New England Central Railroad, Inc. for the short-term storage of up to 60 propane railcars near White River Junction, VT.\n\nThe loaded interconnected railcars fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68 while disconnected from a means of transportation (i.e.locomotive). The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity: propane.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\nThe White River Junction Siding is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management Program 2 (RMP) regulation. \n\nSafety Information\n\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe storage of the regulated substance. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for safe storage of the propane and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained by operations. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). \n\nHazard Review\n\nCrestwood has conducted a Hazard Review of the Propane Rail Tank Car storage process to evaluate the hazards associated with the process. The review identified potential causes for accidental releases, safeguards needed to control hazards and pre"
