The facility is located on a 40-acre parcel in St. Louis, MO and is comprised of about 50 buildings containing manufacturing operations, research and development, utility services, and warehousing.\n\nThe EPA-regulated substances are chlorine and chloroform. Chlorine is utilized to manufacture the contract media agents.  Chlorine is staged and then delivered one cylinder at a time for usage in a reaction to manufacture the contrast media. Chloroform is stored in 55-gallon drums in the Building 76 warehouse and outside the B235 process area. Chloroform is used to manufacture DEC-Noroxymorphone in Building 235.  Chlorinated waste streams from the process are sent to a bulk waste tank in preparation for transport off site.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMallinckrodt Tyco/Healthcare handles thousands of pounds of chlorine and chloroform each year.  There have been no incidents which have involved deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on or off-site, and there are no instances of adverse impact to the employees, community, or the environment in the past five years.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nMallinckrodt Tyco/Healthcare has a robust emergency response program that includes administrative and operational response procedures, training, and drills.  The program meets the requirements of OSHA and EPA for protection of the safety of our employees and the community and provides for the protection of the environment.
