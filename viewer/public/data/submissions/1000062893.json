Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n\n\n3. Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program: This facility complies with state rules relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations administered by the state Fire Marshal are consistent with CGA G-2.1 (formerly ANSI K61.1) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History: There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or environmental damage on or offsite.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: This facility is classified as a non-responding facility. We have implemented an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 for employee safety. We have coordinated with the local LEPC and fire departement to be included in the community response plan.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvements are an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
