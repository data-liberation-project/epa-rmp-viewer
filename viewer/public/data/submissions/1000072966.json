This executive summary is structured from the requirements specified in 40 CFR 68.155.  The following paragraphs A through F intend to specifically address the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) in 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n\n\nA)     It is the policy of TRE to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion, fire, and/or a release of flammable liquids.  A secondary objective is to minimize potential impacts to TRE employees, the public, and the environment in the unlikely event of a release.  TRE plans to accomplish these objectives by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining an appropriate preventative program for the equipment, providing proper training to TRE employees, hiring reputable qualified contractors, and coordinating emergency response and planning activities with local emergency management services.\n\n\n\nB)    TRE is a fuel grade ethanol production facility.  This RMP submittal includes one process for the denaturant (a flammable liquid) storage and use at the TRE facility.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to render the produced ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The denaturant is a flammable liquid mixture containing regulated substances, pentane and butane.  The denaturant is received at the facility from tanker trucks and is stored in an atmospheric above ground storage tank prior to being used to render the produced alcohol unfit for human consumption.  The denatured ethanol is stored in one of two atmospheric above ground storage tanks prior to being shipped offsite.  \n\n\n\nC)    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios were conducted for denaturant storage and use process.  These release scenarios were conducted in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR Part 68 usi"

The key concepts used in the TRE accident prevention program are elements of TRE's Process Safety Management Program (PSM) required under 29 CFR 1910.119 (ethanol separation process).  TRE still uses the principles and elements of its PSM program to evaluate risk and prevent accidents from its non-PSM covered processes, such as the denaturant storage and use process.  \n\n\n\nD)    At the time of this filing, TRE has not had any accidents or releases.  \n\n\n\nE)    Emergency response at TRE is coordinated with TRE and Coshocton Fire Department so that in the event of an accident, immediate response measures can be implemented.  TRE's current policy is one of limited first response.  TRE will evacuate and secure the facility while waiting for local emergency management services to provide full response.  TRE maintains written emergency action plans. \n\n\n\nF)    TRE will continue to evaluate and implement changes as necessary to improve safety and minimize the risk of accidental releases at TRE.  \n\n"
