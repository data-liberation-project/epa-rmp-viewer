      "SummaryText": "thanol plant is located in about two miles west of Marcus, Cherokee County, Iowa.  LSCP is located in the North \u00bd of the NE \u00bc, Section 2, Township 92 North, Range 42 West, bounded on the North by 480th Street, east by F Ave., west by undeveloped land and south by a rail line.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant which is considered a flammable mixture.  Ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process.  Natural Gasoline is used to denature the ethanol so it is impure prior to being shipped off-site in accordance with applicable regulations.  Denaturant is generally stored on-site in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.  The maximum capacity of onsite denaturant storage is about 380,800 pounds.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored on-site in an above ground storage tank, which can hold approximately 97,200 pounds of ammonia.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has constructed an ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.  To date, LSCP has not had a spill of reportable quantities that has been released to land or water.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.
