No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria.  \n\nRichmond WorkA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B (68.20-68.42), as well as the USEPAA?s Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document and the RMP Comp v1.07 program.  The release prevention and emergency response programs at this site were developed based on requirements of the CAAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Provisions and the California Accidental Release Prevention Regulations. \n\n1.0    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGeneral Chemical recognizes that the responsible management of health, safety and the environment in and around its facilities is one of its highest corporate priorities and a key element in its successful business strategy. General Chemical is committed to implementing policies and procedures that ensure that its operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Achieving responsible health, safety and environmental management will be accomplished by: operating our facilities safely and prudently; efficiently using energy and materials; seeking ways to minimize or reuse wastes; and otherwise complying fully with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Richmond Works has prepared employees in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a rel"

Oleum is produced as an intermediate chemical in a state-of-the-art facility that was installed in 1997.  As one of the most advanced plants of its kind, it produces ultra-high-purity Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid having overall ionic contaminant levels of less than 400 parts per trillion.  Sulfuric Acid and Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid are used in many applications including pharmaceuticals, batteries, and plastics.  A major use of the acid produced at this facility is in the production of gasoline at a neighboring refinery.  The maximum quantity of oleum on-site is 72,000 pounds.\n\n3.0    Accidental Release Prevention Programs and ChemicalA?Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Richmond Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\nA?    Process Safety Information A? Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\nA?    Mechanical Integrity A? Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\nA?    Process Hazard Analysis A? Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\nA?    Standard Operating Procedures A? Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\nA?    Employee Participation A? Employees at all levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.  \n\nA?    Training A"

Process parameters are maintained through a management of change system which documents the changes as well as evaluates changes for safety.\n\nA?    Pre-startup Safety Review A? Significant changes to the processes are evaluated in detail in order to verify that the proper procedures for engineering, operations, emergency response and overall safety are addressed prior to start-up.\n\nA?    Incident Investigation A? All incidents are investigated to ensure proper modifications are made to reduce or eliminate the potential for re-occurrence.\n\nA?    Safe Works Practices A? Standard safety practices are in place to help insure worker safety including lockout/tagout procedures, control of entry into process areas, line breaking procedures, confined space entry procedures and hot work procedures.\n\nA?    Contractor Safety A? Contractors are evaluated and trained prior to performing work on-site to reduce the potential of an incident. \n\nA?    Compliance Audits A? Audits are performed at a minimum of three-year intervals to verify procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.\n\n4.0    Five Year Accident History\nThere has been one incident in the past 5 years involving oleum: on July 26, 2005 we had an oleum release from our CP Plant that resulted in the release of approximately 18 pounds of sulfur trioxide. There were no offsite consequences from this release.\n\n5.0    Emergency Response\nGeneral ChemicalA?s Richmond Works maintains an emergency response plan, which addresses all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the administering agency - Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Division.  In ad"
