No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria.  \n\nRichmond Work\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B (68.20-68.42), as well as the USEPA\u00c2\u00bfs Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document and the RMP Comp v1.07 program.  The release prevention and emergency response programs at this site were developed based on requirements of the CAA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Provisions and the California Accidental Release Prevention Regulations. \n\n1.0\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGeneral Chemical recognizes that the responsible management of health, safety and the environment in and around its facilities is one of its highest corporate priorities and a key element in its successful business strategy. General Chemical is committed to implementing policies and procedures that ensure that its operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Achieving responsible health, safety and environmental management will be accomplished by: operating our facilities safely and prudently; efficiently using energy and materials; seeking ways to minimize or reuse wastes; and otherwise complying fully with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, Richmond Works has prepared employees in conjunction with local emergency response groups, to respond to a rel"

Oleum is produced as an intermediate chemical in a state-of-the-art facility that was installed in 1997.  As one of the most advanced plants of its kind, it produces ultra-high-purity Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid having overall ionic contaminant levels of less than 400 parts per trillion.  Sulfuric Acid and Electronic Grade Sulfuric Acid are used in many applications including pharmaceuticals, batteries, and plastics.  A major use of the acid produced at this facility is in the production of gasoline at a neighboring refinery.  The maximum quantity of oleum on-site is 72,000 pounds.\n\n3.0\tAccidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical\u00c2\u00bfSpecific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Richmond Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information \u00c2\u00bf Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity \u00c2\u00bf Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis \u00c2\u00bf Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the operating conditions.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tStandard Operating Procedures \u00c2\u00bf Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmployee Participation \u00c2\u00bf Employees at all levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.  \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tTraining \u00c2"

There were no offsite consequences from this release.\n\n5.0\tEmergency Response\nGeneral Chemical\u00c2\u00bfs Richmond Works maintains an emergency response plan, which addresses all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
