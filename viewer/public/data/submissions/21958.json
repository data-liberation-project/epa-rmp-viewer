If anccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 79,000 pounds in an 18,000 gallon stoarge tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a stoarge tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity stored would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 84 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 PPM) is 1.89 miles. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .83 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61 and OHSA 29 CFR 1910.111. We have also complied with EPA, DOT, and the Kansas Department of Agriculture who inspects the facility on an annual basis. These standards and regulations along with the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safety record.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, propery damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and we report our regulated matertials to the Community Right to Know program, the local fire department and the County LEPC.
