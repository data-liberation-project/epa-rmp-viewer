Outrigger Energy owns and operates midstream assets throughout the Permian Basin in West Texas and the Powder River Basin in Northeast Wyoming.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP-regulated substances handled at this facility are flammable mixtures and propane. The flammable mixtures are extracted from the natural gas processed at the plant; while propane is used for refrigeration.  The process includes inlet gas compressors to raise the pressure through the plant, a process skid to extract natural gas liquids, residue compressors to raise the gas pressure from the plant to sales point, a natural gas liquid stabilizer to process any liquids formed in the compression process, and natural gas liquid pumps to push product from the plant to the natural gas liquid sales point.\r\nThis facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels were evaluated for offsite consequence analyses.  The single worst-case scenario (WCS) is associated with a release of a flammable mixture at the Loving Gas Plant.  The scenario is a vapor cloud explosion involving 25,000 pounds of a natural gas liquids (NGL) contained in the NGL surge vessel (V-405).  The entire inventory of this vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.2 mile radius. \r\n\r\nThe facility is located within a rural area; therefore, the WCS would not affect a public/off-site receptor and is considered a Program 1 process.  A consideration of the 0.2 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. Outrigger has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences.  Passive mitigation measur"

The prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Loving Gas Plant PSM/RMP program manual. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from covered processes at the Loving Gas Plant that resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage during this period. This meets the Program 1 five-year accident history requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.42.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Loving Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. Outrigger Energy has coordinated emergency response with the Ward County Fire Department.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.  The specific details of the action plans are documented in the PSM/RMP program manual.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety shall be actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues shall be held regularly at the plant. Employees will be encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to el"

Outrigger Energy takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. As for emergency response, The Company has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures will be reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\r\nOutrigger Energy understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Loving Gas Plant is located in Loving County, near Kermit, Texas.
