      "SummaryText": "1.  Facility Description and Regulated Substance\n\nMars Snackfood US, LLC (hereinafter \"the Company\"), operates a confectionary products manufacturing facility in Waco, Texas.  The facility utilizes aqueous ammonia (concentration 29.4%) as a nitrogen source for its wastewater pretreatment system.  The system utilizes more than a threshold quantity of ammonia, as specified in the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") regulations adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\").   \n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe Company is strongly committed to the safety of all persons that work in the Waco facility, as well as to the protection of the surrounding environment and community.  The Company has committed substantial resources to the engineering and design of the wastewater pretreatment system at the Waco facility to minimize the likelihood of accidental releases and to minimize the risk to the Company associates, the local community and the surrounding environment.  The Waco facility\u00c2\u00bfs comprehensive accidental release prevention program is reflective of the Company\u00c2\u00bfs strong commitment to safety.  In the event of an accidental release, associates at the facility are trained and equipped to provide an almost instantaneous response.  Moreover, they are trained to coordinate with the Waco-McLennan County Emergency Planning Committee, when necessary, to control and mitigate the effects of a release. \n\n3.  Prevention Program \n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local accident prevention regulations and codes, including the EPA RMP Rule.  The facility conducts regular documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Any equipment deficiencies identified through the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that responsible associates are competent in the operating procedures associated wi"

Five Year Accident History \n\nDuring the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of ammonia resulting in death, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or adverse environmental damage. \n\n5.  Emergency Response Program \n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan that addresses accidental releases of aqueous ammonia.  The plan is designed to minimize the potential for adverse effects of chemical exposure on human health through a combination of containment, control, evacuation procedures, and the use of personal protective equipment.  It further directs appropriate personnel to provide any required notifications to regulatory agencies and the public.  The facility has established and maintains a strong relationship with the Waco-McLennan County Emergency Planning Committee and the local Fire Department. \n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAssociates at the Waco facility are vigilant about identifying opportunities for improving facility operations.  Although no changes to the existing plans and procedures are contemplated at this time, the Company is committed to continual improvement in this area.  Regular, periodic reviews of safety and release prevention and preparedness measures will continue to occur."
