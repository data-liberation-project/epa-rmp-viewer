      "SummaryText": "        The purpose of this summery is to give a brief description of the Leavenworth Water Dept's. risk management program for a chlorine release. The Water Dept. has two plants. This RMP covers Plant #2 982 N.Highway 5 in Lansing Ks.66043. Plant #2 has 8000# of chlorine capacity at any given time. These are in 2000# cylinders with one cylinder on line to process and a backup cylinder ready for automatic switchover. Both online cylinders are housed in Chlortainers while connected and full or in process.Our worst case scenario would be a release of 2000# of chlorine from result of an unknown catastrophe. If this were the case we would activate our Emergency Response Plan with a call to the 911 dispatcher in turn notifying the Leavenworth Fire Dept. They would respond to the facility and contain the release and help with evacuation of residences, businesses and other public receptors within the end point of the release. Plant manager would notify Waste Express of Kansas City Missouri to respond to the plant to mitigate the release. However, our most likely release would consist of <2000# of chlorine. Again the Fire Dept. would be called and Waste Express would be called if need be to mitigate the release. The Leavenworth Water Dept. is working in an ongoing effort to train and review our safety and health programs at the plant. Within the last five years, we have not had a release of chlorine at the plant. The Water Dept. is always looking for new and better ways to handle chlorine. The safety of our operators and citizens is always on our minds."
