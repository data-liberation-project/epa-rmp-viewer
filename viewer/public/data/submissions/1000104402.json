Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Jackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration system.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have trained staff in emergency response and are coordinated with the Jackson Fire Department and the Jackson Madison County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility processing plant used for food manufacturing of frozen meals (Pizzas, Sandwiches, and Fish Sticks).  The only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia utilized as the primary cooling media in our four (4) closed-looped ammonia refrigeration systems.  Engine Rooms 1, 2, & 3 are physically connected.  In that all Engine Rooms (1 through 4) are managed by onsite personnel as one system (PSM Program), for the purposes of this RMP we are considering the four (4) systems as one process.  \n\nDue to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration onsite, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability (>10,000 lbs.), this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n \n3.

Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Management:\n\nThe Jackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are re-evaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, Jackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and pump out.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.  Annual certification of operating procedures are documented to indicate they are current and accurate.\n\nTraining:\n\nThe Jackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that authorized employees, wh"

Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nThe Jackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on the ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  At least once every five (5) years a mechanical integrity inspection/review is conduct for the complete refrigeration system. \n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Jackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility to manage changes in ammonia refrigeration system technology, equipment, and procedures.  Authorized employees whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia refrigeration system modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nJackson, Tennessee - Frozen Foods facility conducts PSM/RMP audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
