Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  MABS is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas including: design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and employee training associated with the regulated process at the facility.   \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:  The facility utilizes chlorine for disinfection during the water treatment process.  The facility uses chlorine stored in one (1) ton cylinders.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored on site is four (4) one ton cylinders.   The chlorine is stored in an enclosed room that is constructed of concrete block.  The chlorine injection system has been designed to incorporate numerous safety features to prevent, detect and respond to leaks. \n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:    The facility has an established accident release prevention program that complies with EPA\u00bfs RMP program. The Prevention Program consists of the following elements:\n\no Safety Information\no Hazard Review\no Operating Procedures\no Preventative Maintenance Program\no Contractor Evaluations\no Incident Investigation\no Employee Participation\no Training\no Compliance Audits\n\n4. Five-year accident history:  The facility has not had any reportable releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n5. The emergency response program:    The facility has a written emergency response plan to assist facility personnel in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  The emergency response program is based on both on-site and off-site emergency response.   The emergency response program includes all aspects of emergency"
