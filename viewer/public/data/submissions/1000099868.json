Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified refrigeration contractors carry out maintenance operations with previous training in NH3 refrigeration maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nValley Garlic Cold Storage will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are scheduled at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \r\n\r\nContractor Qualifications\r\nContractors and contract employees must be qualified and trained to work on and around the refrigeration system. This will insure that contractors with known safety issues are not allowed to work on or near the system. Those that have acceptable safety performance will train their employees on safety issues and procedures at our facility. This includes Hot Work which requires a permit and inspection before, during and after.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nValley Garlic Cold Storage promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

There have been no releases above 100 lbs/24 hours during this period.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Action Plan\r\nValley Garlic Cold Storage carries a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Valley Garlic employees will not enter an area that could result in a hazardous condition or exceeding the STEL for ammonia of 35 ppm average over 15 minutes. The plan includes all aspects of emergency actions including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nFresno County Environmental Health Services and local fire department are the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n \r\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nUsing written documentation of inspections, replacing Safety Relief Valves every 5 years, testing of the NH3 monitoring system, adding a safety shower and eye wash inside the mechanical room, and adding a hazardous materials spill kit in the mechanical room are some of the steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  All follow up items from the Compliance Audit and PHA revalidation will be completed in a timely period."

In this scenario the entire inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released in an enclosed space with direct contact with the outside air.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. RMP Comp and RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration Guidance was used to develop scenarios. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. The potential residential public receptors was based on the 2010 census data using Marplot and LV6 software. Only 10% of these could actually be impacted depending on the wind direction. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from a refrigeration compressor seal.  The scenario involves the release of 12 lb./min. for 30 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) can reach offsite. There are no residential receptors and no public receptors in the alternate release scenario.\r\n\r\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and California Accidental Release Prevention Program Title 19 Chapter 4.5.
