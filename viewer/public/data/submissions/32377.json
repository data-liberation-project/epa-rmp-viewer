      "SummaryText": "The Kirksville Water Treatment Plans is a 4.5 million gallon per day wate supply for the City of Kirksville, Missoouri. Our source water is drawn from one of two different surface empoundments. Hazel Creek Lake or Forest Lake in the Thousand Hills State Park. Our plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of our hazardous inhalant with dangerous health risk.\n\nTo lower potential injuries that may occur to the general public in and around the affected area of an accidental chlorine release, we have coordinated and trained with the Kirksville Fire Department on mock scenarios of emergency response. We also have coordinated with the local news media to provide city notification of a chlorine release.\n\nAn accidental chlorine release has potentially harmful site consequences to plants, animals, machinary, and humans. Therefore, we have installed some passive mitigation devices to impede any release. The first being a brick enclosure that houses all the chlorine stored at the treatment plant. This will contain the released chlorine until the emergency response unit is on the site of the release. The second device is a chlorine alarm detection system. This system's sensor is located in the chlorine enclosure, if there is a release an alarm would sound inside the water plant and alert the plant operator of a possible emergency. The third mitigation device are panic bars on the enclosure's doors. These allow, in case of a release, for the operator to escape the enclosure and begin the emergency response procedure.\n\nAll parts and pressures for our chlorine systems are recommended by the Chlorine Institue, ASTM (American Society of Testing Materials) and the manufacturers of particular chlorine systems.\n\nThe actual emergency response plan is posted at the Kirkville Water Plant, the Kirksville Fire Department, and the Public Works Complex.\n\nFor more information contact:    Kirkville Water Treatment Plant            660-665-3720\n                                       "
