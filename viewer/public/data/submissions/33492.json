The primary focus is to prevent accidental releases before they occur, while providing systems that minimize the size of any release that does occur and contain it in as small as area as possible.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  It is Valspar?s policy to operate its plants in a manner that protect its employees, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The Valspar Chicago, Illinois facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:  The Valspar Chicago, Illinois Facility manufactures industrial floor coatings and coatings resin.  The Urethane Resin Manufacturing process uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a raw material.  The facility stores TDI in 2,200-pound steel, pressure resistant cylinders.  Only one cylinder is used in the manufacturing process at any given time.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  The Chicago, Illinois Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.   Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational Procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.  The facility uses both procedural as well as technological systems to ensure safe handling of TDI.  The cylinder meets all of the Department of Transportation container specifications for shipment on highways"

      "SummaryText": ".  The transfer system is engineered to prevent TDI from leaking.  The facility has specific procedures for changing a cylinder.  \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The Valspar Chicago, Illinois plant has never had an accident involving TDI that resulted in injuries, property damage or environmental releases.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  In the event of an emergency involving TDI, plant personnel will notify the Chicago Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.  We have provided the fire department with our Emergency Response Plan and members of the fire department have inspected the plant.  In addition, Valspar has a contract with a qualified emergency response firm to aid in the cleanup of a release.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Valspar has an ongoing and continuing process to update and review our manufacturing process for safety considerations.  The facility plans on installing secondary containment to prevent any potential releases of TDI from leaving the building"
