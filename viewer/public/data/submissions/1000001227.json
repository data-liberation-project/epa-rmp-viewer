      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPadre Dam Municipal Water District services Santee and the surrounding area by providing quality drinking water and sewer services. Padre Dam Municipal Water District's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Safety & Risk Manager administers the District's safety and environmental policies. The Safety & Risk Manager is responsible for various inspections of the District's facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nLocation of Padre Dam Municipal Water District Water Recycling Facility (WRF) is 12001 North Fanita Parkway, in Santee, California 92071.  Padre Dam Municipal Water District's WRF began operations in 1967.   \n\nThe WRF used chlorine injection until 1975, when it was discontinued due to a change in operations. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide were re-introduced to the facility in 1996/97 as a result of an upgrade and expansion of the WRF to a 2 million gallons per day (MGD) facility.  The WRF treats wastewater as per the requirements of Title 22 reclaimed water standards for distribution into a reclaimed water system within the Santee region.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe chlorine feed system consists of one ton containers which are the storage vessels for chlorine.  Chlorine gas is drawn from a single one-ton container at a time through a vacuum regulator to the chlorine feeder units.  (A second container is connected in stand-by mode.) Still under vacuum from the chlorine feeder units, the gas is drawn to injectors and m"

Sulfur dioxide gas is drawn from a single one-ton container at a time through a vacuum regulator to the sulfur dioxide feeder units. (A second container is connected in stand-by mode.) Still under vacuum from the sulfur dioxide feeder units, the gas is drawn to injectors and mixed with water for distribution through-out the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide is 4 tons (8,000 pounds).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Padre Dam Municipal Water District has an aggressive and active safety program in place to manage the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas. Practices and procedures for proper chlorine handling were obtained from the Chlorine Institute Manual for the Safe Handling of Chlorine. Because sulfur dioxide gas is nearly identical in physical properties to chlorine and is stored and fed in identical cylinders as chlorine, same safety  practices are used for sulfur dioxide.  In addition to plant safety program for the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, there is a gas detector in the chlorine storage room and the feed room. At a chlorine concentration of 4 ppm, the detection system will activate a visual/audible alarm and the scrubber system.   In each of the sulfur dioxide rooms (2), there is a gas gas detector that will activate a visual/audible alarm and water mist sprinkler knockdown system at 4 ppm sulfur dioxide concentration.\n\nThe entire chemical feed system at the facility is tied into a Factory Link - NT computer system(s) that monitors and operates the facility.  In the event of an accidental release, detected by either activation of a scrubber or a sensor within the storage bu"

The auto-dialer system also notifies other District personnel in addition to respond as backups or first entry individuals to mitigate the leak.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment (April 2009), the five year accident history (April 2004 - April 2009) shows that there have been no reportable releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide since that time.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Padre Dam Municipal Water District, Water Recycling Facility (WRF) , has an effective and well implemented emergency response plan. This Plan has been developed and designed with the following in consideration:\n\n1.  To protect the lives of the WRF staff, support activities related to release prevention and mitigation, and to protect ANY public receptors within the toxic endpoints of an accidental release.\n\n2.  For the purpose of mitigating all potential releases from the WRF and to prevent  injuries.\n\n3.  To minimize damage to property and to the surrounding environment.\n\nPadre Dam MWD has taken on an aggressive hazardous materials emergency response training program to prevent any potential releases from the WRF. WRF personnel and Water System Operators are First Responders - Technician Level and trained to respond to a chemical release.  The WRF is equipped with a 16' Hazmat Emergency Response Trailer which contains the tools and communication equipment necessary for an effective response to a chemical release, including, but not limited to Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, Level A suits, rubber boots, radios, etc. First Responder training includes an annual drill of a postulated hazardous material release coordinated with the Santee Fire Department, the City of San Diego Hazmat Unit and the County of San Diego Hazmat Unit.  \n\nAll  personnel actively participate with the safety training and planning for the facility.

      "SummaryText": "RF's Hazardous Materials Business Plan as well as the safety plan provides the personnel organization and notification needed to effectively attend to chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical release issues.  The Emergency Response Plan identifies health hazards and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively should an emergency situation arise.  The plan is an active part of the operation of the WRF and as such it is updated on a regular basis and not less than once per year.  All effort are made to ensure that the Plan meets compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Padre Dam MWD has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the WRF.  The annual emergency response drills are documented and mitigation measures to improve the Team's response are continuously being reviewed. Padre Dam MWD has implemented all recommendations from the initial technical studies, as well as all recommendations from the latest PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (September 2008). \n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the District employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.   Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
