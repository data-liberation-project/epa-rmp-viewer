The RWTF biologically treats and disinfects wastewater prior to discharging to Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) ditch D132-00-00, then to Brays Bayou then to the Houston Ship Channel/Buffalo Bayou Tidal in segment No. 1007 of the San Jacinto River Basin.  \n\n     \n\n     The Chelford City RWTF is owned by Chelford City Municipal Utility District (MUD), and operated by Si Environmental LLC (Si), a private company.\n\n     \n\n     The permitted average flow of the treatment plant is 11 MGD.  Treatment operations include mechanical fine screening, complete mix aeration, clarification, disinfection with chlorine, de-chlorination with sulfur dioxide, gravity sludge thickening, aerobic sludge digestion and mechanical dewatering using an onsite belt press.\n\n     \n\n     Chelford City MUD and Si have reviewed their obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112 of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, Chelford City MUD and Si note the following obligations incumbent on the operations at the chlorine disinfection unit (also referred to as the chlorinator unit) at the RWTF:\n\n(1)    112 (1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Chelford City MUD and Si take this obligation seriously, and intend to be, not only a good neighbor, but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.  \n\n(2)    Risk Management Plan - Si operates the RWTF, which stores and uses chlorine in excess of the threshold specified in the RMP Rule.  Si has developed and implemented programs to prevent any accidental release and training for emerge"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\n     Only one of the 140 chemicals on EPA's regulated substance list is stored at the RWTF above the threshold.  This is the compressed liquid chlorine used in the disinfection process.  The maximum amount of chlorine contained onsite at any given time is 10,000 pounds.  This is stored in four one-ton cylinders.  The threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.\n\n\n\n     Si has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate a chlorine release.  These include maintenance, training, and inspection procedures, as well as an Emergency Action Plan, which has been coordinated with the local fire department.\n\n\n\n     Chelford City MUD and Si are committed to:\n\n?Preventing accidents;\n\n?Training employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n?Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n\n?Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and implementing all steps to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n?Being a good corporate citizen of Harris and Fort Bend Counties. \n\n   \n\n     With these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about the Chelford City MUD and Si's management of the risk associated with the chlorine disinfection process, but more importantly stresses the commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and community.\n\n"
