This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safe design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Company policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nNatural gas entering the Plant via pipelines flows into inlet separators from which free liquids are collected in a condensate tank. Collected condensate is transferred to another condensate tank located closer to the loading rack. A produced water tank used to hold materials coming off the inlet gas filter separator, slop water tank used to hold oily waste such as rainwater and oily water from the engine skids and a motor oil tank. Natural gas condensate, slop oil, produced water and oily waste are not regulated substances under the RMP.\n\n\n\nEngine-driven compressors compress the inlet gas prior to entering the mole sieve dehydrators. Dried natural gas from the mole sieve dehydrators enters the cryogenic expander plant that cools and expands the gas from which conditioned natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) are produced (the stationary source and regulated substances produced from this source are regulated under the RMP). The NGLs are separated (fractionated) into ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline products. Propane, butane, and natural gasoline products go to pressurized storage tanks. The NGL fractionator and product storage tanks are the stationary sources that handle regulated substances under the RMP. From the storage tanks the products leave the Plant via tank tru"

The conditioned natural gas, methane, (also referred to as residue/fuel gas) and lean plant bypass (field) gas (not requiring conditioning) are recompressed before entering a transmission pipeline as sales gas, which is not a stationary source for purposes of the RMP. \n\n\n\nThe substances handled at the Plant were evaluated for toxic characteristics and it was determined that there are no toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity handled at the Plant.  The natural gasoline, propane, butanes, NGL mix, and methane are flammable regulated substances under the RMP are present at the Plant in excess of threshold quantities.  Based on the worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors and because the Plant is subject to OSHA PSM program, the Plant is classified as Program level 3 under the RMP.\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances Worst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1-psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion assuming an instantaneous release.  A yield factor of 10% of the available energy released in the explosion is used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  In case of the Plant, natural gasoline is the worst-case flammable release with 0.55-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances Alternative-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nA hypothetical, but likely to occur, alternative release scenario involving butanes has been identified as follows:  a 3-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared off during loading, causing the entire contents to empty from the truck tank.  The butane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1-psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an e"

The alternative-case release of butanes resulted in a 0.30-mile distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.06 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic substances held above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required for this Plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program implemented at the Plant.  Because the processes at the Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the PSM program at the Plant is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent and/or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nThe Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include safety committees (which are made up of a cross-section of employees and supervisors), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, hazcom, etc.). Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they h"

The PSI is useful to the operators, team performing PHAs, those in charge of employee training, contractors and third-party vendors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans and emergency action plans.  PSI is incorporated into the PSM Manual and is readily available to all employees.  \n\n\n\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemicals properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with the written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

      "SummaryText": " controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if-Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the hazard analysis results are updated and revalidated periodically.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained in the PlantA?s files.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating p"

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.
