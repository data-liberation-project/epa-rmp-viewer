      "SummaryText": "Elementis Specialties New Martinsville (NMV) Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Elementis Specialties (ES) NMV site is a new operation located within a portion of the Bayer Material Science Industrial Park (Bayer) in New Martinsville, WV, pursuant to a lease with Bayer.  In August 2014, the NMV site started up two newly constructed processes, HASE thickeners and Dispersants.  Both processes fall under 29 CFR 1910.119 (PSM) and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP) regulations. Both processes manufacture products that have been produced by ES at other locations for several years and use similar chemistry and unit operations.  ES's experience from these operations were taken into consideration in the design, construction, and operation of the NMV processes.\r\n\r\nES has implemented a Basic Safety Process (BSP) standard.  In accordance with this standard, ES has developed a Safety Leadership Team which meets monthly to review current health and safety matters, status of open incident investigations, feedback from monthly department safety meetings, progress on completing PHA recommendations, PSSR findings, MOC actions, and internal audit findings. Minutes from these meetings are documented and reviewed periodically by senior management.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2 & 3:  Toxics Worst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe HASE process consumes a batch quantity of vinyl acetate (VA) as a raw material which is a listed Toxic Regulated Substance in Table 1 of \u00a768.130.  The threshold quantity is 15,000 lbs. Current formulation consumes 5530 lbs per batch and estimated maximum inventory will be 25,000 lbs.  The VA is received in drum quantities.  The Toxic Worst Case scenario is assumed to be a simultaneous loss of primary and secondary containment of all drums in inventory.  The Alternative Case is assumed to be a loss of primary containment (batch quantity in pre-emulsion tank) to secondary containment within the production building.\r\n\r\nThe Dispersants process consumes a batch quantity of 29% ammonium hydroxide"

      "SummaryText": "(AH) as a raw material which is a listed Toxic Regulated Substance in Table 1 of \u00a768.130.  The threshold quantity is 20,000 lbs.  The AH is received in bulk by tank wagon, with a maximum shipment  of 45,000 lbs., and stored in a 70,000 liter tank (125,000 lbs. maximum capacity).  The Toxic Worst Case scenario is assumed to be a catastrophic failure of the tank and secondary containment.  The Alternative Case is assumed to be a loss of a bulk shipment due to a ruptured transfer hose and loss of secondary containment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6:  Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, both processes are new operations and as such, there have been no accidents.  In addition, there have been no process safety related accidents in the last five years at the other ES manufacturing locations involving the HASE and Dispersant processes for the products that NMV will be manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7:  Prevention Program Level 3\r\n\r\n7.4 PHA - The original PHA was conducted during the engineering phase of both the HASE and Dispersants processes using ABS Leader software.  The methodologies used were HAZOP and Checklists.  Participants were:  PHA leader, two process engineers responsible for the manufacturing of HASE and Dispersants at other ES locations, NMV production engineer, NMV process engineer, ES and contracted project engineers, and HSE resource.  All recommendations from the original PHA were addressed by 8/1/2014.  ES requires that a PHA be conducted or an existing PHA be reviewed and updated prior to any new equipment being installed or changes to equipment design, specifications (both equipment and process), or operating procedures.  Requirements for conducting a PHA or updating an existing PHA are identified in the management of change (MOC) procedure. \r\n\r\n7.5 Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for both the HASE and Dispersant processes.  The procedures have been developed to meet PSM standards. Any changes to the operating procedures"

NMV plant operators have gone through extensive training for operating the new equipment, as well as procedures specific to manufacturing each product.  In addition, all NMV personnel participate in monthly safety training which includes but is not limited to:  hot work permitting, confined space permitting, lock out/tag out procedures, line break permitting, HAZCOM, incident investigation and reporting, PPE requirements, fork truck safety, and respiratory protection.\r\n\r\n7.7 Maintenance - NMV has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity inspection and preventative maintenance program (MI/PM).  The MI/PM program covers pressure vessels, atmospheric storage tanks, pressure relief/vent devices, piping, pumps, high speed rotational equipment, electrical systems, and safety related instrumentation.   Inspection procedures conform with RAGAGEP where applicable and PM programs are in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  \r\n\r\n7.8 MOC - The NMV site utilizes the ES corporate MOC database.  This database is a Lotus Notes based network system designed to comply with the PSM standard.  The database provides electronic notification and tracking for approvals and all actions associated with each MOC.  NMV requires that any changes to equipment design, specifications (both equipment and process), or operating procedures must follow the MOC procedure.\r\n\r\n7.9 PSSR - A PSSR was completed prior to the startup of each unit operation within the HASE and Dispersant processes.  The ABS Leader software was utilized to both design and document the PSSR.  NMV requires that PSSR's be conducted anytime new equipment is installed, replaced, or taken out of service and restored to service.  Requirement to conduct a PSSR is identified in the MOC procedure.\r\n\r\n7.10 Compli"

This audit will utilize external, globally recognized consulting firms, as well as internal experienced auditors to review health, safety, environmental, process safety, and security compliance.  For processes which fall under the PSM and/or RMP standards, a separate audit will be conducted by a person knowledgeable of each regulation and documented.  Findings, as well as recommended industry best practices, are documented and the NMV site will be responsible for responding to each item.  Progress on completing actions will be tracked via the BSP.  \r\n\r\n7.11 Incident Investigation - NMV utilizes the ES HSE Reports database for documenting and managing all incidents, investigations, corrective actions, and approvals.  The ES HSE Reports database is a Lotus Notes based network system designed to comply with the PSM standard.  The database provides electronic notification and tracking for all corrective actions and approvals for each incident.  The database allows for the categorization of incidents (e.g. near miss, safety, environmental, fire, security, etc), as well as specific details to each incident that can be used to identify specific trends that can then be used to improve the overall EHS performance for each location and ES.\r\n\r\n7.12 Employee Participation - NMV includes members from its workforce in incident investigation and PHA's and the participants are documented in the actual reports.  Requirements for participation are documented in the NMV Employee Participation procedures.  Employees are also encouraged to bring to their supervisor's attention any safety concerns, as well as any suggestions to improve safety in the monthly safety meetings.\r\n\r\n7.13 Hot Work Procedure - NMV has a documented procedure that complies with 29 CFR 1910.252 standard, as well as ES policy and Bayer procedure.\r\n\r\n7.14 Contractor Safety - NMV has a contractor evaluation process that requires a safety performance"

In addition, each contractor has an approved list of employees who have received safety training and are cleared to work on site.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 9:  Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nAs part of the ES lease with Bayer, Bayer has agreed to provide emergency response to the NMV site.  Bayer emergency response team (ERT) is trained (and certified where applicable) to provide HAZMAT response, firefighting response, and medical response.  There are 110 ERT members divided across all shifts that receive 16 to 80 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training such as firefighting, incident command, and HAZMAT.  Bayer has certified EMT's on site for each shift, a physician on site one day each week, a full time nurse, and medical procedures coordinated with local hospitals.  The site is equipped with both a fire truck and ambulance. The emergency response team is maintained on all shifts and can be activated either via 2-way radio or by phone.  Bayer has developed a Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) plan, as well as, coordinates emergency planning with the Northern Ohio River Industrial Mutual Aid Committee (NORIMAC), LEPC, and local emergency response agencies.  Community warning sirens are maintained by Bayer in local residential areas within 2 miles from the plant. The Bayer emergency response team has incorporated the chemicals used in the NMV processes into its response plan and provided the necessary training."
