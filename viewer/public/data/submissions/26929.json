This process, (ID #10) is an integral part of the winemaking process. Operations consist of the transfer of sulfur dioxide from one-ton and 150 lb. cylinders into smaller gauging cylinders that are used for dispensing the gas into wine and tank headspaces. The process uses gravity assisted by inert gas counterpressure to provide the motive force.\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe Worst Case Release Scenaraio for this facility would be the release of 2,000 lbs. of sulfur"

Using EPA's LandView mapping and census information program the population within the zone of influence was estimated at 1,800. The only other public receptor located within the zone of influence was Turner School. No environmental receptors were located within the zone of influence.\n\nAs required, an alternative release scenario was also analyzed for sulfur dioxide. This scenario was a release of the contents of a 150-lb. sulfur dioxide cylinder when its main valve was sheared off by vehicle collision. This scenario was calculated based on a release duration of 5 minutes. This scenario was chosen because it was determined to be the more likely than the worst case release scenario.\n\nRMP*Comp was used for the analysis and yielded a distance of 0.2 miles to the toxic endpoint. Using EPA's LandView mapping and census information program the population within the zone of influence was estimated at 6. The only other public receptor located within the zone of influence was Turner School. No environmental receptors were located within the zone of influence. These results were not surprising, as the facility is located in a rural agricultural area with very low population density.\n\nIn order to generate a conservative estimate of the potential consequences, mitigatons were not considered in the analysis of the worst case or alternative release scenarios. Mitigation methods are available and would be invoked during an actual release so that the actual consequences would be significantly less than predicted by these scenarios.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide facility is equipped with a manually operated water curtain. It is estimated that this system will effectively absorb approximately 80% of any forseeable release.

In addition to written procedures, specific training is provided initally and refresher training is provided as needed to all employees who work with the processes. General safety inspections conducted under the IIPP are also used to ensure compliance with SOPs. Annual inspections are conducted for Storm Water Pollution Prevention compliance,  Hazardous Material Inventory Reporting, and Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting  requirements. All programs and policies are designed for compliance with all applicable environmental and safety regulations including Title 8 CCR General Industry Safety Orders\n\nEmployees are directed to report immedately any minor leakage or other abnormal conditions that might be indicative of an imminent accidental release. These reports are directed to the Maintenance Department at once and top priority is given to correction of the deficiency. \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the past 5 years there have been no serious accidents involving this process.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIt is the goal of the Company to be as self-sufficient as possible in response to controlling and containing releases of hazardous materials or other emergencies. At the same time, we recognize that people can get hurt and a bad situation can get worse quickly when inadequately trained and equipped personnel get involved. It is for this reason that our emergency response program will always use a combination of response strategies.

Currently in the planning stages is a dedicated Plant Safety Day during which all plant operations will be shut down and employeest will participate in safety training covering as many topics as can be worked into a single day. It is anticipated that this event will occur at least once per year and possibly more frequently. We believe that the benefits of dedicating an entire day to safety will pay dividends well in excess of the costs.\n\nIn additition, a policy of zero tolerance for nuisnace leakage of toxic gases will be promoted to encourage employees to maintain a higher level of vigilance in prevention of accidental releases.\n\nConsideration is also given to upgrades of certain equipment as new technologies and standards are developed and proven. Where feasible and cost effective, upgrades for compliance with new standards and methods are reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\nIt is consideration of upgrades in technology, training and procedures that allows a facility to continue to improve its Risk Management Program and demonstrate its commitment to protection of human health and safety, property, and the environment."

The facility was originally constructed in 1946 and was aquired by Sebastiani Vineyards in 1988. It has always been operated as a wine grape processing and wine production facility. The facility is currently dedicated to the production, packaging, and distribution of premium table wine. All process and operations conducted at the facility are integral parts of the winemaking and distribution process.\n\nOperations conducted at the facility include processes that use certain substances identified in federal and state regulations as Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS). Sufficient quantities of these substances are used and stored at the facility to require the development and implementation of a Risk Management Program and submittal of a Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Risk Management Program and Plan (RMP) is to prevent accidental releases of toxic substances. The secondary purpose is to develop the information necessary to prepare facility personnel and public agencies to respond adequately and appropriately to releases when they do occur.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nIn matters of safety and environmental protection, Sebastiani Vineyards (The Company) maintains a proactive stance, from senior management on down. As a labor-intensive agricultural based industry, we are firmly dedicated to protection of our natural and human resources. It is our goal to be prepared and self sufficient to handle any forseable emergency and the Management believes that preparation and training are the best way to meet this goal. It is company policy however, that no employee will take unnecessary chances, and if a situation is beyond the expertise or resources of facility per"
