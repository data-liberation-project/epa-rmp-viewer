Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety.  The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n save lives;\n minimize and avoid injuries;\n protect the environment; and\n minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with OSHA regulations.\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees, alert the on-site response team, and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).

The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, recirculators, pumps, chiller, Glycol Circulation System, and evaporators), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to chilled areas and/or glycol.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 28 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 155 psig on the high side.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n Pre-startup sa"

Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs at the facility. These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\nThe True West Beef facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department. In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of True West Beef to enact the facility's Emergency Response Program, evacuate the employees, respond to the release with the facility's response team as needed, and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to assist in emergency response as needed. If an ammonia release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated.\nTrue West Beef personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, the facility Maintenance Manager, and the facility Safety Manager. The Safety Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe True West Beef facility is located at 6026 US-93 in Jerome, Idaho, which is on the US-93 freeway.
