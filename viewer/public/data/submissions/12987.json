Port Huron minimizes the risks associated with its chlorination system by:\n\n1. Development and implementation of a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in compliance with OSHA's  PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).\n2. Planning and training for response to an emergency.\n\nThe Port Huron WWTP has not had an accidental release of chlorine within the last five years.  The existing procedures and policies in place make such an occurrence extremely unlikely.  In addition, the Port Huron WWTP is in the process of converting the disinfection process to one which does not require the use of gaseous chlorine.  By the end of 2001, it is expected that the Port Huron WWTP will no longer store quantities of chlorine above 2,500 pounds, and therefore, will no longer be subject to the provisions of the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.\n\n THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [40 CFR 68.155(B)]\n\nPort Huron WWTP is a municipal wastewater treatment plant, which treats wastewater from within the City of Port Huron.  Chlorine is used in the disinfection process at the facility.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS [40 CFR 68.155(C)]\n\nAs required by the RMP Rule, the worst-case release for chlorine is a hypothetical situation in which the entire contents of the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes.  At Port Huron this is a release from a one-ton cylinder.  As the cylinders are at all times stored indoors, the storage building was considered to provide passive mitigation of this release scenario.  Port Huron WWTP minimizes the possibility of this type of release from occurring through the PSM Program that has been in effect at the plant since 1994.\n\nA number of alternative release scenarios were identified.  The one that a"

As in the worst-case scenario, the storage building was considered to provide passive mitigation.  Both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios have the potential to reach off-site receptors.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM [40 CFR 68.155(D)]\n\nThe Port Huron WWTP has developed and uses routine maintenance and operational controls to prevent accidents.  Prevention steps are listed in the Port Huron WWTP Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan.  Specifically, sections covering Process Safety Information, Operating Procedures, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Management of Change contribute to safe operation of the chlorination process.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted by the facility helps to identify potential problems before they occur.  This process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plant.  The most recent PHA conducted by the plant did not identify a need for changes to the chlorination process.  (Please note: Although no changes were deemed necessary during the most recent PHA, a glitch in RMP*Submit shows an error for field 7.4.c.  The EPA indicates that this field should be left blank when no changes are necessary.)\n\nAs described in the Training section of the PSM document, each employee with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling or use of chlorine is thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the chlorine-related work procedures relevant to his or her responsibilities.  Employee Participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM Plan at the Port Huron WWTP.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY [40 CFR 68.155(E)]\n\nWithin the last five years, the Port Huron WWTP has not had an accidental release of chlorine. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE"

Response to the off-site effects of accidental chlorine releases at Port Huron WWTP will be coordinated with the Port Huron Fire Department and other emergency response agencies in accordance with the Port Huron WWTP Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY [40 CFR 68.155(G)]\n\nAfter consideration of the identified release scenarios, the accident history, and a review of the latest PHA for the chlorination system at Port Huron WWTP, no changes to the system were deemed necessary by the plant.\n\nThe Port Huron WWTP plans to eliminate the need for chlorine in the disinfection process by the end of 2001.  At that time, Port Huron WWTP will no longer store chlorine on-site and will no longer be subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule."
