As part of this commitment, Reichhold has established a Risk Management Program that helps the company to identify and communicate risks associated with our operations, and reasonable controls have been established to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  In the unlikely event of a release of hazardous materials from the facility, specific plans are in place to reduce the effects upon our employees and the general public.  Reichhold has developed site-specific plans for emergency response that involve both our employees and local emergency service providers.  These plans are in compliance with the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) plan requirements, and follow the format provided by the RMP Data Elements published by the U.S. EPA (EPA form 8700-25).\n\n\n\nDescription of Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nReichholds Valley Park facility uses Toluene Di-isocyanate, commonly referred to as TDI, to produce a variety of urethane coatings.  TDI onsite in quantities in excess of the applicability threshold is subject to the RMP regulations.  In addition to TDI, Reichhold uses several other chemicals not subject to the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nPhysical security of the plant is maintained by a chain link fence topped by barbed wire that encompasses the site.  Site activities are monitored by fifteen TV cameras, with monitor ability in both the Security and Warehouse Offices.  Security guards are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nReichhold is dedicated to continuous improvement off its comprehensive environmental, health and safety program, which includes compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).  Employees are highly trained, knowledgeable, and skilled, which results in a work"

Employees are supplied with detailed information concerning their job duties, chemicals on site, and operating the processes.  The OSHA Process Safety Management Program is used to identify, correct, review and mitigate potential hazards associated with chemical processes.  Employee participation in the development and implementation of these programs is essential to ensure employee understanding and compliance with each element of the programs.\n\n\n\nReichhold has developed a strong Contractor Safety and Management Program.  Contractors and their employees are treated as though they are Reichhold employees while performing work at the Valley Park facility.  Contractors are trained on Reichhold processes and procedures, expected to participate as necessary in incident investigations, and are held to the same standards of performance as Reichhold employees.\n\n\n\nFinally, in an effort to continually improve these programs, regular audits are performed to determine the facilitys implementation and operation under these programs.  The audits are used to determine where additional efforts, program changes, or additional training needs to be implemented.  Audits also help to ensure compliance with the intent and requirements of Reichholds EH&S Program.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAll incidents and near misses with the potential to cause any injury or damages are investigated.  The regulations require the reporting of events involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site.  There have been no releases in the past five years that require reporting under the RMP Program.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nReichhold has a comprehensive emergency response plan that is coordinated with the St. Louis County Emergency Planning Commission and Valley Park Fire Departm"

The Emergency Response Plan provides clear roles and responsibilities, procedures, and corrective measures to be used in the event of an emergency that could threaten human health or the environment.  Along with emergency response procedures, the plan includes preparedness and prevention, notification, and post-emergency recovery procedures designed to minimize injuries to personnel and damage to property in the event of a fire, explosion, hazardous material release, utility outage, bomb threat, natural disaster or civil disorder.\n\n\n\nReichhold will respond to requests for information from outside agencies and the public.  Facility tours are provided for first responders and the Valley Park Fire Department and emergency medical/ambulance service, and the St. Louis County Police Department.\n\n\n\nTransportation of hazardous materials within the local area is included in planning activities.  The Emergency Response Plan considers chemical distribution safety and emergency response capabilities of local agencies by utilizing CHEMTREC, state and local networks.\n\n\n\nEmployees are trained and familiar with the contents of the plan, and their roles and responsibilities as specified in the plan.  Employees, as required, receive at least 8 hours of HAZWOPER training annually.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed annually, and updated as needed.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nReichhold works with employees, vendors, and Corporate EH&S support staff, and incorporates corrective actions identified through programs such as mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigation, and process hazard analysis studies to continually improve the safety of processes."
