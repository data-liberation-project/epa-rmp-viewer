PSSR recommendations are resolved prior to final installation or process start up.  Items completed prior to the intial process start up include piping and instrumentation diagrams, operating procedures and initial employee training.  \n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.  Equipment used to store, process or handle acetylene has been designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the potential for a release.  The maintenance program includes the required inspections/tests, the appropriate frequency, written procedures, and training of maintenance personnel, criteria of succesful test results, documentation of results and documentation of manufacturer recommnendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.\n\nHazardous work or non-routine work is controlled in a consistent manner.  The hazards identified are communicated to all affected employees and appropriate control measures are taken to prevent an accident release.  The program references and requires lock out/tag out, hot work, elevated work, line breaking and appropriate authorizations.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed to review proposed changes to the covered process.  MOC procedures include changes to equipments, processes or procedures that are not considered replacement in kind.\n\nProcess incidents that result in or could have resulted in (near miss)a release are investigated and documented.  The purpose of the incident investigation process is to ensure appropriate and adequate corrective actions are implemented to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.  Process incidents are investigated by a team that consists of management personnel as well as knowledgable employees.  All resolutions are communicated"

The audit includes an evaluation of the designe and effectiveness of the risk management system.  An audit tool is used to conduct the audit, document deficincies and track status of identified action items.  A procedure is in place to ensure appropriate follow-up.

Management and employees at the Miamiville facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the enviroment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacture, storage and distribution of acetylene gas.  Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of calcium carbide into water in a reactor vessel.  A chemical reaction takes place and acetylene gas is produced.  The acetylene gas is compressed and filled into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone.  The acetylene gas is dissolved into the acetone in the cylinder.  Each cylinder is checked by weight to verify they have the appropriate amount of product.  Cylinders are then stored for distribution.  \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario reports can be viewed at the facility and were prepared using the EPA look up tables and RMP*Comp.  Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system.  These reduce the liklihood of a release and are also designed to reduce the magnitude of release should it occur.  The mitigation methods include check valves, pressure relief devices, flash-back arrestors, vents, grounding equipment, purge systems and written maintenance and operating procedures.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents during the past 5 years.  \n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention plan designed to prevent accidental releases of acetylene.  The program utilizes technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.\n\nEmployees are frequently consulted concerning various aspects of the program and process and are asked to provide input rega"

This information was utilized to develop a PHA which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of an acetylene release.  The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non routine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process.  The PHA was reviewed and updated in January 2010 and is the purpose of this RMP submittal.

Training includews operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response, safety rules and procedures, routine and non-routine work authorization, and other pertinent process safety information.  Training is provided to employees by traditional classroom and hands-on methods.
