      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Public Service Company of Colorado (PSC) Fort St. Vrain Station.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Fort St. Vrain Station PSM/RMP manual for the chlorine system and the RMP manual for the ammonia system. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  As for emergency response, PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nPSC management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP and RMP manuals.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nFort St. Vrain Station is a gas-fired electric generating station.  The PSM and RMP regulated substance currently handled at this facility is chlorine.  The chlorine is used for cooling and process water biocidal control and is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 6 containers (12,000 lbs.) on site.  In 2001, the facility is adding a new process using 29% ammonia solution, which is regulated under the RMP rule only, and qualifies for RMP Program 2 requirements.  The ammonia is used for flue gas treatment and will be stored in one 14,230 gallon storage tank with a possible maximum inventory of 107,609 pounds.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine and Aqua Ammonia\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in "

Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant PSM/RMP and RMP programs, as well as ready access to program information.  Though this is not required for the ammonia system, employee participation has been voluntarily added to the RMP program.\n? Process safety information/safety information has been collected and summarized in the chlorine system PSM/RMP manual and the ammonia system RMP manual\n? Process hazard analyses (PHAs)/hazard review - The initial PHAs for the chlorine system were conducted in 1997 and 1998.  A PHA revalidation was conducted in January 2003.  All recommendations from the PHAs have been addressed.  The initial hazard review for the ammonia system was conducted in October 2000; an updated hazard review was conducted on January 17, 2001.  All recommendations from both sessions were addressed prior to initial delivery of ammonium hydroxide on-site.\n? Operating procedures for the chlorine and ammonia processes, which are available on-site in the Control Room and the FSV Station Library\n? Training for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia systems\n? Contractor management policy, which is to not allow contractors to operate or maintain the chlorine system.  While contractor managemnt is not required for the ammonia system, the PSC Contractor Safety, Occupational Health, and Environmental Program will be implemented for the ammoia system, which will involve contractor participation in initial system startup, and system optimization, operation, and maintenance.\n? Pre-startup safety review procedure for implementation for significant system changes to ensure that the construction and equipment installation is according to design specifications, appropri"

Facility personnel conduct daily visual inspections of the chlorine and ammonia systems.  The date and equipment included in 7.7 b and c and 8.7 b and c address the most recent major PM activity.\n? Hot work procedures to require the evacuation of the regulated chemicals from the system equipment (using the Fort St. Vrain Station Maintenance Clearance Procedures) before hot work is performed on the chlorine or ammonia system.  While this is not required for the ammonia system, hot work procedures have been voluntarily added to the RMP program.\n? Management of change program to ensure that proposed system changes are comprehensively evaluated before implementing the change.  While this is not required for the ammonia system, the management of change program has been voluntarily added to the RMP program.\n? Incident investigation procedures for the investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the chlorine or ammonia system, using the PSCo Root Cause Investigation Report form\n? Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the Fort St. Vrain Station chlorine PSM/RMP program and the ammonia system RMP program.  Since this facility's chlorine system was installed in 1998, an audit was conducted in February 2001.  The ammonia system was installed in 2001.  Both systems were audited in February 2004;  there were no regulatory findings of non-compliance.\n- Trade secrets provisions allowing contractors and employees"

This element is not required for the ammonia system, as it is not regulated under the OSHA PSM standard.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine or of ammonia meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP and RMP compliance manuals and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Fort St. Vrain Station PSM/RMP and RMP programs, process hazard analyses and hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations were implemented, all were considered.  The exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.\n\nAdditionally, though the ammonia process is regulated by RMP Program 2 requirements, PSCo has determined to "
