This rule was published in the Federal Register of June 20, 1996 and is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).  It requires owners or operators of a covered stationary source to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999.\n\nSenate Bill 1889 requires California to implement the federally mandated Accidental Release Prevention Program.  Effective January 1, 1997, the new California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) replaced the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  Under the CalARP program, the owner or operator of a stationary source is required to submit a single RMP to the local \"Administering Agency\" (AA) integrating the federal and state-specific requirements.\n\nTo comply with the federal and state regulations, McWhorter Technologies, Inc. (McWhorter), prepared this RMP for its facility located at 2801 Lynwood Road in Lynwood, California, with assistance from QST Environmental Inc. (QST). Based on the data collected and federal and state regulations applicability analysis conducted by QST, it was determined that toluene diisocyanate (TDI) system used in the polyurethane resin production is the covered process; because the quantity of TDI stored at the facility exceeds the regulatory threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (under federal regulations) and 500 pounds (under California regulations) for this chemical.\n\nThe facility is subject to Program 1 requirements because the offsite consequence analysis that was performed by QST indicated no offsite impact from the TDI process under the hypothetical worst case scenario. There are no public and environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone. Additionally, there has been no accident with offsite consequences within the last five years. \n\nMcWhorter has its own written emergency response plan and has coordinated the em"
