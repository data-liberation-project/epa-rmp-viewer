      "SummaryText": "Background\n\nThe Tekni-Plex facility in Somerville, New Jersey produces extruded polystyrene foam products using difluoroethane as the expanding agent.  The facility consists of manufacturing areas, storage warehouses, and offices, with a difluoroethane storage tank located outside of the building.  The facility operates as much as 24-hours per day, 365 days per year and employs approximately 189 people.  Our foam products are used in products such as food packaging trays.\n\nProcess Description\n\nDifluoroethane is the only material at the facility subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program. Difluoroethane is received by Tekni-Plex as a liquid in tank trucks and is unloaded into a storage tank located outside.  The maximum difluoroethane storage quantity is 85% of the tank design capacity to allow room for emergency expansion under emergency situations.  Difluoroethane is pumped through a controlled system into the foam production building.  The difluoroethane is then used to expand melted plastic within the extruders to create the desired foam product.  A number of valves, controllers, and instruments control and monitor the pressure and flow of the difluoroethane throughout the process.\n\nThe primary hazards associated with the difluoroethane system are releases that could occur outside or inside the extrusion building that could lead to a fire or explosion.  The possible causes of releases include pump failure, failure of piping or tubing, failure of valves or instruments, storage tank leakage, or failure of equipment used for tank filling.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases of difluoroethane in the last five years.  \n\nProgram Level Description\n\nThe worst-case results categorize this process as a USEPA Program 1 facility, however, the facility has filed as a Program 3 facility with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), as required.

This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the RMP.  Tekni-Plex has invested significant manpower and resources to prepare and implement this RMP and the related Process Safety Management (PSM) program to address the potential hazards associated with difluoroethane at the Somerville facility.  The facility's RMP/PSM program contains a Prevention Program that focuses on prevention of releases.  The Prevention Program includes the use of appropriate equipment design standards, safety valves and instruments, written operating procedures, employee and contractor training, regular equipment inspection and maintenance, and periodic program auditing to reduce the likelihood of difluoroethane releases occurring.  The facility has compiled process safety information and has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) review of the difluoroethane system.  The difluoroethane storage tank was designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code for pressure vessels.  The difluoroethane system was designed and constructed in accordance with the applicable portions of the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) 58 LP-Gas Code and is equipped with a variety of modern safety equipment.\n\nThe facility has implemented administrative controls and procedures to aid in the prevention of releases from the operation of the difluoroethane system.  Personnel operating and maintaining the difluoroethane system undergo regular training.  The training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.  Written operati"

      "SummaryText": "ng procedures are used to standardize the procedures for startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  Tank loading is conducted by contract truck drivers certified to safely handle LP-gases and monitored by trained Tekni-Plex personnel.  The facility conducts regular planned inspection and preventative maintenance of the difluoroethane system equipment.\n\nRelease Detection and Emergency Response\n\nThe plant has 16 gas detectors located throughout the facility.  The detectors are designed to warn an operator of a potential difluoroethane release and automatically shut down the process under certain conditions.  Automatic sprinkler systems are located throughout the building areas where difluoroethane is present and at the difluoroethane storage tank.  The facility has an emergency response plan that addresses emergency response procedures in the event of a leak, fire, or explosion.  According to the emergency response plan, Tekni-Plex personnel are required to contact the North Branch Fire Department in the event of any emergency.  The facility has coordinated with the North Branch Fire Department with regard to emergency response on the difluoroethane system.  For additional information on what actions to take in the event of an emergency, contact the North Branch Fire Department.\n\nAdditional Steps to Improve Safety\n\nTekni-Plex has created a culture for continuous improvement of its safety systems and programs.  We have trained our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  We also encourage our employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help to increase the safety of the facility.  We perform inspections and preventative maintenance to minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of our equipment.  Our systems and programs are audited, typically by an outside company, at least once per year to evaluate their effectiveness.  In addition, we regularly review and modify, as necessary, elements of our Prevention Program."
