      "SummaryText": "Arena Terminal\nEPA Risk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\nBy Randy Hartung V.P of Operations\n\n\nCorporate Approach to Chemical Safety\n\n\tHartung Brothers Inc. believes that public safety begins here at our location as many of our employees are envolved with the handling low level fertilizer material.  We contract with other professionals to blend highly volatile products like anhydrous ammonia on our site to be stored and used as fertilizer for the area agricultural community.  The handling of all the products we use is very important and should be done so as though they are all highly dangerous.  Each facility was designed to capture any controlled release of liquid product from an accidental spill while loading a vehicle or the blending of different materials.  \n\n\tOur employees are trained to handle emergencies from chemical spills to health related injuries and emergencies, including the use of CPR and an automatic external defibrillator (AED).  We train in the required safety course of the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection (WDATCP), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the local Fire Department.  Or staff routinely updates our Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and files annual reports with the County Emergency Management of each county we are in the State of Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Through all of the different reports and training our staff and management do each year we have committed ourselves to maintain a clean environment to live and work because it is the environment we all live in.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\tThe Arena facility handles one product that requires this facility to report to the above mentioned institutions and organizations and that product is anhydrous ammonia.  We use anhydrous ammonia to blend with phosphoric acid to make a ploy phosphate fertilizer commonly called 10-34-0 ammoniated poly-phosphate, and that is the product we store and sell.  The anhydrous ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia used in this blending process is shipped in to our locations via railroad cars and off loaded by trained, licensed and certified contractors who mix these two products in a special blender and then cool the product down before they pump it in to our tank.  Our personnel do not touch these operations and are not involved in the blending process, this is done for safety and quality issues.  The blending and unloading of these products are very specialized and as such we believe it is best done by personnel that handle these products all the time\n\n\tThe anhydrous ammonia is on our railroad siding for less than a week and is secured by a fence in with a camera monitoring any movement.  The cars are opened by trained professional and handled by those same trained personnel.  As for all the other non-hazardous products we have on site we take great care to see to it that if a leak should occur we are ready with equipment and knowledge to contain that leak and manage the clean-up so zero environmental damage results.  Hartung Brothers do not store hazardous materials in our tanks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\tThe contractors who manage the unloading of the anhydrous ammonia use many tools and control systems to prevent any accidental releases.  Remote controlled shut-off valves, pressure relief controllers and temperature monitoring systems are all connected via a computer system that measures hundreds of data points constantly and will shut down the blending process at the first time a problem begins.  These blending safety systems are backed up by FRA Railroad Safety procedures and car security training to maintain a safe working environment for everyone.\n\nAccident History\n\n\tThe Arena facility is a relatively new terminal but we are very proud of our safety record.  Not only have we not had any hazardous material releases we can all so boast of a zero personal injury record.  This can only be done with attentive employees who care about the work they do.

      "SummaryText": "Brothers are very proud of the safety record at this location.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\tAll of the Hartung Brothers terminals have and maintain an Emergency Response Program and procedure manual.  This is a living document that is updated and reviewed by all approved personnel responsible for the safety and operation of the terminal.  A copy of this procedural manual is located at the entrance of each location so that in the case of an emergency a first responder can have access to the manual.  Although we do not carry out emergency safety drills with our local Fire Department they have been on site on many occasions to review our processes as well as the anhydrous ammonia handling.  As mentioned earlier, we also maintain an Emergency Government manual with each county we operate in as this document is required by the state.  The County Emergency Management program is the most valuable to us as it deal directly with the release of a dangerous substance in such a way as to how to mange an evacuation of our area should a release happen. \n\nChanges to the Safety Program\n\n\tHartung Brothers are constantly reviewing the safety program at each location to ensure everything is done to provide a safe working environment to our employees and the neighborhood in which we operate.  To that end we are sponsoring a Railcar Safety Training Program this fall at the Arena Terminal for local and area Fire Departments and Emergency Government personnel.  This program will include a special railcar, provided by the ammonia supplier, designed to show emergency personnel how to deal with emergency with ammonia.  This program will take place in September and is open to any organization recognized by the Office of Emergency Management as an ammonia handler.  \n\n\tThe company maintains a monthly Safety Meeting chaired by one of the Terminal Managers with experience as a volunteer fireman.  This meeting provides all of us with a different prospective as to what is truly important to the sa"
