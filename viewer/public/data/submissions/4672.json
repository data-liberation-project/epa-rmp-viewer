The latest PHA date appears in item 7.4.b below. Pilot system used the HAZOP mehod for PHAs. The oxide tank systems have excess flow valves.  R100, R200 and the pilot reactor do not have scrubber systems. All of these units except R400 have had replacement units that are partially constructed.  The existing units are to be taken out of oxylation service after the new units are fully operational. The oxide tanks have dikes. Operating procedures were all reviewed between March and June of 1999. The inspection dates and last equipment inspected are based on major equipment records at time this form is being filled out, but subsequent inspections continue to be performed.",

Introduction\n\nWitco Corporation is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, contractors, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Witco Corporation has established a  system to help ensure the safe operation of chemical processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that is required by the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements (RMP Rule) in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan), which describes the risk management programs at the facility for review by the USEPA and the public.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWitco Corporation is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors, the public and the environment through  the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our personnel will respond to control and contain the releases.  In most foreseeable circumstances releases could be controlled by shutting down operations and/or by applying generous quantities of water to absorb and dilute the release since all of our regulated chemicals are water soluble. If necessary, Witco will evacuate onsite personnel and contact the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department and police to help handle the emergency and to help warn the public.\n\n3. Facility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Houston Plant stores regulated substance for use in several chemical processes. In each process the regulated substances are chemically transformed into less hazardous products. The oxylation and neutralization processes make products  used as ingredients in soaps for laundry and personal care, and additives used in the agricultural and petroleum industries. The sulfur dioxide is used as "

Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWitco performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating  both the worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for releases of toxic and flammable substances.  The worst case scenario is not expected to occur over the life of the facility.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might be a reasonable scenario to consider for emergency planning purposes.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of  an accidental release. This distance is called the endpoint distance. Knowledge of the end point distance is useful for emergency planning purposes and for helping to make appropriate accident prevention decisions.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance  would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible could be incapacitated.\n\nWhen considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast and windows could shatter.  Potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building collapse is unlikely.\n\nWhen considering the fire hazard of "

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration  is approximately 12 miles.  The population within a 12 mile radius of the plant is approximately 800,000 people.\n\nThe USEPAs models were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.2    Alternative Toxic Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenarios for all of the toxic substances were assumed to be leaks with no steps taken to mitigate the release. Water sprays onto leaks should be highly effective in knocking down vapors to reduce the impact of the leak since all of the regulated chemicals are water soluble.\n\nFor ethylene oxide the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.4 miles.  There are approximately 10 residences and some industrial and commercial neighbors within a 0.4 mile radius.\n\nFor propylene oxide the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.2 miles.  There are approximately 3 residences and some industrial and commercial neighbors within the 0.2 mile radius.\n\nFor aqueous ammonia the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.2 miles. There are approximately 3 residences and some industrial and commercial neighbors within a 0.2 mile radius.\n\nFor sulfur dioxide the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.4 miles.

This scenario is not much more likely than the worst case scenario for isopropylamine and the end point distance would be the same as the worst case release scenario. \n\nEthylene oxide and propylene oxide are flammable in addition to being toxic and Witco is taking precautions to manage the fire and explosion risks of these substances as well as the toxicity hazards.\n\n5.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Witco Houston Plant:\n\n5.1    Employee participation\n\nWitco encourages and insists upon employee participation in process safety management.  Knowledgeable operators write operating procedures, review new or modified product recipes, and are included in process hazard analyses.  Employees attend safety meetings, which are held about 6 times per month to provide ample opportunities for employees to attend. All meetings throughout the company (other than safety meetings) must begin with a safety topic to increase safety awareness and employee involvement. Several operators have been pulled off of regular duties for extended periods to review and comment on new designs and to help train themselves and others on major process changes before implementation. \n\n5.2    Process Safety Information\n\nThe Plant maintains extensive information on its chemical hazards, processes, procedures and equipment, which is used by employees as needed to help them do their jobs safely. \n\n5.3    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nNew and existing processes are examined using formalized methods of hazard analy"

Recommended actions are tracked until resolution.\n\n5.4    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Houston Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operation for the regulated processes, including normal operations as well as emergency and abnormal operations.  Operating procedure are available from document control department and control rooms where operators work.\n\n5.5    Training\n\nSafety training is conducted 6 times per month and the topics change each month. Process safety topics are covered during several months of the year.  The safety topics are posted on a safety calendar, which is available to employees. Initial training is provided to new employees.  Experienced operators train new employees on the proper operating procedures until they believe from direct observation that the newer employee is ready to run the process. Refresher training is conducted periodically.\n\n5.6    Contractors\n\nThe Houston Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased construction or maintenance activities.  Contractor's safety performance is reviewed before hiring the contractors.  Contractors are given safety training prior to being allowed to work in the plant to help assure that our safety procedures are followed. A permit system is in place, which requires contractors to obtain written approval in the form of a work permit from knowledgeable Plant personnel before work by a contractor commences on a regulated process.  Contractors are informed of the process hazards before written approval to commence work is given.\n\n5.7    Pre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR before any new or modified process is operated to make sure that the new or modified facilities and the associated procedures are safe to use for operation. \n\n5.8    Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility has an ongoing system to maintain the process equipment in good working orde"

New equipment and installations are inspected before they are operated to make sure they were constructed properly and are safe to operate. Equipment containing regulated toxic or regulated flammable substances are given the highest priority in the mechanical integrity system.\n\n5.9    Safe Work Practices\n\nThe facility has permit systems in place to make sure that hazardous activities such as hot work, entering vessels and confined spaces, and opening pipelines are performed safely by requiring that knowledgeable persons from operations and maintenance provide written permission before such work can be performed. \n\n5.10    Management of Change\n\nThe facility has procedures in place to manage changes to procedures and equipment safely.  Operations and engineering management personnel assure that changes are not authorized until it is safe to do so and the necessary safety requirements are met.\n\n5.11    Incident Investigation\n\nThe facility has procedures in place that require the reporting and investigation of incidents that result in or could reasonably resulted in a fire explosion or toxic release. Any urgent  recommendations resulting from the incident investigation are addressed promptly and other recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  A file is maintained to record the incident history for review and for consideration in the next process hazard analysis.\n\n5.12    Audits\n\nAudits are conducted every 3 years by the Corporate Safety and Health Department and reports are written to which the facility must respond.

This committee has met periodically to discuss ways to improve oxylation safety.  Members from several operating plants and corporate safety personnel participate in the committee meetings. Four members or former members of the oxylation safety committee are currently located at the facility and are available for advice on safety issues. Recommendations from committee members have resulted in numerous improvements in the design of systems for safe operation of the existing units and especially in the design of replacement units now under construction at the Witco Houston Plant. \n\nThe ethylene oxide and propylene oxide suppliers have well developed product stewardship programs and periodically visit the site to provide assistance in the safe handling of oxides and special training materials are provided.\n\nProcess controls now in place include numerous sensors, alarms and interlocks to detect and prevent hazardous upset conditions. Automatic shut off valves prevent the oxide from being added unless the process conditions are safe. Leak sensors provide alarms if leaks are detected and deluge systems are provided for tank, unloading and reactor areas to absorb leaks.  Dikes are provided for the storage tanks.  All of the vessels are protected with self closing relief valves and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere. \n\n6.2    Isopropylamine and Ammonia\n\nThe isopropylamine and aqueous ammonia are stored at ambient temperatures under  nitrogen blankets.  The tanks are located in a diked area with a nearby drain to a large wastewater basin.

Each container holds about 200 gallons, which is less than the threshold quantity of sulfur dioxide. The cylinder storage area is protected from traffic by a wall and steel barriers. The cylinders are not stored near other tanks or containers. The plant has repair kits to help stop leaks and leakage could be absorbed with firewater. \n\n7. Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Witco Houston Plant has not had any releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations or sheltering in place or environmental damage.\n\n8. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan.  The emergency response plan was issued to the Fort Bend LEPC.  The plant periodically conducts drills to train personnel and to test the plan. \n\n9. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nConstruction of facilities to replace over most of the existing oxylation equipment is nearly complete.  The new facilities are remotely located away from employees and the public and the new designs incorporate Witco's latest safety technology for process control, emergency shutdown systems, leak detection, emergency response, deluge systems, emergency cooling vents, vent scrubbing systems, and spill containment to contain both spilled material and emergency water.  \n \n"
