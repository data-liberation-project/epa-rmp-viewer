The elements of these standards have been combined to create one program document. \n\nThe executive summary is comprised of the following sections which are summarized below.\n\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2.\tFacility information and regulated substances\n3.\tGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\n4.\tFive-year accident history\n5.\tEmergency response program\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSaputo is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary. We are also coordinated with the District 6 LEPC MN which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION & REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Saputo \u0096 White Bear Lake facility is located at 4041 Highway 61 North, White Bear Lake, MN 55110. The plant\u0092s primary products include extended shelf life and aseptic dairy and non-dairy food products. The facility employs approximately 175 full-time employees. There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used in the plant\u0092s refrigeration system to provide refrigeration for processing and cold storage of dairy food products. This syst"

      "SummaryText": "em contains 15,410 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n?\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe Saputo \u0096 White Bear Lake plant follows the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management program as a release prevention program for RMP. In addition, Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Services works with the plant confirming regulatory and corporate standards are being followed, providing guidance and standardization on the RMP and OSHA PSM programs and acting as a resource for the plant on the RMP, PSM and other environmental programs.\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo \u0096 White Bear Lake has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSaputo \u0096 White Bear Lake developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials as well as other emergency events that might occur at the plant. The purpose of Saputo\u0092s Emergency Action Plan is to ensure employees know and understand what to do in the event of an emergency to minimize injuries and property damage. The plan includes various aspects of an emergency including adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Specific employees are trained and certified as medical responders. Employees are trained in evacuation, hazard communication, and chemical safety. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect pertinent changes.\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Recommendations resulting from the PHA, compliance audits and mechanical integrity inspections will be addressed in a timely manner. In addition, regular interaction with Saputo Corporate \u0096 Department of Refrigeration Service"
