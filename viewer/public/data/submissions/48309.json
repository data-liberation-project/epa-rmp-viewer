UAP Distribution, Inc. is the owner of this facility, having purchased it from Boettcher Enterprises, Inc. and Valley Fertilizer.\n\nFor further information contact: Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; Larry Brundridge, Location Manager, UAP Distribution, Inc., 815 East 4th, Concordia, KS 66901 (785) 243-2646.\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - the facility is located at 815 West 4th, Concordia, Kansas  66901, on the north side of Kansas Highway 9.  (785) 243-2646.\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n The maximum quantity stored would be 254,000 pounds, composed of 106,000 pounds in our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks, plus a total  potential of 148,000 pounds in 23, 1000 gallon nurse trailers and 7, 1500 gallon nurse trailers at design capacity of 85%.\n  \nOperating procedures for an emergency situation, unloading at a storage facility, and loading of ammonia nurse trailers have been updated as of 03/08/2007.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of both of the storage tanks, released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 106,000 pounds, which represents "

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  \n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n The facility has:\n\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR1910.38; a copy of the plan has been provided to local authorities.\n\nb.  provided a copy of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to local authorities.\n\nc.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know informat"
