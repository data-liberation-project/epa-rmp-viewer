Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe system contains numerous safety dev"

The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.
