This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\n    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Galena Park Terminal is a facility which receives and delivers liquefied petroleum gases (both mixed and pure), alpha olefins, and chemical feedstocks by ships, barges, trucks, and pipelines.  The facility also receives motor gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuels in the same methods for delivery to the Chevron Products Terminal located onsite.  The products onsite include propane, butanes, mixed pentanes (natural gasoline), pentane, isoprene and propane-propylene mix.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a natural gasoline storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere; having an offsite impact.  EPA's OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  This type of scenario is very unlike"

In addition qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this occurrence.\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a rupture of the 20\" pipeline between the imports area and a loading dock releasing refrigerated n-butane in a 1 minute period.  Passive mitigation used to limit the release are Emergency Shutdown valves located on each end of the pipeline.  The result of the release would have an offsite impact.  EPA's OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily, the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, which further reduces the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\n    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals),   1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes,"

The implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within the workforce.\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.\n\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\n\nThe Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.  Ensuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n    5 Year Accident History\nThe Galena Park Terminal has had an excellent accident prevention program over the last five- (5) years.  There have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances which resulted in offsite effects.\n\n    Emergency Response Program\nThe Galena Park Terminal maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and d"

Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\n\n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs that are on the market today.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
