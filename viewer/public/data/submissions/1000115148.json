The facility consists of two (2) above ground storage tanks, each of 30,000 gallon capacity.    There is one (1) vapor compressor and one (1) loading pump used to load trucks at a metered bulkhead.\n\nThe terminal siding has one (1) railcar unloading tower designed to connect to railcars and unload product to storage tanks, using  compressor.  The compressor withdraws propane vapors from the storage tanks and compresses them to a higher pressure.  The higher pressure vapor is discharged into the railcar to be unloaded.  The resulting decrease in storage tank pressure and increase in railcar pressure causes the propane to flow from the railcar into the propane storage tanks. \n\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains and Emergency Action Plan (EAP), complying with state of Washington regulations.  Plans include notification of the local fire department, law enforcement and medical organizations.  Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement. after consultation with site personnel. In the event of an incident, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem that can be controlled on site.   Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on-site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise. The EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards: \n1.\tNPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks: Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and how to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n2.\tOSHA's Occupational Safety and Health Standards"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures, and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter. The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines, and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via inspection and painting programs. \nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems are also installed on site. Shutdown systems include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment and isolate a problem once detected. Portable fire extinguishers are also available on site for employee use. \nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.
