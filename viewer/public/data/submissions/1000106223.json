      "SummaryText": "Marathon Pipeline, LLC (Marathon) - East Sparta is a petroleum pipeline facility distributing product throughout the Midwest area including various grades of refined liquids and gasses. The RMP regulated process is limited to the on-site Butane (normal) batch, gasoline blending process consisting of one pressure vessel, an offload station, pump, butane piping and associated appurtenances. \n\nThe East Sparta Station is committed to operating and maintaining the Butane Batch Blending process in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner.  Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe East Sparta Station is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community.  Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Marathon and East Sparta Station have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility/stationary source and its use of regulated substances (n-butane);\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs (Program Level 3);\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Butane Batch Blending process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances in excess of their respective threshold quantities are identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, i"

      "SummaryText": "t is necessary to observe certain safety precautions while handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to employee health, and minimize potential impacts to nearby members of the community.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces East Sparta Station's safety policies and procedures.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) approximate 90,000-gallon (water capacity) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into pipeline product movements.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, fusible/low-melting point element (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail-safe), automatic fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic (pressure) reliefs, and various pressure/temperature/flow related alarms. Access to the East Sparta Station is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and approved contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nEast Sparta Station's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/ response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to facility employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the facility:\n\n1) Employee Participation;\n2) Process Safety Information;\n3) Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs);\n4) Standard Ope"

East Sparta Station's employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, the facility also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of its operating procedures and engineering/administrative controls to help quickly detect, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and corporate standards (ex. NFPA 58);\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained personnel;\n-Redundant control systems with battery back-ups;\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, butane-containing components, and safety devices;\n-Secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n-Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantities;\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks;\n-Hydrocarbon detectors at key areas to warn of a chemical release and disable th"

In addition to the presence of appropriate release prevention controls, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is in place for the Facility with response activities are coordinated with the East Sparta Fire Department and supporting Marathon refinery fire department assets.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe East Sparta Station has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. As this is a new process, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials defined under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe East Sparta Station is identified as a Non-Responding Stationary Source and, as such, utilizes outside sources (East Sparta Fire Department and Marathon refinery) for offensive-type response actions.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the East Sparta Butane Batch Blending process, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the East Sparta Fire Department and Marathon refinery fire response located in Canton, OH to request their assistance.

The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the East Sparta Fire Department which has Butane process response training prior to startup.  In addition to startup training, the Fire Department participates in annual training/coordination events and is contacted about potential full-scale exercises.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMarathon is continually striving to make the East Sparta Station the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Marathon looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements per its Employee Participation program.  All process safety events (as defined in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed and/or investigated via root-cause analysis (ex. TapRooT) per corporate policy.  Additionally, the East Sparta Station works cooperatively with the community to address any concerns."
