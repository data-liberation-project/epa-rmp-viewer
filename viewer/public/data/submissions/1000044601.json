After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including demonstrated skills used to verify that the operator understood the training.  Process maintenance personnel are trained in their perspective duties for maintaining the mechanical integrity of critical process equipment and systems.  Operational and maintenance personnel also receive training on the procedures for conducting hot work permitting; management of change; and other appropriate safe work practices.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has procedures in place to verify that contractors perform their work in a safe manner.  These contractor safety procedures include steps to verify contractors (1) have the appropriate knowledge and skills to perform their jobs safety, (2) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules and (5) inform facility personnel of any potential hazards that they introduce or find during their work.

In addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor.  Chattanooga Propane Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with respect to their safety obligations, and provide contractors with applicable safety performance feedback.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal conducts a PSSR for any new or modified process that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and required safety systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR also verifies that appropriate safety, operational and maintenance procedures are in place, and adequate training has been provided to the appropriate personnel.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  When new facilities are commissioned, a PHA is included in the PSSR.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) utilization of appropriately trained maintenance personnel, (2) developing written procedures, and (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies.

If a deficiency is identified that presents an immediate safety concern, Chattanooga Propane Terminal personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these recommendations to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teamsA\u00bf recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.

The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal periodically revalidates these PHAs.  These PHAs are revalidated at least every 5 years, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process no longer contains hazardous chemicals above the threshold quantities.  The recommendations from these revalidated PHAA\u00bfs are also forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of each revalidated PHA recommendation is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed by qualified knowledgeable personnel and annually certified as current and accurate.  In addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the process.  New operational employees receive training on the Chattanooga Propane TerminalA\u00bfs operating procedures and basic training in process operations, if they are not already familiar with such operations.

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or other Chattanooga Propane Terminal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the facility has been coordinated with the Chattanooga Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic emergency response drills and meetings with the local fire department personnel.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal is manned 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communication capability with the local fire department.  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility personnel are continually developing ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with approved safety controls and devices.  Additionally, the facility will consider all safety measures resulting from safety audits, PHAA\u00bfs and safety meeting to mitigate potential accidents and to improve safety."

Employees also participate in safety meetings, resolving certain safety concerns, and updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information pertaining to the process and critical equipment.\r\n\r\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA\u00bfs accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participating plan that is maintained at the Chattanooga Propane Terminal.  This employee participation plan addresses each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Chattanooga Propane Terminal has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Chattanooga Propane Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, safety interlocks, suppression systems, vent and relief studies, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSA\u00bfs).  For specific process area, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures.  The Chattanooga Propane Terminal maintains the process within these limits by using process controls, monitoring instruments, training personnel, and protective instrument sys"
