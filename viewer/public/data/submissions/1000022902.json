      "SummaryText": "The City of Fortuna has instituted a Risk Management Program for their Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68 and CalARP regulations.  In 1999, the local Administrative Agency, Humboldt County Division of Environmental Health (HCDEH) requested that a Risk Management Plan (RMP) be submitted for sulfur dioxide, held at the Wastewater Treatment Plant in excess of California threshold quantities but below Federal threshold quantities at that time.  The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of California and Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  \n\nA Risk Management Plan was filed as required by ARP and CalARP regulations in 1999 for chlorine and an additional RMP was filed with HCDEH in 2000 for sulfur dioxide only.  This periodic RMP update is being filed in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  Sulfur dioxide is being included in this update due to its presence on site in quantities in excess of Federal RMP threshold.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Fortuna operates and maintains a wastewater treatment plant, located on the east bank of the Eel River in the City of Fortuna, CA in Humboldt County, and uses chlorine and"

There are 9 full-time employees at this site.  The plant is normally manned on the day shift 7 days per week, and a telephone dialer system alerts operators to alarm conditions when the plant is not manned.  \n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric trolley hoist, and stored under a roof and on scales inside the building.  150-lb. cylinders of chlorine and sulfur dixide are received by truck, handled within a steel rack by a forklift, and stored in the chemical storage room.  A sulfur dioxide 150-lb. cylinder is connected as a standby for a sulfur dioxide ton container.  A chlorine 150-lb. cylinder or another ton container is connected as a standby for a chlorine ton container.  The chlorine is used for disinfection of wastewater effluent prior to discharge, and for filamentous organism control in the activated sludge process.  The sulfur dioxide is used to remove residual chlorine from treated effluent prior to discharge to the watercourse.  Pressurized chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas within a container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves, metered through rotameters and rate valves automatically in proportion to flow, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Fortuna that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.

The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program as well.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include installation of a sulfur dioxide leak detector, and creating facility-specific written operating procedures.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Fortuna's Emergency Response plan applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases consists of site evacuation and notification of the Humboldt County Hazardous Materials Response Team by calling 911.  has been coordinated with Humboldt County Environmental Health D"
