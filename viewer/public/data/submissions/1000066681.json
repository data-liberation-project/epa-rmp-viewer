There are three (3) Freshwater Emergent Wetlands located in the endpoint radius for a worst case release of denaturant; however, there are not bodies of water (including creeks and rivers) in the endpoint radius. \r\n   \r\nAlternate Scenarios:\r\n1.      Anhydrous Ammonia: The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nDiamond Ethanol, LLC (Diamond)\r\n\r\nThis RMP resubmission is being submitted to fulfill the 5-year update requirement.\r\n\r\nDiamond is an ethanol fuel production plant located in Levelland, Hockley County, Texas.  The plant has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that could exceed reporting thresholds as a requirement of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nDiamond has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs. Diamond has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans have a minimum of annual training requirements to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. New employees are required to read the Plans listed above and undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. Diamond's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release if incidental.  In the event of an emergency, Diamond's employees are not responsible to respond.  The facility will utilize the local fire department as first responders.  In the event of a non-incidental oil release, Diamond has contracted with an off-site spill response contractor to assist first responders with containment and clean-up.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nDiamond is located in Levelland, Hockley County, Texas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol"

Anhydrous Ammonia - Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a release of 50% of the storage vessel, creating a toxic vapor cloud.

Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a  steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.
