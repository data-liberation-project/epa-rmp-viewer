The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and delivered to the final user location.  There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  \r\n\r\n1.3  \tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nRinchem Company, Inc. employs a number of administrative controls to limit the potential and magnitude of releases.
