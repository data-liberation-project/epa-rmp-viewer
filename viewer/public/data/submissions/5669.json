      "SummaryText": "are undergoing implementation and integration into\nroutine operation and maintenance practices at the VCWWTP.  Historical\nand future significant efforts focus on the following areas:\n\nA.   Development of a safety information database essential for the\n     successful implementation of other procedures, including\n     operation, maintenance, training, compliance audits, incident\n     investigation, and emergency planning and response.\n\nB.   Implementation of corrective actions recommended during the most\n     recent hazard review completed on April 22, 1999.  This effort is\n     one of the most important steps for preventing a chemical release\n     or minimize its effects on plant personnel or the public.\n\nC.   Regular review and revision of operating procedures to address\n     the safely operating procedures for regulated process systems,\n     including all eight (8) elements set forth in the regulation. \n     When combined with the operator training program, current\n     operating procedures are essential in  ensuring safe operation of\n     systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\nD.   Regular review and revision of training programs to ensure plant\n     personnel working on or near regulated processes are adequately\n     trained and understand both inherent process hazards and\n     appropriate response actions to accidental chemical releases. \n     Employees who have received adequate classroom and/or on-the-job\n     training and are currently qualified to safely operate the\n     regulated systems have received certifications  in writing by the\n     RMProgram Manager.  A special training session will be provided\n     to plant personnel working on or near regulated processes as soon\n     as final revisions to operating procedures are completed.\n\nE.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe VILLAGE CREEK WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT (VCWWTP) is owned and\noperated by the CITY OF FORT WORTH (CFW).  To comply with the\nrequirements in 40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the\nCITY OF FORT WORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk\nManagement Program (RMProgram) for the VCWWTP including Management\nSystem, Hazard Assessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the\nemployee and public risk of injury, death or damage from accidental\nrelease of chemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Assistant Director\nC.   RMProgram Manager\nD.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nE.   Safety Information Officer\nF.   Hazard Review Update Officer\nG.   Operations Manager\nH.   Training Supervisor\nI.   Maintenance Supervisor\nJ.   Compliance Audit Officer\nK.   Incident Investigation Officer\nL.   Emergency Planning and Response-Operations Officer\nM.

Storage, transfer and use of sulfur dioxide in dechlorination\n     system\n\nChlorine gas is stored as pressurized liquid in three (3) side-by-side\ntanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine inventory in each\ntank is 44,000 lbs.   The maximum process quantity is 132,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\nSulfur Dioxide gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in two (2) side-\nby-side tanks located outdoors.  Maximum liquid chlorine inventory in\neach tank is 44,000 lbs.   The maximum process quantity is 88,000\nlbs., ignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\n3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment has been completed for the VCWWTP.  Offsite\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\nprinciple elements:\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for chlorine\n     and sulfur dioxide worst-case scenarios.  A leak from a liquid\n     line near the outdoor storage tank was assumed for either\n     chlorine or sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario.\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in worst-case scenarios. \n     The excess flow valve, however, was considered for either\n     chlorine or sulfur dioxide alternative release scenario.\n\nD.   Distances to toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide\n     worst-case scenarios were modeled using a dense gas dispersion\n     model, DEGADIS.\n\nE.

Distance to the flammable endpoint for methane scenario was\n     determined using a TNT-equivalent model.\n\nG.   Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n     scenario.\n\nThe accidental release of sulfur dioxide from a storage tank is\nconsidered the worst-case scenario. A distance of 5.3 miles between\nthe release source and the toxic endpoint was modeled in the offsite\nconsequence analysis.  The alternative scenario impact distance is 1.3\nmiles for sulfur dioxide and 1.2 miles for chlorine.\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, LANDVIEW III estimated a population of\n220,000 persons within the worst-case scenario impact radius of 5.3\nmiles.  Populations are 5,400 and 3,300 persons for sulfur dioxide and\nchlorine alternative release scenarios, respectively.\n\nPublic receptors within the worst-case scenario impact area include\nschools, residences, hospitals, correctional facilities, recreation\nareas and commercial, office, or industrial areas.  Public receptors\nwithin the alternate release scenario impact area are schools,\nresidences, recreation areas and commercial, office, or industrial\nareas.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe VCWWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.
