If an emergency occurs, it is our policy to notify the Mt. Vernon Volunteer Fire Dept. and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA Description of your facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility retails LPG, primarily supplying residential and non-profit organizations. We also have an on-site cylinder refilling operation. The facility consists of (4) 30,000 gallon storage vessels of which (2) are used and the remaining (2) are earmarked for later use. We have never maintained an inventory of over 50,000 gallons at one time.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: Our worst case scenario is failure of (1) 30,000 gallon storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 0.5-inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe gen"

      "SummaryText": "eral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive year accident history: We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Mt. Vernon Volunteer Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. We have coordinated our response plan to the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system and conducted a joint exercise with us. The fire department is less than 2 miles from our facility which would result in minimal response time in case of an emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None"
