      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSynear Foods USA produces a large variety of frozen foods at its Chatsworth Facility that are frozen and then shipped to various points around the country.  The facility covers approximately eight acres and has the capacity to operate up to seven days per week.  The facility operates under strict federal, state, and company regulations for safety of its employees, its products and the environment.\n\n\n\nSynear Foods USA uses ammonia as a refrigerant in its frozen food processes.  By maintaining a comprehensive safety program for ammonia and documenting the program in this Risk Management Plan, Synear Foods USA complies with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards and California's and EPA's Risk Management (RMP) program regulations.\n\n\n\nSynear Foods USA realizes that constant diligence in operation and proper maintenance of the ammonia system can reduce risks to its Associates and to the public.  This RMP documents the procedures and controls in place to ensure that potential accidental releases of ammonia are prevented and to promptly respond to and mitigate any incident that might occur.\n\n\n\nThe RMP and PSM programs are applied to all on-site activities that could involve or affect the ammonia system.  The safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment.  These rules are reviewed at regular intervals and modified if required and they are communicated to, accepted, and practiced by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSynear Foods USA has modified and re-commissioned an ammonia refrigeration system that had operated under the previous facility owner, but has been fully evacuated of ammonia and out of service since the change in ownership.  Therefore, the ammonia process is considered a newly regulated process.  The commissioning of the ammonia s"

No chemical reactions or venting occurs in the normal operation of the system.  A total system capacity of approximately 33,000 pounds of ammonia is the maximum inventory maintained at the site.  System components include compressors, condensers, pressure-rated vessels, heat exchangers, piping and valves, instrumentation and controls, and other miscellaneous components.  The need to recharge the system with ammonia is very infrequent, but it is done by tanker truck as necessary.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia refrigerant (Ammonia) is not used in any chemical reactions.  Ammonia is used to transfer heat away from the cold storage rooms and food products in a continuous cycle of evaporation, condensation, and compression, similar to the cycle utilized by a household refrigerator.  The ammonia is continuously cycled throughout the system, so that make-up or replacement of ammonia is done infrequently.  Anhydrous ammonia is a clear colorless gas with a characteristic odor and, although it is classified as a nonflammable gas, it can burn within certain vapor concentration limits (assuming the presence of an ignition source), and the fire hazard will increase with the presence of oil or other combustible materials.  It is shipped as a liquid under pressure and it is soluble in water forming a corrosive liquid.  Although ammonia vapor is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak are typically cold and will initially hover near the ground until they warm up and mix with air.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSynear Foods USA has integrated program elements described in the RMP to deal with the risks involved with the storage and handling of ammonia throughout the refrigeration process.  In this way, overall plant, worker, and public safety is promoted.  The program elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - The ammon"

It is required that information on the design and operation of the facility be documented and maintained for as long it is in operation. A major component of the PSI are the piping and instrumentation diagrams, which are kept current based on any changes that occur to the design of the refrigeration process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The ammonia refrigeration system at the facility has been thoroughly analyzed for potential hazards using a trained team of facility personnel and experienced hazard analysis leaders.  The PHA study is revalidated at least every 5 years, plus any time significant changes are made to the ammonia system.\n\nOperating Procedures - Formal written procedures for operation and maintenance of our ammonia refrigeration system have been developed as part of our RMP.  Procedures provide steps for each operating phase, they also document operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  All Utility Mechanics review the written Operating Procedures to ensure the staff is properly trained.\n\nTraining - Synear Foods USA's refrigeration technicians have many years of experience in operating ammonia refrigeration systems.  Several of them have 4 year degrees in technical subjects in addition to their work experience.  Synear Foods USA certifies that their operators are competent.  As required by Synear Foods USA, all technicians have proper training either before or after they are hired and periodic refresher training is conducted at the facility.  Industry training certificates such as RETA CIRO have been achieved by most (if not all) ammonia operators on-site.\n\nMechanical Integrity - A comprehensive preventive maintenance program is in place at Synear Foods USA.

Hot work procedures, Lockout/Tagout procedures and others are used to document and control safe work practices.  Ammonia operators conduct and document daily inspections of the ammonia equipment in addition to the electronic recordkeeping that is done via the facility's computerized maintenance management software (CMMS).\n\nManagement of Change - Changes to the process, including chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures and changes to equipment that could affect the ammonia system are managed through use of a written management of change procedure.  Designated management personnel must authorize changes under this program element.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Review - Before a major change can be instituted, Pre-startup Safety Review requires that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, procedures are in place and adequate, process hazard analysis is performed and recommendations resolved and training is conducted.\n\nCompliance Audits - Under RMP, Synear Foods USA is required to evaluate compliance with the RMP regulations at least every three years. The most recent audit was conducted in February 2014 under the previous owner of the facility.\n\nIncident Investigation - The RMP requires that incidents which resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of ammonia be investigated promptly by a team of investigators with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. \n\nEmployee Participation - Employees are encouraged and required to participate in program development and enforcement.
