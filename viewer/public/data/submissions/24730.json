The station also has an SPCC Plan based on the requirements in 40CFR 112.  The Emergency Response Plan follows the OSHA HAZWOPER Regulations and includes applicable provisions from 40CFR 1910.120 and notifications as required under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA).  Tier II Reports are filed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\nB. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nMerrimack Station is a fossil fueled electric power generating facility owned and operated by Public Service Company of New Hampshire, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities of Berlin, CT.\n\nThe purpose of this facility is to generate electric power for sale via transmission and distribution lines to customers.  There are four separate units with a net claimed capacity of 478 megawatts.  Units 1 & 2 use coal fired cyclone boilers to produce steam that powers turbine driven generators capable of 113.5 and 320 megawatts respectively. Undesirable oxides of nitrogen (NOx) form during the combustion process.\n\nThe application of Selective Catalytic NOx Reduction Technology reduces nitrogen oxide air emissions from the station in excess of 80%.  The process uses anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance, as the reagent.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage, handling and use of anhydrous ammonia at Merrimack Station.\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction Technology (SCR) was installed to remove the NOx as part of the PSNH plan to comply with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  In the process, liquid ammonia is drawn from the storage tanks and converted to vapor which is mixed with air and injected into the flue gas upstream of the catalyst bed.  The ammonia vapor combines with the NOx in the presence of the catalyst to form inert nitrogen gas and water vapor which exit the stack.\n\nThree processes are covered under this Risk"

      "SummaryText": "Management Plan:\n\n1.  MK1 SCR DeNOx\n2.  MK2 SCR DeNOx\n3.  Rail cars awaiting offloading\n\nProcesses #1 and #2 are each made up of separate storage tanks, vaporizers and gaseous ammonia metering and injection systems.  The storage tanks are inter-connected through piping from the off loading station.  Only one rail car can be offloaded at a time.  Ammonia is stored in ASME pressure vessels as a liquid under pressure at atmospheric temperature in quantities  greater than 10,000 pounds which is the threshold quantity listed in 40CFR Part 68.130.\n\nProcess #3 represents all ammonia rail cars on site awaiting offloading.  Anhydrous ammonia delivery to the site is primarily by rail car.  The cars are parked on a separate rail spur.  None of the cars are connected by piping or hose to each other or to either Process #1 or Process #2.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  Locomotive operators are DOT trained and all employees are trained in the hazards of anhydrous ammonia.  Merrimack Station works closely with the Bow Fire Department (BFD) as the representative of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which participates in the Capital Area Mutual Aid.  Emergency response drills are conducted with the BFD.\n\n\nC. WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\n\u00b7 All modeling was done using the ALOHA software distributed by the National Safety Council,  NOAA and EPA.  The release was modeled as a dense gas as recommended for anhydrous ammonia stored as a liquid under pressure.  Population estimates were developed using Landview III software provided by the EPA, NOAA, USGS and Bureau of Census which includes the 1990 Census Data.  The year 2000 Census Data was unavailable at the time of this reporting.\n\u00b7 The toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as stated in"

This represents a concentration of ammonia below which a majority of the population can be exposed to for one hour without serious or permanent health effects.\n\u00b7 Worst-Case Scenario - This scenario is defined by the regulation 40 CFR 68.25 as the rupture of the largest single storage tank in a process when filled to the greatest amount allowed. It is assumed that the entire tank contents are released in 10 minutes.  The probability that such a failure would occur is low.  Administrative controls limit the maximum filling capacity of anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to 90.6% volume at 60 F based on standards set by ANSI K61.1.\n\u00b7 A worst case release would result in the toxic endpoint occurring well beyond the plant property and would impact a population surrounding the facility including the towns of Bow, Suncook, Hooksett and the City of Concord.  The Merrimack River, Bear Brook State Park and Interstate 93 would also be impacted.\n\u00b7 An alternative release scenario involving a hose rupture during offloading of a rail car was also evaluated.\n\u00b7 The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario is an area mostly over company property and the Merrimack River.\n\n\nD. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS. \n\nThe ammonia storage and handling facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The ammonia systems were designed \nand constructed in accordance with ANSI K61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the ASME Pressure Vessel Code to ensure design integrity.\n\nOur accident prevention program is based on the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan which is a 13 point program for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases.

Annual refresher training is provided to all employees.\n\nThe equipment is visually inspected daily and trouble reports are submitted when action is required.  Preventative maintenance is conducted on all safety related equipment and critical components based on the manufacturers recommendations or experience.  Pressure vessels are inspected according to the ASME and NACE guidelines.\n\nAny changes to the covered processes follow a management of change procedure that requires conducting a process hazard analysis on the proposed change and implementing the study group recommendations prior to operating the system.\n \n\nE. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMerrimack Station went into commercial operation in 1960.  The first use of anhydrous ammonia on site was in 1991.  There have been no reportable releases of ammonia or related impacts from the use of anhydrous ammonia to the health and safety of employees or the surrounding community.\n\n\nF. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is readily accessible and provides guidance to employees in the event of any emergency at the station.  Any person on the site discovering an emergency condition is instructed to notify the shift supervisor on duty who becomes the internal incident commander.  The shift supervisor will then initiate the on-site emergency response system.  The nature of the emergency will determine the course of the response.  Our first contact for immediate outside assistance is to the Bow Fire Department who is the LEPC.\n\nThe ERP includes guidelines and procedures to respond to specific release scenarios developed  during the consequence assessment conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68.165. The details of the ERP are periodically reviewed with the Bow Fire Department and they are invited to participate in our annual training program.
