It is each facility and/or Division Manager's responsibility to ensure that all Corporate, Division, and regulatory laws, rules, policies, and/or procedures are followed.  It is the responsibility of each employee to adhere to these laws, etc. and to conduct themselves in a safe manner when performing their tasks.\n\nThe Sealed Air Corporation has embraced and is committed to the \"World Class Manufacturing\" program; a portion of this program strives for safety and environmental excellence.  Audits are performed on each facility to ensure that the program is being adhered to and Division managers are responsible to correct any recommended deficiencies of an audit.\n\nThe facility has a safety operations program that supports worker and public health, safety, fire security and environmental issues.  The facility has written and published an \"Emergency Operations Manual (EOM)\" to provide guidance and procedures to follow in an emergency situation for in-house emergency commanders, management staff, and workers.  The manual's format is a \"what if\" type book that covers all emergencies that are perceived to be able to happen to the facility from security emergencies to chemical spills or leaks.  The facility has also organized, trained, and equipped an in-house emergency brigade covering all shifts and trained/equipped to OSHA 1910.156 regulations for an interior/exterior fire brigade.\n\nPreplans are a part of the EOM and the brigade trains on the plans.  The plans are reviewed annually and the brigade trains quarterly for fire suppression/prevention, annually for confined Space/High Angle Rescue, annually for Hazardous Materials Techician Review (OSHA 1910.120), annually (each shift) for total plant evacuation, and annually for first aid to the ERT American Red Cross level.\n\nN-Pentane delivery, storage, and use has a preplan in the EOM and is "

      "SummaryText": "a part of the \"Pentane Preplan\", which includes the sanitary sewer \"Slug Loading Prevention Plan\" as required by the City of Reading, PA., Bureau of Water and Sewer.\n\nB)  PROCESS OVERVIEW\n\nCRYOVAC Food Packaging Division is a converter of hard polystyrene resin pellets into soft foam sheet and then into tray type containers for the food industry.  The containers are used primarily as red meat packaging trays, poultry trays, and market ready type containers.  During the initial process, known as extrusion, the pellets are heated under pressure along with colorants and blowing agents in an extruder machine and then discharged as foam around a die and over a mandrel that cools and slices the foam into sheets.  The sheet is rolled on a winder and set to age.  After aging is complete, the roll of sheet is thermoformed by heating the sheet and molding the parts, which are cut out of the sheet and packed for customers.\n\nC)  OVERVIEW OF BLOWING AGENT\n\nOne of the blowing agents in foam manufacturing is n-Pentane, which is injected into the extruder barrel at high pressue and at low volume to assist in creating \"cells\" in the liquified plastic to manufacture foam.  The n-Pentane is pumped through a continuous loop system at relatively low pressue and returned to its underground pump storage tank.  Each extruder machine uses n-Pentane as required, on demand.  In addition to the pump storage tank, there is an additional underground storage tank that is a static (no pumps) tank and is interconnected (piped) to each other.  The n-Pentane is transferred from the static tank to the pump tank via a siphon pipeline.  Each tank holds 19,800 gallons and can only be filled to 90% due to safety interlocks installed in the filling system.  The receiving area, filling system, and tank storage are enclosed by a 10 foot high chain link fence which is inside the facilities 10 foot high and one foot barbed wire perimeter fence that is looked over by a contracted security force.\n\nN-Pentane is d"

A static grounding system is interlocked with the unloading air valve that stops the unloading action if the ground connection is interrupted.  The capture vault, tanker, unloading station, and the immediate area are protected by an AFFF firefighting foam fixed system that can discharge 2,300 gallons of foam per minute.  On occasion, n-Pentane is received by a rail tanker car of 30,000 gallons or 157,500 lbs. capacity.  The unloading method is essentially the same as for truck tankers.\n\nD)  WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case scenario assumes a flammable hydrocarbon vapor cloud detonation from a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) of a 30,000 gallon or 157,500 lb. Railroad tanker car.  RMP*Comp A? calculations for this volume of pentane.\n\nThe likelihood of an actual BLEVE of the tanker is unlikely due to the multilayered safety devices that have been installed at the unloading rack area.  In addition to passive safety devices, there are safe unloading procedures based on training programs that must be followed for safety management of the product.\n\nE)  ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe more likely incident is a ruptured unloading hose from a highway tanker truck.  As an alternate scenario, the ruptured hose from a \"pull away\" accident or a horizontal split of the hose casing (due to age) would cause a pool, which could ignite creating a pool fire.  The amount discharged before the source could be shut off would be about 2,050 lbs. a minute for about 5 minutes.

During this time period, the facility Emergency Brigade is populated and equipped to respond to an emergency involving pentane.  Flammable liquid firefigting and Hazardous Materiald Incident Management and Mitigation is part of the ongoing training of this team.\n\nF)  FIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nThis facility has not had a pentane accident in the past five years.\n\nG)  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe CRYOVAC Reading facility believes in the prevention of a spill release and has installed an unloading facility to assist in accomplishing this goal along with a selected group of \"A\" level mechanics who are specially trained per the pentane unloading procedure to offload these tankers.  CRYOVAC does however believe that the unexpected can happen and therefore has taken several positive steps to suppress/mitigate a fire and/or spill should it occur, regardless of the remoteness of the possibility.  To insure the immediate suppression of a fire that could impact the tanker vessel, an A.F.F.F. firefighting foam system is installed over, under, and around the tanker truck or car and is heat activated.  The facility has a well-trained and motivated in-house response team and members of the team occupy the facility on a continuous basis, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year.  The team tri-annually practices of flammable liquid firefighting and flammable gas firefighting on large demonstration fires at the Berks County Fire Traing Site, Reading, Pa.\n\nThe team has several documents that guide its actions during the emergencies that would involve pentane.  The material and the process fall under the RMP regulations, the stormwater regulations, RCRA PPC plans (preplans) and under the Clean Water Act with emphasis on \"Slug unloading prevention of sanitary sewers\".  All preplans have been sent to the local fire department who also visit or respond to the facility.  The particulars of the character of the pentane have"
