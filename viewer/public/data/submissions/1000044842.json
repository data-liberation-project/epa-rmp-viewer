      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been developed and implemented at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in an effort to protect human health, to protect the environment and comply with applicable federal regulations.  This plant is operated by the City of Athens employees and owned by the Athens Municipal Water Authority (AMWA). The water treatment plant has a capacity to process 8.0 million gallons per day. The plant physical address is 4663 FM 2892, Athens, Henderson County, Texas.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  These regulations were promulgated by the EPA to cover the accidental release prevention provision under the Clean Air Act 112(r)(7).  These regulations require facilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to develop a RMP.  The goal of a RMP is to focus on reducing the risk of accidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees as well as potentially catastrophic impacts on the public.  \n\n\n\nEntrance to the WTP is controlled by fencing and locked gates.  The plant is located in a semi-remote area.  The plant is out of town but not out of the populace.  The WTP utilizes chlorine gas in its treatment process.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the WTP does not exceed the published threshold quantity as illustrated in Table 2 of 40 CFR Ch. 1 (7/1/98 edition) Part A? 68.130 A? List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention.  Table 2 illustrates the threshold quantity to be 10,000 lbs.  The AMWA WTP stores 5,172 lbs on site.  The one ton containers of chlorine gas are stored within are ASME coded vessels.  During the design and construction of this plant, the engineers used guidelines set forth by the National Chlorine Institute.  All external piping is protected from accidental damage by channel iron.  The feed equipment is inspected daily.  All personnel that work inside "

Each employee is required to attend a class on how to read and interpret a Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) within their first six months of service.  As a first responder each has been trained in the proper procedure to shut down the chemical feed systems, or report to the emergency response personnel.  The Athens Fire Department is responsible for writing all emergency response procedures, and coordinate all emergency responses.  A copy of the City of Athens emergency response program has been filed with the Henderson County emergency response coordinators office and is attached to the Risk Management Program document.   \n\n\n\nAll plant operators are required to know the locations of the emergency telephone numbers and names of individuals to contact in case of a release.  If an emergency occurs, each employee will have an assigned task.  This risk management program enhances the safety plan already in operation because it provides a clear checklist that identifies predetermined individuals and agencies that require notification and coordination.  This RMP details which individuals will respond to the release to stop it and outline the agencies responsible for evacuating appropriate areas, and for sounding the \"all clear\" once the leak is contained.  The plan also includes procedures for periodic review of readiness.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to maintain the plant's level of safety and retain a record verifying the proper training for Water Treatment Plant employees/operators.\n\n    \n\nProgram Level Determination\n\n\n\nThere are currently three program levels.

Facilities that fall into Program Level 3 are subject to OSHA regulations, exceed a threshold quantity and have potential off-site consequence or the industry has one of the specified Standard Industrial classification (SIC) codes.  Currently, municipalities are not subject to federal OSHA regulations, and Texas does not have a state OSHA equivalent.  The off-site consequence analysis (Reference Section 3) indicates that there could be off-site consequences if a chemical release of chlorine  occurred at the AMWA Water Treatment Plant; therefore, the facility falls in Program Level 2.\n\n\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\n\n\nThe regulations outline five specific requirements for Program Level 2 facilities.  By June 21, 1999, each facility covered under the Risk Management Program rule must have completed and submitted to the EPA a Risk Management Plan.  The EPA has requested that all submittals be transmitted electronically on their forms with appropriate figures or maps.  For reference, a copy of the form has been included within Section B- Hazard Assessment.  A facility in Program Level 2 must conduct a hazard analysis, develop a prevention plan, implement an emergency response plan, and report any chemical accidents that have occurred the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe AMWA WTP Risk Management Program Level 2 includes the following requirements:\n\n    \n\n    40 CFR A? 68.48   Safety Information \n\n    40 CFR A? 68.50   Hazard Review\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.52   Operating Procedures\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.54   Training \n\n    40 CFR A? 68.56   Maintenance\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.58   Compliance Audits\n\n    40 CFR A? 68.60   Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nToxicology/Physical Properties\n\n\n\nIt is imperative that employees/operators are informed about the physical properties and potential health hazards of the chemicals located at the facility.

In addition, chemical interaction information should be made available to all employees as well.\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nChlorine is listed and regulated as an extremely hazardous chemical under Section 304 and can cause severe injury or death.  Chlorine is delivered to the WTP as liquefied compressed gas.  Chlorine gas is not explosive or flammable; however, it may support combustion.  It is a strong oxidizer and may react violently with substances such as water, ammonia, fuel oil, etc.  Chlorine gas is more dense than air  (vapor density= 2.49) and tends to settle in low areas.  It has a greenish-yellow color, and a strong pungent irritating odor with an odor threshold of approximately 3.5 ppm.  At standard temperature and pressure 1 ppm chlorine is equal to 2.76 milligrams per cubic meter in air.\n\n\n\nThe primary health hazard from chlorine exposure is damage to the respiratory system. It can also irritate the mucous membranes and targets the eyes, and skin.  In extreme cases, death by suffocation can result.  Frostbite may also occur if direct contact is made with liquefied chlorine.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) lists 10-ppm chlorine in air as immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH).  NIOSH recommends a ceiling value of 0.5 ppm chlorine in air while OSHA regulations list 1.0-ppm chlorine in air as the ceiling value.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe EPA requires chemical stored that exceeds the threshold quantity, a \"worst case\" scenario should be performed to determine the off-site consequence of accidental release.  The EPA defines the \"worst case\" scenario as follows: The largest single vessel, container or pipe that contains the chemical \n\nof concern releases the entire contents as a gas when full during a ten \n\nminute time period.\n\n    \n\nThe definition also assumes th"

The off-site consequence analysis was conducted in accordance with Chapter 4: Off-Site Consequence Analysis of the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs October 27, 1998.  The off-site consequence analysis was reviewed on April 13, 2010 due to lapse of anniversary date for re-submitting RMP.\n\n\n\nThe end point concentrations used in the model were based on the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.22.

Emergency Plan (CHLOREP) through CHEMTREC in the United States is (800) 424-9300.  CHEMTREC is typically used to provide assistance in emergencies involving the transportation of chlorine; however, they can provide information and assistance to on-site emergencies, as well.  They will have a listing of the locations of all chlorine emergency response kits available at the plant if proper registration was done when the kits were delivered.\n\n\n\nIf a leak occurs, it shall be necessary to contact local authorities to assist with evacuation.  In some instances, depending on whether there has been a \"reportable quantity\" leaked; governmental agencies must be contacted for chlorine emissions.  If an evacuation is necessary, then potentially exposed persons should move to a point upwind of the leak since chlorine is heavier than air.  If evacuation seems impractical, all air conditioners and air intake systems should be turned off; and individuals should retreat to the highest point of the building on the side awa"

When a person is outdoors, and they do not have respiratory protection, they should cover their mouth and nose with a wet handkerchief or cloth to reduce the effects of the exposure.\n\n\n\nPersonal protection equipment should be available outside of chlorine rooms, near each use point, away from areas that are likely subject to contamination.  Respiratory equipment should be selected based on evaluation of hazards and the degree of potential exposure.  Canister gas masks (for protection up to 25 ppm, maximum) or chemical cartridge respirators (up to 10 ppm) would offer adequate protection where the oxygen content in the air is greater than 19.5%.  If there is no monitoring equipment available to sample the air in the area of the leak, then use of a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a full-face piece is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nEmployee Training\n\nThe employees/operators maintain an emergency chlorine spill response kit on-site.  At a minimum, the on-site supervisor and designated assistant shall be properly trained in the use of chlorine, its dangers, and the proper use of the spill response kits.  All on-site personnel involved in the water treatment process shall be trained in the use and dangers of chlorine.

If the stored quantity of chlorine changes, the plan should be modified at that time. If a release occurs at the facility, an investigation should be conducted immediately in order to determine the reason for the release so that steps can be taken to prevent future incidents.  The RMP submittal to the EPA should be updated immediately following any inventory change.  If any other chemical is added to the system, a review should be conducted to determine if it is subject to the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nTraining Personnel\n\nAs part of the preventive maintenance and safety program, an annual refresher-training course should be conducted by supervisory personnel.  The training should include a refresher of the RMP, which includes the safety program, prevention program, and emergency response program.  As part of the safety program, a review of chemical hazards, use and maintenance of the safety equipment and use of the emergency repair and spill response kits should be completed.  In addition, those individuals assigned to a respirator should be fit tested.  The person conducting the training should be familiar with the use and hazards of chlorine, be up to date on current OSHA regulations, and knowledgeable in the use of personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nReporting\n\nChlorine and ammonia are subject to release reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA), and the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
