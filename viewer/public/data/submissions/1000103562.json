However, the City of Beeville, TX has full legal responsibility for the plant including the authority to make all policy and procedure decisions for this facility.  \n\nThe City of Beeville, TX has contracted day to day operations and maintenance to Inframark.  All decisions concerning the Risk Management Program for this facility shall be made by the City of Beeville, TX or their duly appointed liaison with input from the Inframark RMP Manager and on-site operations personnel. \n\n1.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAlthough there are no active or passive mitigation systems in place at this facility which could limit the effects of an accidental chemical release, the plant employs a number of different programs and policies to prevent an accidental release.  These are detailed in the various sections of the RMP manual but include the following:\n\nSafety Information\nSafety information for the chlorine system must be maintained as part of this prevention program. The Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for chlorine is included. The SDSs provide information about the regulated substance including chemical characteristics, reactivity data, physical hazards, toxicity hazards, exposure limits, thermal and chemical stability, corrosive data, precautions for safe handling and emergency and first aid procedures. An understanding of the characteristics of chlorine is essential to ensuring safe handling of these toxic substances.  Other pertinent safety information for chlorine can be found in the plan. \n\nSpecifications for the chlorine system components include the crane system. The specifications also include material and design information on the vessels, piping and process equipment used for chlorine storage and distribution at the facility. \n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures which give instructions for safely conducting activities for each phase of oper"

The training program must include either hands-on or classroom instruction and appropriate competency testing. Training covers, at a minimum, the connecting and disconnecting of cylinders, including visual inspections and the use of tools, and operation of cylinder handling equipment. All operations personnel responsible for the PLANT must have refresher-training at least annually.\n\nThe training program will include:\n?\tRisk Management Program\n?\tCl2 Equipment and Process Safety\n?\tCl2 Operating Procedures\n?\tCl2 Maintenance Procedures\n?\tEmergency Response Program\n?\tGeneral Safety \n\nMechanical Integrity Program\nPreventative maintenance, inspection and testing of equipment are critical to safe operations, including crane and hoist system and scales. Preventative maintenance includes written procedures and schedules of maintenance, safety training of equipment operators and inspection of equipment per manufactures recommendations.  \n\n2.0\tSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe plant is located in Mathis, TX and utilizes chlorine. Chlorine is used for disinfection before discharge.  The plant has the capacity to store approximately 12,000 pounds (lbs.) of chlorine on-site at any one time. The chlorine at the facility is contained in -ton containers that are on a standby/on-line basis to ensure the chlorination process is continuous. Chlorine is drawn from the 1-ton containers in a gaseous state.\n\n3.0\tREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe following table lists the regulated substances subject to the Risk Management Plan requirements for the plant including the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numb"

The worst-case release quantity of a regulated substance is defined in 40 CFR \u00a768 as the greatest amount held in a single vessel or in a pipe. Therefore, at the PLANT the worst-case release quantity, as defined by the EPA, is considered to be one (1) - 2,000-pound cylinder of chlorine (Cl2).  Worst case scenario and off-site consequences analysis are included in the plan.\n\nToxic Endpoint\nA toxic endpoint is defined as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or sym"

The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a single vessel would be released over a period of 10 minutes. For a 2,000-pound vessel, this calculates to a release rate of 200-lb/min. Other factors are taken into consideration in the determination of a toxic endpoint, including the terrain of the surrounding area (rural or urban), typical weather conditions and chemical density. The following factors were used in \u00b7the calculation of the toxic endpoint for this facility: Wind speed 1.5 m/s; Atmospheric Stability Class F; Temperature 25\u00b0; Humidity 50%; Urban Surface Roughness; Height of release 0-feet (ground level). For wastewater treatment plants, chlorine is always assumed to be dense gases which travel close to the ground surface. An urban surface roughness was chosen because there are many obstacles in the path of potential release, including trees and structures.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the plant was developed using the EPA\u0092s screening tool RMP*COMP, and the distance to a toxic endpoint for chlorine in an urban area is  1.3 miles at a release rate of 200-lb/min. A map showing the toxic endpoint radius around the plant is included in the plan.\n\n\n6.0\tOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \u0096 ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nAlternative release scenarios have been developed for the plant. According to EPA requirements, an alternative scenario must be developed for each toxic substance held above the threshold quantity for a facility with multiple toxic substances on-site.\n\nThe EPA guidelines require evaluation of potential various scenarios that may be more realistic in occurring at the plant as an alternative scenario.

There have not been any offsite release incidents at the which could be referenced as an alternative scenario. Therefore, default conditions as suggested by the EPA Risk Management Plan guidelines were used to determine the alternative release scenarios for chlorine. The EPA default weather conditions for the alternative release scenarios differ slightly from those used in the worst-case scenario analysis. The alternative scenario uses an atmospheric stability class D and a wind speed of 3 m/s.\n\nAlternative case scenario and off-site consequences analysis are included in the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Chlorine\nFor the plant alternative chlorine release scenario, it is assumed that a release from \u00bc inch hole in liquid phase of the tank caused by mishandling storage vessel.

The Project Manager called the LEPC of Live Oak County, emergency team.  They suited up used a Bkit and closed the valve.  According to the scales, the tank lost only 10 lbs.  The area in which the chlorine 1-ton tanks are stored is a covered building with no side walls.  There is no one living in this area according to the Marplot maps for at least 0.3 miles.  No one was injured in this incident.  Live Oak County did an onsite investigation while at the site.  Inframark did a follow-up with notes and statements.  This incident was called in immediately to National Response Center, a call came from the EPA located in Dallas, and then a call from TCEQ Emergency Response Coordinator.  ID # 1298467 provided by the NCR Representative.\n\nAn incident investigation will be completed and prepared for each accidental release that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted, in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The incident investigation report must be retained for a period of five years following the incident. A catastrophic release is classified as having caused at least one of the following:\n\n\u0095\tOn"

Additionally, the RMP Manager must make all required notifications for an accidental spill. The RMP Manager must maintain copies of all incident investigation documents at the plant.\n\n8.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program (ERP) is an important element of the Inframark RMP program.   The purpose of the ERP is to ensure that proper preparation, response, recovery, and consequence mitigation procedures are in place for accidental releases of chlorine resulting from natural disaster, human error, equipment failure, or sabotage.  The goals of this program include the following:\n?\tProtect the public\u0092s health and the environment.\n?\tProtect the health of facility staff and contract employees.\n?\tProtect the health of local emergency response agency personnel.\n?\tCoordinate emergency response actions between the local emergency response agencies and facility staff.\n?\tProvide emergency response procedures to be followed by facility personnel during emergency situations.\n\nThere are no facilities employees designated or qualified to respond to an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance; therefore, the plant would be considered a non-responding facility by EPA standards. An incidental release which does not cause a potential safety or health hazard or that can be neutralized or controlled at the time of release by an on-site operator would not be considered an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. An Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility to address incidental releases. \n\nThe chlorine storage area is monitored by vapor detection units, which notify the facility operations company by auto-di"
