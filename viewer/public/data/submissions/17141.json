This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas.  The Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the plant, is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a propane product.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for the WCS is 0.62 mile.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a product line (28,000 lbs released in 15 minutes).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.17 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use on emergency planning and response.  \n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant does not process or store toxic regulated substances ex"

Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA\u0012s) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0012s (OSHA\u0012s) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiates include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assign"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant uses the What-If/Checklist analysis t"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually c"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Hugoton Jayhawk Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
