Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the production of ammoniated liquid micronutrients for distribution as a crop production nutrient.  The end products are packaged and most are shipped to warehouses where they are sold to end users.  Aqua ammonia (29.5% ammonia solution - 24.3% nitrogen) is received and stored at the facility and is used for blending into other liquid fertilizer mixtures.  A scrubber is located on the liquid mixer.  The maximum stored quantity of aqua ammonia at the facility can be approximately 10,000 gallons (75,300 pounds) stored in one 10,000 gallon storage tank.  The tank can be filled to 100% full, but rarely is filled more than 90% full, which is measured by a liquid level gauge (site glass).  Aqua ammonia is delivered to the facility only in transport trucks; railroad cars are not used.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia stored at the facility would occur when the stationary storage tank is full and would be approximately 75,300 p"

The handling and storage of the aqua ammonia is subject to Program 2 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program.    \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 10,000 gallon storage tank within the fiberglass secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia (29.5% ammonia solution) released would be approximately 75,300 pounds of solution released as liquid with approximately 22,214 pounds of ammonia (75,300 pounds x 29.5%) being released as a vapor (i.e., evaporating) from the solution over 74.5 minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.42 miles, which is limited by the size of the fiberglass secondary containment structure (however, the result was obtained using an averaging time of 10 minutes).  There were no administrative controls considered in this scenario.  There was one passive mitigation measure considered in this scenario, which is, the size (approximately 380 square feet of surface area) of the fiberglass secondary containment.  The small size limits the spread (i.e., surface area or maximum pool area) of the ammonia solution and consequently the rate of evaporation and release of ammonia.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario involves a release of aqua ammonia from a pipe leak near the storage tank, but outside the fiberglass secondary containment structure.  The quantity of aqua ammonia (29.5% ammonia solution) released would be approximately 4,100 pounds of solution released as liquid with approximately 1,200 pounds of ammonia (4,100 pounds x 29.5%) being released as a vapor (i.e., evaporating)"

The active mitigation measure considered which may assist in limiting the release duration is listed in Section 3.16 and is manual shutting of valves.  There were no passive mitigation measures that affected this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program.  \n\n1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed, constructed and is operated in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the aqua ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility. \n\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of aqua ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  In addition, it is facility protocol to not store combustible material or to locate petroleum or propane storage tanks adjacent to the bulk aqua ammonia tank.   \n\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written op"

The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n4) Training:  All employees at the facility that handle aqua ammonia participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures followed by a verbal test) and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.  Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, State regulations or industry codes.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n6) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of aqua ammonia.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \n\n7) Incident Investigation:  Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of aqua ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no a"

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of aqua ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific aqua ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
