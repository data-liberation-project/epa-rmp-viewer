The facility has approximately 1057 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 as their accidental release prevention program.  The system is continuously monitored by a control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, ammonia detection.  A computer station is located in the refrigeration manager office.  The system is monitored and checked by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facilityA?s PSM program.  The system is visually inspected twice a day for proper operation.  System parameters are logged, as are routine maintenance activities.  Safe operation of the system will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures and providing appropriate training to employees.\n\nThis facility has developed and implemented a written Emergency Action Plan as defined in \n29 CFR 1910.38 as their emergency response program.  Emergency evacuation drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel quickly and safely evacuate the plant. This facility will utilize outside agencies and/or organizations to perform emergency response measures in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release.\n\nII.

The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards.  The major components of the ammonia system are located in the mechanical room or just outside in alleyway.  The system is a one stage refrigeration cycle. Support operations include a maintenance shop, parts area, and administrative offices.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is listed as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The operating capacity of each system exceeds this threshold.\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical A? Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facilityA?s PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facilityA?s plan.\n\nThe ammonia system is controlled and monitored 24/7 by the refrigeration personnel.  The system is equipped with fail safe devices, sensors, and pressure relief valves.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room and other area"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one recordable incident in the last five years that resulted in sending six employees for medical treatment for inhalation due to an ammonia release. The employees were sent to hospital to receive medical treatment for inhalation and then subsequently released.\n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies involving anhydrous ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.  All employees trained on ammonia awareness.\n\nThe facility has notified the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility's emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A copy has been given to local fire department.\n\nVI. Planned Changes \n\nA new compressor will be installed and completed 4-1-2011.  Pipe located in the engine room is being moved to the roof to take it out of forklift traffic.  The pipe relocation will be complete also on 4-1-2011.  \n\nAll previous safety plans have been implemented since the last submittal.  Facility plans has added a control system to increase monitoring and control of system from a central location.  Facility has added fourteen more ammonia sensors throughout the plant in addition to the existing 43 ammonia sensors. \n\n2 new rooms were added in 2010 and early 2011 with the second due to be completed 4-1-2011 causing a slight increase in ammonia requirements.
