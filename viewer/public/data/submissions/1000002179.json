      "SummaryText": "EPA RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTYSON FOODS BLOUNTSVILLE, AL \n\n1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices \nTo insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Blountsville, AL., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119. All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. To insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Blountsville, AL., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures. \n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled \n\nAt Blountsville, AL., we use anhydrous ammonia for our refrigeration system. The maximum inventory is 95,000 lbs. The plant's total ammonia inventory is shared between two interconnected ammonia systems located on the property. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario A? \n\nThe Blountsville, Alabama facility has an ammonia high pressure receiver as the single largest ammonia vessel.  The liquid-full capacity of the high pressure receiver is 923.2 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia condensing temperature of 95 degrees yields an approximate operating pressure of 181 psig and an ammonia liquid density of 36.71 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 923.2 cubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields the ammonia capacity of 33,882 pounds.  Using RMP Comp with the settings of ammonia liquefied under pressure, urban topography and no passive mitigation the distance to endpoint is 2.0 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario A? \n\nTyson Foods has chosen the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve activation.  Pressure relief valve activ"

      "SummaryText": "ations historically have been the primary release type within the company based on reports to Environmental Compliance and therefore considered more likely to result in a release than other events such as pipe or vessel failures.  The scenario chosen was based on a large pressure relief valve from the Engine Room # 1 Receiver.  This relief valve is not as likely to cause a release as a condenser relief valve but provides a scenario that creates a greater distance of concern than the pressure relief valves in use on the condensers (which have lower release rates).  This scenario will be useful in training and emergency planning. The pressure relief valve modeled for Blountsville is a Hansen H5604 with an inlet port size of 1-1/4A? and an outlet port size of 1-1/2A? and discharge flow rating of 116.1 pounds per minute (air rating) which converts to 90.70 pounds per minute ammonia at a pressure setting of 250 psig.  The typical release duration may not reach the property boundaries of most Tyson facilities, though EPA requires the alternative release scenarios to reach the boundary.  Tyson chose the release duration of 5 minutes in an urban setting to yield a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles which reaches and exceeds the property boundary at the Blountsville facility.  \n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program \n\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68. For ammonia systems Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance. Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators augmented by Tyson Standards and Specifications for design, construction and maintenance of refrigeration systems.  \n \n5.    Five-year accident history\n\nNo reportable accidents in past 5 years.\n \n6.    Th"

      "SummaryText": "e emergency response program\n\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site. This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q). The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident. A written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility. This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment. All Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q) (7) and (8). All BLOUNTSVILLE, AL. Hazmat Team Members are trained 24 hours initially to the Technician level followed by 8-24 hours of refresher training per year under the direction of the on-site Hazmat Instructor at the facility. Each Instructor receives an initial 40 hours of training and 8-16 hours per year re-certification training that goes to I.C. level. The training is designed to teach both theory and hands-on training giving the person an overall understanding of the nature of hazardous materials and the ability to assess and safely respond to the incidents in the Incident Command structure. \n\nTechnician level training includes but is not limited to the following:\n\nKnowledge of basic hazards and risk assessment techniques\nProper selection and use of appropriate and required PPE for the chemical hazard\nTerminology associated with Hazmat\nAdvanced site control/security procedures\nAdvanced Containment/Control/"

All training materials, hands-on drills and response procedures have been developed under the direction of the Corporate Loss Control Department. All Team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately. Supervisors and Leads are taught to report the above to the Safety or Process Manager immediately for further investigation and action by the Hazmat team. MSDS information books are accessible to all team members for review. \n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe Corporate Process Safety and Risk Management Program will be undergoing upgrades in the coming months in 2009 and 2010 that will result in streamlined and consistency driven approaches to management of hazardous chemicals covered by PSM and RMP at Tyson Foods.  This effort will result in enhanced understanding of programs and ease compliance with documentation systems through enhanced electronic tracking and record-keeping.\n"
