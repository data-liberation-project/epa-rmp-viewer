      "SummaryText": "GENERAL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR PROPANE STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITY\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe primary function of Gas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal is to act as a propane distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unncessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Safety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle propane as well as on the various safety devices incorporated into the design of our equipment.  Furthermore, comprehensive training received by our employees adds to the safety of our distribution facility.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook/Guidlines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures/ How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of propane, if a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the City of Westfield Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute propane to retail customers for use as a fuel.  Propane arrives at our facility via rail car and is stored in two (2) storage tanks.  This facility has equipment for unloading rail cars and transports and equipment to load transport trucks.  This facility does not load bobtails or containers.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized co"

The Flammable Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distance for Each Reported Scenario:\n\nWe have calculated the worst case release scenario based on EPA's RMP Comp (TM) method.  Incalculating the alternative release scenario analysis, we have also utilized the EPA's RMP Comp (TM) method.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  The worst case release scenario submitted for propane involves a catastrophic release from the storage tanks.  The scenario involves the release of 443,520 lbs. of propane.  The release quantity has been calculated with a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec, stability class: F, and an air temperature of 25 degrees C.  The estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is 0.60 miles.  The alternative release scenario involves a release from the rail tower header piping resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  In this scenario 1,995 lbs. of propane is released in one minute.  This release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include monitor fire nozzles, emergency shutdown valves and manual valves.  With a wind speed of 3 meters/second, stability Class: D, and an air temperature of 25 degress C., the estimated distance to lower flammability limit is .10 miles.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition / NFPA-70 Standard, 1999 Edition.\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information:\n\nGas"

The reviews focus on operating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify possible hazards.  Any finding related to the hazard reviews is addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of conducting safety activities within our covered processes, Gas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as emergency shutdown system/ startup procedures, per-operation visual inspection procedures, rail car unloading procedures, transport loading procedures and transport unloading procedures.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processess.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently and have passed a written proficiency test.  Refresher training is provided yearly.\n\nMaintenance:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in these practices.  Furthermore, personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of propane.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal is a new facility and has not had an accidental release.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - Westfield Terminal has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of propane.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Our facility's emergency response plan is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook/Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Response Procedures/How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
