Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Chem Gro Olds are committed to providing\n     a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  Health, safety\n     and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol\n     to adhere to applicable Federal, State, and local laws and to implement appropriate controls\n     to prevent accidental releasess of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release\n     were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is\n     prepared to work with the local fire department, The Local Emergency Planning Committee and\n     other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to\n     employees, the environment, and general public.\n\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct sale to farmers.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.  Anhydroous\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored in three storage tanks of 12,000 gal, 18,000 gal, and 12,000 gal.\n     These tanks are located in the Northwest corner of the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is also\n     stored in five-1450 gal wagons and eighty-1000 gal wagons.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous\n     ammonia would be 560,000 pounds.  Propane is stored in one 18,000 gal storage tank which is \n     located in the center of the facility.  The maximum quantity stored of propane would be 56,600\n     pounds.  The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total capacity, which is controlled\n     by a liquid level guage.\n\n3.      Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n          a.

The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per\n                   million, or ppm) is 2.1 miles.\n\n                   Propane- The maximum quanitity released would be 56,000 pounds.  The distance to the\n                   end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles.\n\n          b.      The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most\n                   likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\n                   Anhydrous Ammonia- The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a\n                   3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an\n                   automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The\n                   maximum quanitity released would be 26,600 pounds.  The distance to the\n                   endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n                   Propane- The alternate release scenario is a release from hose rupture caused by a\n                   pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active\n                   mitigation devices re assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the\n                   contents of the hose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The\n                   distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n\n\n\n4.

The reviews identify the opportuntiy\n         for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards\n         used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.\n         The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n         3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written procedures for the handling and storage of\n         anhydrous ammonia and propane.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the \n         Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFRn1910.111,\"Storage and\n         Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
