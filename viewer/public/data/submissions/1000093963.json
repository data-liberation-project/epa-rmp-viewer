In January, 2024, the facility experienced a release of material within containment that met the criteria for on-site impacts at 40 CFR Part 68.42(a). Details of the accident are provided in Section 6 of this RMP.\n\n(e) Nova has developed and implemented an emergency response plan under the Program Level 3 RMP requirements. The Emergency Response Plan provides detailed response, notification, reporting, and evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency situation at the facility and consists of the main elements of the RMP Emergency Response Plan requirements.  Emergency response training includes: notification of appropriate personnel (company and off-site responders); hazardous material identification; release assessment; control procedures; prevention of recurrence or spread of fires/releases; and incident clean-up. The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment).  The Sumter County Emergency Management Office, Sumter Fire Department, City of Sumter Police Department, Sumter County Sheriff's Department, and Prisma Health Tuomey Hospital are part of the emergency response plan for the facility and have been provided copies of the facility's contingency plan. \n\nFacility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and releases.

Chemicals are generally received by, and shipped from, the facility via tank truck, box truck, and railcar.\n\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of its employees and neighboring community. Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's emergency response plan. Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measures (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of recovered materials in the event of a release. Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and spills.  However, the Sumter Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of a release beyond the incipient stage.\n\n(b) The facility consists of a chemical tank farm and drum processing building. The Tank Farm consists of twenty six above-ground storage tanks ranging in capacity from 10,000 to 30,000 gallons.  The regulated substance potentially handled above their regulated threshold levels in the Tank Farm process is hydrogen cyanide at 1.5% of a solvent solution. No regulated substances are managed above their threshold levels in the drum processing building.\n\n(c) The facility has determined that it is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulations and is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standards at 29 CFR Part 1910.119. As such, Nova has implemented a Level 3 Prevention Program required at 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D.  The objective of the accident prevention program is to develop a proactive approach to the identification, evaluation, and prevention of chemical releases. Nova strives to meet these objectives through the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs. The key elements of these programs are: \n\n1. Employee participation\n2. Process safety informa"
