Our ammonia tank is a 131,000lb tank with associated piping, vents, and relief valves, check valves, excess flow device and manual shut off. We also have 20 nurse tanks that are also maintained and are included in the RMP Oty(lbs) calculations.\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of a 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to the EPA lookup tables the end point is 4.4 miles there is schools, residences, business and state parks within the distance to the end point, with a total population 935 people.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario is a release of 2,900 lbs for a period of 2min. in duration. According to the EPA lookup tables the end point for this type of a release is .03 miles.\n\n\n\nAdministrative Controls\n\nWe fill our tank to 85% capacity as an administrative control.\n\n\n\nThe general accident release prevention program and the chemical- specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
