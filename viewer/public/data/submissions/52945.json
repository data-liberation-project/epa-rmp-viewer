The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Refrigeration grade anhydrous ammonia a regulated substance, is the chemical commonly used in industrial refrigeration systems to maintain low temperatures for storage.  Inherent properties of anhydrous ammonia make it the refrigerant of choice and widely accepted as being among the most efficient as well as being environmentally friendly, it can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility cold storage operations.  The refrigeration system in this facility contains approximately 63,500  pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.\n\n\n\nAmericold Management has implemented the requirements of the Risk Management Plan at this location in order to operate this facility in accordance with regulations and support of best industry standards.  The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility safety management has developed an Employee Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan along with emergency procedures and training to protect the employees, the public and the environment.  These safety fundamentals are based on, International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration,  Ammonia Safety and Training Institute, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and International Association of Refrigerated Warehouse guidance.   Americold employees responsible for managing the ammonia refrigeration process are provided first responder training by specialists that are authorized to train.  Americold management believes it is important that employees participate in emergency response planning with local responders in order to be adequately trained in handling emergency situations with "

In event any offensive response activity is required, trained Americold employees will assist if in a coordinated response under the authority of the local emergency management response unit.\n\nThe first responder training includes facility managers, refrigeration employees, and local emergency responders in order to protect life safety and the environment while providing a safe workplace.  Preventing accidental ammonia releases at Americold by following process safety management practices is an important part of daily operations.  PSM is the method to manage the ammonia refrigeration system properly.  This creates a safety culture to ensure the facility complies with OSHA, EPA, state, and local requirements, as well as its own internal standards.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\nAmericold is committed to safe management and operation of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.

Should any accidental release occur, all refrigeration employees are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental releases.\n\n\n\nAs part of Americolds safety programs, the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan is an integral part of our base safety manual.  The program covers the entire scope of safe work practices that are required for the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nNormal operations rely on the following:                                                              \n\nO The Mechanical Integrity portion "
