      "SummaryText": "of 2500 pounds.  The City of Frederick chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Maryland Department of Environmental Protection (MD DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored in 150 pound cylinders.  It is then distributed to several process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is non-flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling 15 minute permissible exposure limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with an immediately dangerous health hazards (IDLH).  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is forty-two (42) containers.  This equals 6,300 pounds.  The immediate dangerous health (IDLH) level is 10 ppm and a lethal concentration (LC-5O) of 250 ppm.\n3.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public and environment surrounding the plant.  For chlorine, the distance to the endpoint concentration of the gas was determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios a worst case and an alternative case.  The City maintains a five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system (see section 4 below: five year accident history).\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00c2\u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure."

      "SummaryText": "The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm.  The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00c2\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, to estimate the population potentially affected.\n3.1.\tWORST CASE   (C) (1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Comp air dispersion program.

This plant is one of four water plants operated by the City.  The City also operates one wastewater treatment plant.  The Monocacy water plant as well as the Lingamore water plant and the wastewater plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\nThe City of Frederick has a management system in place which is lead by the City\u00c2\u00bfs Mayor, who delegates implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements to the Public Works Department Director.  The Director delegates the RMP program to the Utilities Acting Deputy Director who has responsibility for water treatment plant operations and RMP Program implementation.  This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information."
