The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Thompson are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Little Dixie Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of dry bulk fertilizers and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.  The facility also handles pesticides, feed, seed, and farm supply products.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in each of our two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a railroad tank car holding approximately 162,563 pounds.  There may be occasions where multiple railroad tank cars would be located at the facility.\nThe facility has (32)-1,000 gallon nurse tanks therefore the facility total maximum storage capacity would be 744,238          pounds.\n  \n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The facility will move to the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n4.
