We send a copy of our Tier II Report to Yankton County LEPC. We also send a copy to the local fire department that serves us, which is the Tabor Fire Department. Usually, the head of the fire department and some of his associates come out on a yearly basis to look over our facility.  In our Tier II forms we list the location as to where all our chemicals are stored in our treatment plant.  Then, the Yankton County LEPC has a copy  and so does the local fire department.\r\n     B-Y Water District is a water treatment facility.  We treat water that is drawn out of the Missouri River. We add carbon to the water for taste and odor control.  We soften the water with lime.  We have a lime softening process where we add lime and sodium aluminate. We also add polymer and polyphosphate.  We add fluoride for dental purposes.  We filter it and then add chlorine & ammonia and send it out to the distribution system.\r\n     The employees at the B-Y Water also have on the job training here at the plant.  We have drills on how to put on the oxygen epuipment and we go through a list of things to do if we have an emergency.  We have written in a book on who to contact first and then down the line from there.   We followed a template the state gave us on Emergency Response Plan.\r\n     Chlorine is the only hazardous substance that we have on hand that is over the threshold limit.  B-Y Water can hold up to 8000 lbs. of chlorine at one time in our chlorine facility.  The chlorine facility is attached to our plant, but is enclosed and can only be entered from the outside.\r\n     B-Y Water has not had accident in the last five years.  We also have not had a chlorine release in the last five years.  The closest town to our facility is (6) miles away.  The nearest residence is (1) mile away from our plant.\r\n     B-Y Water District filled o"

We have a scada system in our plant that has an intrusion system on it..  We have two chlorine detectors, one of the detectors is tied ino the scada system.  In the futre we hope to tie in more alarms into our scada system.  We hope to attend more classes and plan to hold more hands on drills here at our treatment facility.  The emergency response template,that the state gave us is filled out so we know what we are going to do in different situations. This sums up how we handle things at our treatment plant."
