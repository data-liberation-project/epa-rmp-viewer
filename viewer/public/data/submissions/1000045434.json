Presently on average, the wastewater treatment plant processes seven and one half million gallons per day.  The plant utilizes an activated sludge sewage treatment process and operates 24 hours per day.  There are 24 employees onsite at various times during normal business hours.  At night and during irregular work hours, two employees are always on duty at the facility.  A maximum of 18 tons of chlorine gas (Cl2) in one ton containers is stored onsite with six containers being connected and online at any one time.  The plant also has a maximum of ten tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in one ton containers stored onsite with two containers being connected and online at any one time.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Information\r\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific set of critieria required to be used in the modeling of worst case and most probable case release scenarios.  Worst case and most probable case scenario modeling was completed using EPA RMP*Comp software.\r\n\r\nTo complete most probable and worst case scenario plume models, the default level of concern for chlorine and sulfur dioxide was set at levels established in EPA and American Industrial Hygiene Association guidance.  The resulting plume indicates a level where individuals would be able to take protective actions without suffering any serious health effects from a chemical exposure during a one hour or less period.  Most probable case and worst case scenario plume analysis results are conservative estimates based on the ALOHA software, using RMP release and meterological requirements.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program Information\r\nThe Hollywood Road Wastewater Treatment Plant processes seven and one hal"
