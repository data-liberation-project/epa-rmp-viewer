The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant is\ncoordinated with Garfield County LEPC. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings,\nwhich includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives. The Parachute\nCreek Gas Conditioning Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the Garfield County\nLEPC. The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Garfield County LEPC and\nemergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Parachute Creek Plant plans to\nevaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."

The program includes OTJ training. Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n- Management of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to\nmanage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the\nchange.\n- Incident Investigation: The goal of each investigation is to determine that facts concerning an\nincident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n- Compliance audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in\ncompliance with applicable RMP/PSM/WIMS procedures and regulations.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThe Parachute Creek Gas Plant has not had"

The NGL stream is stored onsite in pressurized storage tanks prior to being trucked offsite for sale.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Parachute Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk\nManagement Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM)\nprogram. The Parachute Creek Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented all the elements of\nWilliams Information Management Plan (WIMS), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safet"

It\nincludes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually. \n\nWilliams CEO, Alan Armstrong, has supported the commitment to safety in saying, While each [of Williams Core Values & Beliefs] are important, our commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship is critical, reminding us that Williams is committed to the health and safety of our work force and to the protection of our neighbors, the environment, and our assets. \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Parachute Gas Conditioning Plant is a natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction facility that processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and NGL. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The PCGP is designed to process 700 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas.\n\nThe purpose of the PCGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and\nnatural gas condensate liquid. To complete this separation, the inlet field gas is chilled using a\npropane refrigeration system. This process causes the NGL to condense out of the chilled gas\nstream. As the gas is chilled, ethylene glycol is injected into the filed gas to absorb water. Ethylene glycol,"
