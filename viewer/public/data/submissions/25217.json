      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe El Paso Field Services, L.P. (El Paso Field Services) Pelican Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The El Paso Field Services policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n    SUBSTANCES\n\nEl Paso Field Services owns and operates the Pelican Gas Plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. The Pelican Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that removes liquefiable hydrocarbons from a natural gas stream by cryogenic gas cooling and liquid separation.\n\nThe Pelican Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, El Paso Field Services identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Pelican Gas Plant are raw make, natural gas and condensate.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Pelican Gas Plant is subject to OSHA PSM. Therefore, the Pelican Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the ex"

Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  Condensate is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.62-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but not likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for raw make as follows.  A pipe rupture of the line from the product storage vessel to the product pumps causes a one inch hole in the 8 inch pipe.  The release is assumed to continue for 15 minutes.  The raw make will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL).  The alternative-case release of raw make resulted in a 0.13-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint and less than 0.06 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Pelican Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Pelican Gas Plant.  Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement i"

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Pelican Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include a Health Safety & Environmental Team (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, Behavioral Based Safety Programs and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Pelican Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conducts all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).
