      "SummaryText": "The CJ Bio America Facility is currently under construction in Fort Dodge, Iowa. The facility is located in Webster County. The anticipated start up for the facility is October 1, 2013. Since this RMP is being submitted well in advance of facility start up, there are some elements of the risk management program which are still under development. It is the intent of the facility to submit an updated RMP upon complete implementation of the Risk Management Program in advance of facility start up. The discussion below addresses the current status of each element of the risk management program\n\n\n\n5 YEAR RELEASE HISTORY\n\nAs stated above, this facility is under construction and has yet to receive any materials therefore there is no release history. \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe facility has drafted an employee participation program and this program will be reviewed prior to facility start up. \n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nProcess safety information is being compiled as the facility construction progresses. Since the facility construction is still underway, this material is still subject to change based on process design changes and the implementation of recommendations from the PHA. It is the facilities intent to maintain all PSI in a central location and all safety information will be assembled and reviewed prior to facility start up. \n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe facility conducted a Process Hazard Assessment on December 13,2012. The PHA utilized a combination of the HAZOP methodology and checklists. The HAZOP focused on hazards related to the process, while the checklists focused on environmental factors, human factors and facility siting. The facility has been addressing recommendations and all recommendations from the PAH will be addressed prior to the facility start up in October. \n\n\n\nSTANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nStandard Operating Procedures are still under development, as the facility is still under construction. As SOPs are developed, they are being rev"

SOPs will be certified on an annual basis once the facility begins operation. Operators will be involved with the annual certification. \n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nKey facility employees have been hired and have been undergoing extensive operations training. This training has involved prolonged visits to existing CJ facilities that are currently in operation in other countries. The training involves a combination of hands on training and classroom training. All training activities are being documented. A training program for employees hired after operation commences is currently under development. \n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nThe facility will be utilizing the computerized maintenance management module in SAP to manage its mechanical integrity program. That system, is still in development. The system will be utilized to generate work orders for preventative maintenance activities based on manufacturer's recommendations. The frequency of the work orders will follow manufacturer's recommendations and all maintenance activities will be performed according to the procedures specified by the manufacturer. In addition any non-routing maintenance will be tracked in the SAP system so that a complete maintenance history can be ound for each piece of equipment. Since the maintenance program is still being developed at this time, no date has been provided for the review of maintenance procedures or maintenance activities. \n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nSince this is a new facility, there will be extensive commissioning and testing of equipment prior to the introduction of hazardous materials. This testing includes the verification that the equipment received meets is indeed the specified equipment and that all equipment is installed in accordance with design specifications. In addition to the engineering testing, there will be an addit"

Since the PSSR is still underway, no date has been provided in this submission. \n\n\n\nAUDITS\n\nA written audit program has been developed for the facility in which compliance audits will be conducted at least every three years. Since this is a new facility there have been no compliance audits conducted to date. \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nAn incident investigation procedure has been developed and all employees will be trained in the procedure prior to commencing operations. Since no hazardous material has been received on site, there have been no incidents which resulted in or could have resulted in catastrophic release to investigate; therefore there is no date provided for the most recent investigation.\n\n\n\nHOT WORK\n\nThe facility ahs develop a detailed hot work program. Employees will be trained on the hit work program, prior to commencement of operation. \n\n\n\nCONTRACTOR SAFETY\n\nThe facility has developed a contractor safety program that will be implemented upon commencement of operation. During construction the Engineering contractor that is overseeing the construction of the facility has been managing all contractors on site. \n\n"
