The facility also produces animal feeds such as wet distillers grain, distillers syrup and distillers corn oil as a byproduct of ethanol production.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nAqueous ammonia (24%) is stored on-site in liquid form and used in the ethanol production process for pH control of the corn and water solution to maintain the effectiveness of enzymes used to break the corn starch down into sugars. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored the facility is 34,200 gallons or 275,000 pounds. The ammonia tank is located in a concrete containment structure. Natural Gasoline (Denaturant) is stored on-site in liquid form and blended at <5% with ethyl alcohol prior to shipping to render the alcohol undrinkable according to ATF regulations.  Denaturant used by the facility can contain pentane and isopentane in varying percentages above 10,000 pounds each, the off-site consequence analysis was conducted using data from a certificate of analysis by a 3rd party laboratory. The maximum amount of denaturant (flammable mixture) on-site is estimated to be approximately 58,750 gallons or 321,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank inside a concrete containment structure. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAlto Magic Valley, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  It is the policy of Alto  Magic Valley, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Alto Magic Valley, LLC to notify the local fire department and the Cassia County Sheriff Department and implement em"

The Process Safety program is also the RMP Prevention Program.  Through the completion of this RMP, Alto Magic Valley, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations, maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nAlto Magic Valley, LLC has not had any accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The facility started operations in spring of 2008.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nAlto Magic Valley, LLC has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored and used at the facility.  The facility has a written Integrated Contingency Plan, conducts regular drills as well as employee training on the procedures.  These efforts have been coordinated with state and federal regulating agencies and local responders.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAlto Magic Valley, LLC recently completed a process hazard analysis and a compliance audit. A plan is ongoing for resolving recommendations and findings to improve safety and compliance.   The facility is also working on a plan to reduce the concentration of aqueous ammonia or eliminate it altogether.   Alto Magic Valley, LLC will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training,"
