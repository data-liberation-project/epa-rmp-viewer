Hunt, Owner\nPhone:    641-847-2402\n\n1. FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management and personnel of J.M. Hunt & Son, Inc., Ackley, Iowa (the facility), are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and handling of fertilizers for sale to area farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application on farms for crop production nutrients. It is stored in:  one (1) - 12,000 gallon tank; two (2) - 6,000 gallons tanks; three (3) - 1,500 gallon nurse tanks and 22 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum total amount stored would be about 221,065 pounds.\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:  A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank (26,000 gallons), about 52,530 pounds at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion of ammonia in the atmosphere to 200 parts per million, ppm) is estimated to be about 2.6 miles.  B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the five year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose over a period of two (2) minutes or until an automatic or manual shut-off valve is activated. The distance to the end point for this Scenario is estimated to be about 0.7 miles.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  the facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Insti"

      "SummaryText": "tute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The facility has:  A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
