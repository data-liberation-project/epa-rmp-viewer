      "SummaryText": "                  HUCKABAY RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n                        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\nand contain the release.\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant, located 4 miles north of FM 219 near Huckabay in Erath County, Texas,\nproduces natural gas liquids from natural gas. These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of\nethane, propane and butane. The plant also treats natural gas liquids to remove CO2. Some of the\nchemicals produced or used include methane, ethane, propane, butane, and diethanolamine.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Huckabay gas plant above the EPA Threshold\nQuantity. The threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical\nwhich if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program\nregulations. Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold\nquantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane and butane.\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 30,000 gallon storage tank containing natural\ngas liquids. Assuming the material in the tank is primarily propane, the distance away from the\nplant affected in this worst-case scenario would be approximately 0.42 miles, based on EPA\nanalysis. \n\nA more proba"

Based on the pump capacity of approximately 150 gallons/minutes\n(9000 gallons in one hour), we would release approximately 1500 gallons in 10 minutes, at which\ntime our operators or the truck driver would detect and isolate the leak. The affected distance\nbased on EPA guidance is approximately 0.15 miles, or approximately 780 feet.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based\non the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all chemicals\non-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all vessels\nand equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with written\nprocedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance\nactivities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety\nfeatures in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with\nthe various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined to\nidentify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\nwhat-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are\nconducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.\nThis team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and\nmitigation measures, and mak"

All approved recommendations from the\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\nappropriate, the Huckabay gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis\nresults. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations. These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\nas current and accurate.\n\n\nTraining\n\nOur employees at the Huckabay plant have an average experience of over 10 years. This level of\nexperience provides a great level of expertise throughout the facility. Ongoing training is\naccomplished through routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new processes and refresher\ntraining on operating procedures. \n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\nmaintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety and health\nhazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\nIn addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the\nselection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor performance to ensure\nthat contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our equipment\nin a safe operating condition.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that\nequipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment operates within acceptable limits. If\na deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back\nin service or they will determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the\nequipment.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has long-standing safe work practices to help ensure worker and process\nsafety. Examples of these include lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for\nequipment that is being worked on, a permit and procedure for hot work and a permit and\nprocedure for confined space entry. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected\npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed\nsafely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.\nThis system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\n(including operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and\nauthorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are\nin place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been\ncompromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary\ntraining on the change.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or\npersonal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective\nactions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Huckabay gas plant have hazards that must be managed to e"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention\nof accidental releases of specific regulated substances in the facility.\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n(2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of\nsafety features are used in the covered process\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1.    Hydrocarbon detection sensors within the facility.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.    Process relief valves to prevent vessel overpressure.\n2.    Valves (both manual and automatic) to permit isolation of the process.\n3.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (such as high pressure or\n      high level in a vessel).\n4.    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.    Fire extinguishing systems. We have numerous fire extinguishers of several sizes\n      throughout the facility. In gas plants, the control of fire is more dependent on restricting\n      sources of fuel than on putting out the fire.\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Huckabay plant has not had an incident over the past five years which has impacted off-site\npeople or structures.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Huckabay gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to\nprotect worker and public safety. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release,\nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical\ntreatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. \n\nIn addition, the Huckabay gas plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and\ntesting of emergency response equipment, as well a"
