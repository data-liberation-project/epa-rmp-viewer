This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\t\nIncident Investigation\n\t\nThe Thomas Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\t\nCompliance Audits\n\t\nTo help ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, the Thomas Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to"

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\t\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Thomas Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\t\nSafe Work Practices\n\t\nThe Thomas Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

In addition, the Thomas Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\t\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\t\nThe Thomas Gas Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\t\nTraining\n\t\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Thomas Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\t\nContractors\n\t\nThe Thomas Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\t\nPeriodically, the Thomas Gas Plant updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.
