Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs. Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include; personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes. Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE THOMAS GAS PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe Thomas Gas Plant, located approximately 2.5 miles west  of Thomas in Custer County, Oklahoma (23584 E 880 Road, Thomas, OK), operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Thomas Gas Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n    \n\n?    Product Storage Tank comprised of ethane-plus (NGL) mixture.\n\n    \n\nThis process vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regulated flammable substance that could hypothetically be released and ha"

In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP),  the Thomas Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Thomas Gas Plant is classified as a Program Level 1 facility.  Under Program Level 1 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing a mixture of regulated flammable substances.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 217,718 pounds (80% of the maximum tank capacity), which is the basis for the  for the Worst Case Scenario calculations.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.0.48 miles or 2,556 feet.  Additionally, we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences.\n\n    \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    \n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Thomas Gas Plant.  Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\nEmployee Participation\n\n    \n\nThe Thomas Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n    \n\nPeriodically, the Thomas Gas Plant updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features. These periodic revalidations/reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n    \n\nTraining\n\n    \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Thomas Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

In addition, the Thomas Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n    \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n    \n\nThe Thomas Gas Plant conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n    \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n    \n\nThe Thomas Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
