Risk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  1) The Facility Policy. The management and employees of Farmers Union Coop Oil Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people in the environment.  2)  Facility Information. -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  -Anhyrdous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application of crop production nutrients.  -The maximum quantity stored would be 78.795 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.  3)  The pre-prescribed release scenarios.  a.  The first pre-prescribed release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,795 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.1 miles.  The second pre-prescribed release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .36 miles.  4)  The accidental release prevention program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  5)  The Five-year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia"

The facility has a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38, b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.  7)  Planned changes to improve safety.  We are constantly striving to improve safety at our facility.  Periodically, evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions for our employees and neighbors.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this  time."
