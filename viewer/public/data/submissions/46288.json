              "Description": "\n \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION  \n\nThe Atlas Cold Storage Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems.  The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME,  Pressure Vessel Codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of construction.  In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency.  Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up to running and emergency shut-down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they  become emergencies.\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protection equipment in an emergency scenario.  The hazard analysis (\"what-if\") checklist helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safey and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases.  Lock-out/tag-out, and line opening procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures.  Coordinated emergency response planning is established with Montgomery County LEPC, and a written offsite emergency response plan is reviewed annually.",

The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Employee Emergency Action and Fire Prevention Plan.  Along with the emergency procedures and training, a plan is coordinated with local emergency responders to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, a fire or other emergency situation.  Atlas Cold Storage provides emergency response training for employees through the use of specialists in the industry that are authorized to train.  Atlas Cold Storage believes it is important that employees that participate in emergency response situations are adequately trained in handling emergency situations with anhydrous ammonia systems.  This specialized HAZMAT training follows the guidelines of federal, state and local regulatory agencies.\n\nThe management believes that cooperative emergency response training must include company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in order to provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all employees are trained to cooperate with other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response IncidentCommander.                                                                                                                                                             \nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at Atlas Cold Storage, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.

The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.  Ammonia, a regulated substance, is the commonly used refrigerant in industrial grade refrigeration systems that maintain low storage temperatures and can be safely managed by trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration process functions within a closed piping network serving the facility operations.  The refrigeration systems in this facility contains approximately 23,600  pounds of ammonia inventory for this process.  Two refrigeration systems operate in individual cold storage warehouses on the property.  Plant 2 has an ammonia charge of approximately 6100 pounds and Plant 3 has an ammonia charge of approximately 17,500.\n\n\nAtlas Cold Storage is committed to safe management and operation of the closed Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Maintenance employees are trained to observe operational procedures designed to be as fail-safe as possible to prevent accidental release of ammonia at any time.  Should any accidental release occur, all refrigeration employees are certified Emergency Hazardous Material Responders and are required to observe safe emergency response procedures.  They are trained to work in conjunction with the local Emergency Planning Commission to minimize the impact of any accidental releases.\n\nAs part of Atlas Cold Storage's safety programs, we have adopted the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan as required and is an integral part of our base safety manual.  The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potent"
