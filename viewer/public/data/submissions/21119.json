THE FACILITY HAS 2 TANKS (ONE 12,000 GALLON AND ONE 11,000 GALLON)  WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 101,000 POUNDS.  THE TANKS  ARE DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE  LOCAL, STAE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR TANKS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 53,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.63  MILES AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 276 AREA CITIZENS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELEASE NEARLY 11,000 POUNDS WITHIN 2 MINUTES AND WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES EFFECTING APPROXIMATELY 250 AREA PEOPLE.\n\n THIS COMPANY'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRAIN ITS EMPLOYEES IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON A REGULAR BASIS.   THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF THE TYPICAL FACILITY.  THE EMPLOYEEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  ABOVE ALL, THEY MAKE SURE TO HAVE CLEAN SAFETY WATER ON HAND DURING  AMMONIA OPERATIONS.   OUR SAFETY RECORD  ALLOWS US TO PROUDLY REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURY ACCIDENTS AT THIS PLANT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH OUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE LOCAL FIRE CHIEF IS AN EMPLOYEE OF THIS COMPANY.  THE MULLINVILLE  FIRE DEPARTMENT WILL BE OUR FIRST RESPONDER AND HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICE TO THIS COMPANY IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
