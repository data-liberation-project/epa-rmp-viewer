The facility has a training program, which includes both internal and external emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency release procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the North Lawrence Fire Department, the LEPC and OPTECH Environmental Services in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0\tProcess Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility produces blended yogurt and cottage cheese.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 31151.  The facility is also capable of packaging yogurt and cottage cheese products.  Several areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve food products.\n\nAmmonia is the only North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The quantity of ammonia presently stored on site is 18,500 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range concentration with a high ignition temperature.  Ammonia is not toxic, but can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns.  The potential risks of people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of the skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n3.0\tGeneral Accidental Release Pre"
