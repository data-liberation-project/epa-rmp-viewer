To fulfill these goals, we enroll in regulatory management service that assist in maintaining and administer comprehensive safety and enviromental programs,  procedures and training courses.  We preform a through annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and overseen assistance with this specific firm.  The program consists of internal audit utilizing checklists survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.

We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers and nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade liquid fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nOur facility maintains 29 - 1000 gallon nurse tanks and 4 - 1500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 35,000 gallons.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank (1@26,000 gallons) on site.  121160 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum capicity of stationary storage tank.  Therefore, the total facility of anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for this location is 284,260 pounds.  The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 121,160 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 26,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 121,160 pounds.  According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purpose of this plan is a two-minute release from the stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 300 pounds for a storage tank.  The di"

This facility complies with the ANSI case 61.1 standards (1989 edition), OSHA - 29 CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose to fill the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill lines breakaways to immediately stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia if a line or hose would fail.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.  Lighting for the facility has increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\n\nOur anhrdrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, guages, and relief valves are repleaced when necessary and according to the guidelines with the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees atleast annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations are questioned.  In accordance with the 1989 ANSI standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operation.

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours annually to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to ensure that our community has the stragety for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by ammonia release.
