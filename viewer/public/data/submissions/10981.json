These policies include: an emergency response sequence;\nemergency response to fires, explosions, and environmental releases; notification and reporting\nto regulatory agencies in the event of a reportable release; emergency response to hurricanes,\nfloods, and bomb threats; spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plan;\nidentification and training of an emergency response team; emergency coordinator and regulatory\ncall lists; emergency equipment list and location; sensitive materials storage list; material profiles\nand material safety data sheets for major raw materials on site. \n\nThere are eight substances at the PRP facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident\nPrevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR Part 68.  These substances are used in various\nprocesses throughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  Specifically, the facility\nproduces cationic polymers, polyamine, Mannich products, melamine formaldehyde acid colloid,\nand diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC).  Substances that are used by PRP that are\nregulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part 68 are as follows:\n\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n *   Anhydrous Ammonia: Anhydrous ammonia is used as a reactant in the polyamine\n     process.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored on-site is 88,000 pounds.\n\n *   Aqueous Ammonia: 30 percent ammonium hydroxide (aqueous ammonia) is used as a\n     reactant in the polyamine process.  The maximum amount of 30 percent ammonium\n     hydroxide (aqueous ammonia) stored on-site is 150,000 pounds (45,000 pounds pure ammonia).\n\n *   Epichlorohydri"

      "SummaryText": "n: Epichlorohydrin is used as a reactant in the polyamine process. The\n     maximum quantity stored on-site is 190,000 pounds.\n\n *   Ethylenediamine: Ethylenediamine is used as a reactant in the polyamine process. The\n     maximum quantity stored on-site is 45,000 pounds.\n\n *   Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in the Mannich process and in the\n     production of melamine formaldehyde acid colloid.  Formaldehyde is received and stored\n     as a 37 percent solution in water.  The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde\n     stored on-site is 90,000 pounds (33,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\n\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n *   Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is used in the DADMAC and polyamine processes as a\n     reactant.  It is also used to make Mannich polymers. Dimethylamine is received and\n     stored in anhydrous form. The maximum amount of anhydrous dimethylamine stored on-\n     site is approximately 120,000 pounds.\n\n *   Propane: Propane is used as fuel.  The maximum amount stored on-site is 120,000\n     pounds.\n\n\nWorst-case Scenarios:\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios\nwere evaluated and are discussed in this RMP.  As required, worst case scenarios are presented in\nthe RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternative scenarios were\nprepared for each of the toxic substances with worst case endpoints located offsite and for one\nflammable substance (propane).  The endpoint represents the distance at which a released\nsubstance must travel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not co"

The results of the worst case scenario analysis were as follows:\n\n *   Toxic Substances: The anhydrous ammonia storage tank was assumed to fail and\n     subsequently produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents.  The release\n     was assumed to occur over a 10-minute time period. No passive mitigation controls were\n     considered in limiting the release impacts.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was\n     estimated to be less than 2.4 miles.\n\n *   Flammable Substances: The propane storage tank was assumed to fail and subsequently\n     produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents that results in a vapor cloud\n     explosion.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the release\n     impacts.  The distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than 0.40 miles.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect public\nreceptors.  For anhydrous ammonia, epichlorohydrin, ethylenediamine, and formaldehyde,\nreleases were assumed to occur as a result of the uncoupling or rupture of a  transfer hose during unloading\noperations for each substance.  For flammable materials, the alternative release scenario assumed that\npropane was released as a result of the uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. The\ndurations for releasing these materials (except anhydrous ammonia) from a vessel/pipe for the alternative\nrelease scenarios were assumed to occur over a 1-minute time period.  Anhydrous ammonia was assumed to be\nreleased within a 15 second period since the delivery vessel is equipped with a high-flow shut-off valve.\nWith the exception of considering that these transfer operations are monitored by personnel at all times, no\nother mitigating controls were assumed to limit the releases.

The ERP has historically been coordinated with\nthe local volunteer fire department (St. Tammany Fire District No. 11) and will continue to be\ncoordinated in this manner.  As part of the community involvement efforts, the facility's\nmanagement attends a monthly \"Mayors Meeting\", and has coordinated an emergency response\ndrill with the local fire department, police department, and ambulance service which took place\nin October 1998.
