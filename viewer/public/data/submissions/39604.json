      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Pactiv Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of processes involving these substances. Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with the Malvern Fire Department and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic processor products such as polystyrene foam trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket.  We have one substance present at our facility which is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is a flammable blowing agent, and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The regulated substance at our facility is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  This product is also often called \"blowing agent\" or \"expansion agent\".\n\nThe maximum inventory of blowing agent possible at our facility exceeds the 10,000-pound RMP threshold.  Written operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent more than this amount from being present in the storage tank.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the a"

We also have received an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactiv Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP/Modified What If process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations, maintenance, and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pactiv Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nPactiv Corporation utilizes a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once per year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPactiv Corporation carries out routine, periodic m"

Process equipment examined during these inspections include but are not limited to pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  These personnel are provided with specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures at Pactiv Corporation are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.  Malvern has a PSM team that reviews all MOC's for our covered process.\n              \nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pactiv Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPactiv Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the requirements set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv Corporation promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any correct"

Reports are kept for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPactiv Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Many employees participate in safety initiatives within the plant.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor?s safety performance and program is carried out.  Pactiv Corporation has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nHot Work \nThe facility maintains a hot work program and issues a hot work permit for hot work conducted on or near the covered process.  Hot work is performed by qualified personnel who complete each permit and fulfill its requirements prior to the start of a hot work operation.  These permits are kept on file until the conclusion of the hot work operation and kept on file for a year.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nPactiv Corporation has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  There have been no incidents of accidental release during this period.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nPactiv Corporation has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with incidental fires and releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including prompt notification o"

The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. In addition, emergency response equipment (fire extinguishers, etc) is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\n6. Continuous Improvement of Safety\nOur primary goal for Pactiv is to protect the safety and health of our associates, the users of our products and the community in which we operate.  Our facility has exemplary occupational safety and health programs which encompass employee involvement, recognition for safe work, partnership with OSHA and continuous hazard identification activities.  Continuous improvement efforts have evolved from basic compliance inspections of equipment and facilities and measuring frequency rates, to that of behavioral observations, trend analysis, networking between various peer groups and focus on the quality and value of our efforts to create the desired results."
