By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the enviroment.\n\nRisk Management Program\n\nThis facility is subject to the Enviromental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Risk Management Program Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan.  The program requirements include submission of the risk management plan, hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, development of a process accidental release prevention program, and an emergency responce program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Program for Agriliance, Grant Fertilizer Terminal at Grant, Nebraska.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nInitial construction and operation of the Grant Fertilizer Terminal began in 1974.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia received and stored at this facility is used in the formulation of liquid fertilizers.\n\nThe Grant Fertilizer Teminal is a distribution facility for liquid fertilizers consisting of:   two 30,000 and one 12,000 gallon pressurized ammonia storage vessels, a 10-34-00 reactor, cooling tower, assorted liquid fertilizer storage tanks, and miscellaneous vessels and piping.

The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this terminal, the safety of it's employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve it's accidental release prevention goals, Agriliance is committed to the following:\n\n* A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n* A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n* Implementation of a Comprehensive Process Safety Management and Prevention Program\n* Continual review and improvements that enhance the safety and accident prevention\n* Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n*Planning, preparation, and training for emergency response\n\nThe Grant Terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan, as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, in effect for many years, and is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the enviroment.  The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Response Committee and Emergency Response Agencies.  Terminal personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the terminal.

This rule has required this facility to establish an accident prevention program which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPA's RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, store or process hazardous materials.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of the process activities.\n\nThe Grant terminal adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements, including routine training and testing of employees and drivers that operate any part of the process.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in these programs throughout it's years of operation.\n\nThe facility is diligent in adhering to and maintaining it's Process Safety/Prevention Program.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Grant Ammonia Terminal has established an Emergency Response Program and has a written Emergency Response Plan as required by the Risk Management Program rule and other Enviromental Protection Agency and OSHA rules.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \"public danger zone.\"  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release; however, as with the worst-case, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release- Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor, and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.

A large ammount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nAgriliance's hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from an 80 ton rail car unloading at the facility.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank car in 10 minutes.  This unlikely even was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with this type of release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event dictated by the rule and extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of pressurized vessel, facility maintence and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternate Case Toxic Release- Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical worst-case, tend to concetrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are throughout the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of a 1.25\" liquid hose.

A formal process hazard analysis revalidation is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanicl integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
