The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) in September 2009 and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years.  The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process.  For upcoming PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item database tracking system (SIMON).  The La Porte SMR manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nAir Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action.  These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAir Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the hydrogen purification process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topic as:  general orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.

      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nAir Liquide Large Industries, L.P. (Air Liquide) operates a steam methane reforming (SMR) process in in La Porte, Texas (the SMR is considered the covered process, as defined in the accidental release prevention regulations, having a flammable mixture in the process in excess of 10,000 pounds).  The SMR process involves reforming natural gas feedstock into hydrogen.  The hydrogen purification process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  Air Liquide's commitment to safety and environmental protection must extend beyond its gates.  As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area.  Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical\r\n\r\nThe SMR process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using natural gas feedstock.  Purified hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s).  The La Porte Hydrogen Plant also produces steam and electricity, sold directly to nearby industrial customers.  The La Porte SMR is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\r\n\r\nSteam Methane Reforming Process\r\n\r\nSteam methane reforming is a catalytic reaction between a light hydrocarbon feed stream (i.e., methane/natural gas) and steam (i.e., water) to produce a synthesis gas (syngas) comprised of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and residual amounts of carbon monoxide, methane, and water.  The methane and steam reaction takes place under pressure at elevated temperatures.  This requires heat be added to the process via a fired reactor (H2 heater), as a first step for the reaction to take place.  The high temperature resultant syngas effluent stream from the H2 heater is cooled producing steam and then reacted further to finish the reforming process.  The syngas stream is cooled further to r"

After the water has been removed, the hydrogen portion of the syngas is concentrated in a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit and exported to a hydrogen pipeline for distribution to customers.  The remainder of the syngas stream rejected by the PSA (primarily carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and unreacted hydrocarbon) is recovered and sent back to the H2 furnace to be used as fuel.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nAir Liquide's La Porte SMR is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.  The flammability of some of the chemicals in the process makes it necessary for Air Liquide to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses some of the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system (SMARTSOLVE) that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely.  Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these operating limits.\r\n\r\nThe Facility Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan described below.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  \r\n\r\nThe MI program assists with the verification and suitability of new and existing process equipment and, as well as quality control of spare parts and modifications to existing process equipment.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nAir Liquide's management of change (MOC) procedure has established the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change process.  The MOC procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact, and approving planned deviations from procedure.  All MOC's are submitted, reviewed by subjective matter specialist (such as Engineering, Risk Management, Operations, Health and Safety), approved, tracked and closed using the SmartCAPA system in the electronic document control system SMARTSOLVE.

Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes. \r\n\r\nSafe & Hot Work Permit System\r\n\r\nAir Liquide has a safe & hot work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  This system is comprised of a group of corporate procedures and standards under the life safety program.  Procedures in place included:  (1) energy control; (2) safe work; (3) hot work; (4) confined space entry.  Facility personnel are trained on these safe work practices to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nAir Liquide uses contractors to supplement its own work force when maintenance activities exceed the capabilities or time available for their own operators.  Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by PSM/RMP.
