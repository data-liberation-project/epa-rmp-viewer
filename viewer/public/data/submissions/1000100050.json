Baxter is a hospital products and pharmaceutical manufacturer specializing in IV solutions and premixed drugs, IV infusion pumps and administration sets, parenteral nutrition, etc.\r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 325412. The facility uses ethylene oxide for product sterilization, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. \r\n\r\nTwo (2), 400 pound cylinders of ethylene oxide are connected to each sterilization vessel at all times. In Vessel 7 drum room there is one (1) sterilization vessel in use at one time and a capacity to store six (6) cylinders, for a total of eight (8) ethylene oxide cylinders or 3,200 pounds. In the new drum room, there are a total of six (6) sterilization vessels used at one time and a capacity to store six (6) cylinders, for a total of eighteen (18) ethylene oxide cylinders, or 7200 pounds. In addition, the total capacity of the outdoor storage facility is thirty (30) cylinders, resulting in a potential of 12,000 pounds of ethylene oxide in the outdoor storage facility. Therefore, the total potential quantity of ethylene on-site is approximately 22,400 pounds.\r\n\r\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
