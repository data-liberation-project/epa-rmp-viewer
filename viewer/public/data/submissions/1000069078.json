Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system. The written information includes the MSDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system. The written information also includes the MSDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, and basic information about the chemistry of the refrigeration system, and the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system.\r\n3. Process Hazards Analysis: A formal analysis using the whwt-if Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards. For each Management of change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\r\n4. Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been developed that describe the steps to be followed tp operate the refrigeration system safely.
