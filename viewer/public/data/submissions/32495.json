The ammonia is used in freezing of corn, cob corn, peas and chub corn.\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed as required and comply with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.110 and EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68.  The key prevention steps at the facility consit of the following:\nEmployee Participations\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractor Requirements\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity Audits\nHot Work Permits\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Planning and Response\nCompliance Audits\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Waseca facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Waseca Fire Department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Birds Eye Foods is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combinations of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  The plant has had a safety consultant from the Department of Labor and Safety in for a plant inspection and follow up in March of 2003.  Zurich Insurance inspection was in Januaury 2004.\nDESCRIPTION\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers, that are used to change the state of NH3 from a gas to a liquid and is an open system.  This means that the motor and compressor are separate entities,"
