      "SummaryText": "\u00a7 68.155 Executive Summary\r\n(b) The Hollywood Road Water Reclamation Facility, a City of Amarillo Facility, located approximated six miles southeast of downtown Amarillo in Randall County. The Hollywood Facility is capable of treating 12 million gallons per day (MGD) of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. Currently, the daily average ranges between 8.2 to 8.7 MGD. The facility uses an activated sludge sewage treatment process and operates 24 hours a day. A maximum of eighteen tons of chlorine gas, the primary disinfectant, are stored on-site. A maximum of ten tons of sulfur dioxide, used in the dechlorination process, are stored on-site. Only three cylinders are in use at one time.\r\n(a)(c) Emergency closures systems are in place to close all three in-use chemical cylinders at once. This system is tested on a regular basis. Ongoing safety training programs cover all phases of facility operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The Hollywood Road facility conducts formal training as well as on-site training during normal daily operations. A controlled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide will be defined as the escape of gas resulting from standard operating procedures to connect or disconnect gas containers and standard maintenance procedures on the gas delivery system. Minor leaks in the system that can be promptly repaired or shut off will also be considered controlled releases.
