We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and overseen assistance with this speciality firm.  The program consists of iternal audit utilizing chscklists survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and local regulations are covered.  These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Procedures require a timel;y response and correction of all recommendations resulting from these audit checklists.               \n\nA \"Site Safety Coordinator\" is identified and used as an extension of the general manager and management service personnel for a \"hands on\" manager of the day to day safe working activities, "

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to complywith this Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops. \n\nOur facility maintains five, 1,500-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 7500 gallons or 35,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank with 18,000 gallons on site.  84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tank.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for this location is 119,000 pounds.  The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greates amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds.  According to the DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off-site impac"

      "SummaryText": "t.  It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an anhydrous ammonia staroage facility would not reach an endpoint off-site.  The alternate release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shutdown.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 300 pounds for a storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint would have an impact.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards (1989 edition), OSHA - 29 CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose to filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill lines breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose would fail.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.  Lighting for the facility has increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventitive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves hoses, excess flow valves, guages, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines within the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annuall, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulation"

In accordance with the 1989 ANSI standards, training is also offered for all ammonia customers to attend on a regular basis and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations.  These training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or compact disc, testing both verbally and written, demonstration and observation for each person working with the process that are certified while on-going job training is always improved upon.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that has caused deaths, recordable injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off site."
