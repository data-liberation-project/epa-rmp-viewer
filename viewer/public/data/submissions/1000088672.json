Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.\n\nUnivar makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse. The facility receives 55-gallon drums of pentane and isopentane on pallets containing four (4) drums each from box trucks at the loading docks.  The drums are moved by forklift from the trucks to the warehouse storage area of the facility.  The flammable storage area is protected by a fire monitoring and suppression system.  The warehouse is divided by fire walls and doors to segregate the flammable storage areas from the rest of the warehouse.  The site maintains a strict no smoking policy for the drum movement and storage areas.   The drums are moved by forklift out of the warehouse and onto box trucks at the shipping docks.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.univarsolutions.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.

Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release. Univar maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers. This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nWe have never had a release of pentane that has resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees will not respond offensively to releases of hazardous materials, but will rely on local emergency responders in the event of a release. Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response actions. This facility regularly invites the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plant and gain familiarity with our operations. This facility has a written emergency preparedness plan that is updated regularly.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews. We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry. Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.\n\n"
