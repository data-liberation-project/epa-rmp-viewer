This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that Claxton Poultry is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  \n\n2.  Claxton Poultry utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for poultry production.  Refrigeration is necessary for conditioning the room air in production areas, cooling water used as a secondary coolant, and maintaining product at desired temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia was selected because of its excellent heat transfer capabilities.\n\n3.  Accident History\nThe facility has had no reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n4.
