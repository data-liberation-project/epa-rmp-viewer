A flange gasket was found to be leaking approximately one drop every five minutes, and is estimated to be less than 0.1 pound of dilute chlorine dioxide solution released. (Note:  The quantity released was entered as one pound in the Accident 1 section, 6.5, as that is the minimum quantity that can be entered.)  During investigation, the release slowed and came to a stop. The gasket was replaced during the next opportunity. The team also recommended review of system components, preventative maintenance procedures, and employee gas monitor training. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\r\nPixelle's personnel and procedures are prepared to coordinate the activities of the facility and maintain an emergency response team trained in emergency response procedures.  Pixelle periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local fire department, the first-response emergency team, the Corporate Crisis Management Team, and local emergency response agencies.  Pixelle employees will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, employees will be evacuated from the area, the Pixelle Emergency Response Team will be responsible for initial response and assessment, and contact with the Chillicothe City Fire Department as necessary.  All Pixelle personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.\r\n \r\nPixelle has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n- Informing the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences;\r\n- Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accid"

Pixelle provides appropriate information to and regularly communicates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Chillicothe and Ross County fire chiefs.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nPixelle constantly strives to improve the safety of these regulated processes.  Through the PSM PHA and Audit programs, incident investigation action items, and ongoing employee participation in all safety programs, the planning and implementation of changes to reduce risk and improve safety is a continuous process.  Pixelle conducted the most recent PHA in 4/1/2013.  Action items were implemented as a result of the PHA process that reduces the likelihood of a Chlorine Dioxide release."

As part of that commitment, Pixelle has established management systems to maximize the safety of operating processes at this facility.  One component of this design is a risk management plan (RMP) that guides the safe handling, storage, and usage of regulated hazardous substances at Pixelle and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  \r\n\r\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Pixelle.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Pixelle.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at Pixelle consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1) Hazard assessments to analyze and understand (a) the potential for offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accident and incident investigations that have occurred involving substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see Emergency Response Plan Topics 1.3 and 1.5.\r\n\r\n2) Prevention programs to help maintain and safely operate those processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance - see Emergency Response Plan Topic 1.4.\r\n\r\n3) Emergency planning for public notification and response should an accidental release of a regulated substance from covered processes ever occur - see Emergency Response Plan Topic 1.6.\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\r\n\r\nPixelle's risk management planning is designed to assure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.

When a hazardous substance must be used, Pixelle thoroughly reviews the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, and the environment and manages its processes to prevent such effects.\r\n\r\nPixelle prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. \r\nPixelle is committed to the safety of employees, the public, the preservation of the environment, and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at Pixelle, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  In conjunction with best engineering practices, government and industry standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nPixelle follows industry standards (e.g., Department of Transportation [DOT]), National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], The Chlorine Institute, and manufacturers' guidelines) to maximize the safe handling, storage, and usage of all hazardous materials.

Pixelle handles one regulated toxic (no flammable) substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nAs part of the manufacturing process at this facility, Chlorine Dioxide is used as a stock bleaching agent in the Pulp Mill and is inventoried at quantities above the EPA threshold limit and is regulated by the RMP rule.  This system is regulated and compliance is managed in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  As such, it is designated as Program Level 3 process for RMP rule compliance purposes.\r\n\r\nRegulated Process                Program Level               Substance                    Quantity\r\nChlorine Dioxide Storage               3                  Chlorine Dioxide                30,000 lb\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSES\r\nPixelle has performed offsite consequence analyses to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analyses consist of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Pixelle does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.

      "SummaryText": "scenario was selected to aid local emergency planning committee in improving the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like Pixelle, and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analyses is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  When considering the release of a toxic substance, it is expected that people at the endpoint distance would experience little or no exposure, with no long-term health consequences.  However, the potential for some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye irritation, or throat irritation), while not likely, does exist.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could become incapacitated.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nPixelle maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place at Pixelle include:\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Prevention Program.\r\nSince 1963, Pixelle has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Pixelle formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, in accordance with the EPA RMP rule, one Program 3 process was identified.  RMP requirements for this system are essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of Pixelle's prevention program that address the RMP rule prevention program and ERP requirements.\r\n\r\nPixelle's Prevention Program for the RMP Pro"

For each regulated process, these documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Pixelle; (2) operating parameters of the equipment at Pixelle; and (3) the technical and design bases, and configuration of the equipment.  Pixelle ensures that this process safety information is available to all Pixelle employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the Chillicothe Fire Department.\r\n \r\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects, or in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analysis of the process.  Operating parameters are included in the standard operating procedures to enhance the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used in (1) employee training; (2) performing process hazard analyses; and (3) the monitoring and maintenance of equipment. \r\n\r\nSafety data sheets (SDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Pixelle, including regulated substances in covered processes.  SDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the process control room so the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, SDSs are provided to the LEPC and the fire department as required for use in developing emergency response plans.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nIn accordance with the Process Safety Management Standard and to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process, Pixelle conducts and recertifies process hazard analysis (PHA) of the regulated process.  PHA review teams composed of personnel with process-specific design, operating"

Pixelle primarily uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology in conjunction with What if?/Checklist techniques to review and report the analysis.  Recommendations and action items resulting from the analysis are documented and tracked to completion.  Responsibility to resolve action items are assigned to unit personnel, and where appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nPixelle process safety personnel, engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to regulated process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nPixelle provides basic chemical specific HAZCOM training for all employees.  Pixelle trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  For current hazardous process operations personnel, Pixelle training programs include both initial and refresher training that cover (1) general overview of the process; (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process; and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Both oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the appropriate level of training prior to working in, on, or around a regulated process.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\r\nPixelle maintains the mechanical integrity of regulated process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.

For regulated processes, all not-in-kind, non-emergency changes must have prior review and qualified approval before the change can be implemented.  This is to prevent inadvertent consequences of a process change, and to ensure any potential hazards created by the change are proactively recognized and addressed; affected process safety information and procedures are updated; and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\r\nPixelle performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that: \r\n- Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; \r\n- Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place; and\r\n- Employee training has been completed.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\r\nPixelle audits regulated processes to be certain that the Pixelle prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of its operations.  Pixelle maintains a cross-corporate audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in PSM, the RMP rule, and in the regulated processes.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the PSM and RMP standards as well as corporate health, safety, and environmental policies; and whether or not the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.

Pixelle trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  A qualified investigation team will initiate an investigation within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION \r\nPixelle has a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of Pixelle workers are addressed.  Pixelle encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\r\nCompliance with documented standard safe work practices, including hot work safety, confined space entry, and zero energy potential policies are required operating and maintenance procedures.\r\n\r\nHOT WORK PERMITS\r\nPixelle has an established hot work management system to control spark and flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Pixelle facility.  In accordance with OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), Pixelle implemented a Hot Work Permit Process.  Personnel preparing to perform hot work are required to conduct a pre-work inspection of the area and complete a Hot Work Permit Form.  A Pixelle Area Supervisor (in the work area), must review and approve the completed form before the hot work can begin.

Pixelle instructs contract supervisors as to the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, all Pixelle safe work practices, and Pixelle emergency response procedures.  Pixelle requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at Pixelle, before that worker begins work at the facility.  Pixelle periodically reviews contractor's training documents and audits work performance to help ensure safe practices are followed. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Pixelle has implemented safety features specific to regulated hazardous substance used at the facility.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide - To avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of a hazardous material, Pixelle produces Chlorine Dioxide at the facility and stores it as a dilute aqueous solution.  Chlorine Dioxide is generated on-site using the R8 process in the Chlorine Dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1wt% Chlorine Dioxide solution is generated.  A diked area around the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere has been one recordable accidental release that has occurred within the past five years at Pixelle. The incident occurred on July 13, 2016 when an employee was flushing the chlorine dioxide lines to prepare for a maintenance outage.  The employee smelled chlorine dioxide while working in the area for five to ten minutes; however, his personal ClO2 monitor did not alarm. The incident was reported the following day and the employee received medical treatment. The re"
