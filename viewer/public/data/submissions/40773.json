Over the past years. HCWD#1 has spent $20,000 for a building to store and confine 2,000 lb(4total) chlorine cyclinders to minimize escaping cl2 gas,a cl2 gas detector was installed to instantly set off alarms if a cl2 leak is detected over 3 ppm ( parts per million) so HCWD#1 could take immediate action to notify surrounding residences, police, medical personnel, fire department, and local government agencies.                                                                                                                                                    PWP's plan for accidental prevention is following Standard Operating Procedures(s.o.p.'s) in handling cl2, daily inspections by the operators of the equipment used in the processes and routine maintenance on the equipment used on the processes. Reviewing chlorine handling safety video's, periodically reviewing sop's. Emergency responce procedures at our facility is as follows.                                                               \n\n1. Notify the facility Emergency Response Coordinator or the alternate of the potential problem.\n\n2. Put on appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (MSA SCBA, rubber gloves, etc.).\n\n3. Verify leak visually with ammonia (assuming there is no obvious visible plume).\n\n4. Should a leak be confirmed: Plant personnel should place the following equipment in the company \n    vehicle and evacuate the site - backup MSA SCBA, cordless telephone, portable radio, and TAB Q-7\n    manual.\n\n5. Prior to exiting the plant the wind direction should be observed and noted. Wind direction will dictate personnel evacuation route as well as emergency response personnel's approach to the plant.\n\n6. At first opportunitt, once clear from the site, evacuating personnel should contact Mr. "
