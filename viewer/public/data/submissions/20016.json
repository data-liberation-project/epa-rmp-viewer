      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted by General Chemical Corporation's Delaware Valley Works in compliance with the requirements of section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and was prepared in accordance with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention program requires the owner of a stationary source having listed substances present in quantities greater than the corresponding threshold quantities to develop and implement a risk management program. The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for 3 different programs of compliance dependent upon the eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical releases as identified in the hazard assessment.  For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.  \n\n\n\nAt General Chemical Delaware Valley Works, five listed chemicals are managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to program level 3 criteria include Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Oleum, Methyl Chloride and liquid Sulfur Dioxide.  Liquid Sulfur Dioxide is used sparingly and is not maintained on-site at all times.   Because liquid Sulfur Dioxide is not currently managed on-site, but may be during the next five years, General Chemical is filing a predictive RMP for future use of liquid Sulfur Dioxide."

These products include sulfur-based chemicals, fluoborates, sulfuric acid, and other specialty products.  Delaware Valley Works occupies 130 acres on the lower Delaware River.  It is divided into North and South portions by Philadelphia Pike.  The North Plant contains batch reactors used to make specialty chemical products.  The South Plant houses the sulfuric acid plant and units for making photo salt products.  Support facilities at the plant includes warehouse space, product packaging line, loading and unloading facilities for trucks, and railcars.  The plant also contains its own product testing laboratory, as well as research and development facilities. \n\n\n\nNine production processes at Delaware Valley Works use one or more of the regulated chemicals identified above.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n3.1\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by the USEPA is a hypothetical accident for one of the chemicals at a site.  It assumes that all safety systems in the facility simultaneously fails and that all of the chemical in the largest container holding it at a site is released in a very short time. A USEPA-designated table defines the distance the material will travel until it disperses so much that it is no longer hazardous.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario at General Chemical's Delaware Valley Works assumes that a rail car containing liquid Sulfur Dioxide fails. The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems fail, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The USEPA-designated table states that the material released would travel 16 miles before it reaches a non-hazardous concentration. \n\n\n\n3.2\tAlternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible hypothetical, site-specific chemical release. It takes into account safety and release prevention systems and procedures used at the plant to control releases. It is more realistic than the worst case scenario; is calculated from a USEPA-designated table; and, is used to plan a facility's emergency response to accidents. \n\n\n\n3.2.1\tThe alternative case release scenario for liquid Sulfur Dioxide at Delaware Valley Works assumes liquid Sulfur D"
