      "SummaryText": " ISK Magnetics Inc., is a manufacturer of iron oxides for magnetic storage media.  One of the raw materials used in our process is agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia.\n Ammonia is a common material that has been produced in the United States since 1890.  About 80% of all ammonia produced is used in agriculture, as a nitrogen source for plants and a protein source in livestock feeds.  Some other common uses for ammonia are: metal treating, pharmaceuticals, synthetic textile fibers, plastics, water treatment, and pollution control devices.  Ammonia is also the material of choice in large refrigeration systems.  Ammonia is classified as a nonflammable gas with a reportable quantity of 100 pounds.\n ISK uses detailed operating and maintenance procedures to maintain the safe operation of this system; in addition, all employees have regular refresher training.  Ammonia sensors are strategically located to alert personnel of leaks, and remote shut off valves and excess flow devices can minimize the effect of a failed component.\n This Risk Management Program submittal requires the listing of ammonia-related releases and injuries in the last 5 years.  ISK has had no releases or injuries in this period; therefore, the data fields are blank.  The Management of ISK is committed to operating this system in a safe and responsible manor, protecting our employees and the surrounding community."
