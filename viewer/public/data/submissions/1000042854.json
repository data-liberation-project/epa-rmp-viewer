      "SummaryText": "FHR MARYSVILLE - EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY\n\n \n\n1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  \n\nFlint Hills Resources, LP purchased the Marysville Facility (FHR Marysville) in an asset purchase on August 1, 2007 and ownership was transferred to Flint Hills Resources Polymers, LLC in 2011. FHR Marysville is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  The FHR Marysville site maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements these policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  FHR Marysville participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  The FHR Marysville site has remained both a safe and quality supplier for over 20 years in Southeastern Michigan as exemplified by our continuing certification to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001 quality management process.\n\n\n\nFHR Marysville is located in the southwestern corner of the City of Marysville, Michigan.  The site includes 58.6 acres, of which 20 acres have been developed.  The Marysville Site utilizes a continuous polymerization operation to convert pipeline-supplied propylene and ethylene into polypropylene pellets which molding companies then process into useful applications such as:  automotive trim, toys, medical containers, appliance parts, and other consumer products.  Propane is produced as a by-product of propylene purification.\n\n\n\n2.    Regulated Substances.\n\nFHR Marysville has 2 regulated substances above threshold quantities at the facility.  The two flammable substances are:\n\n\n\n    Propylene - Used to produce synthetic polymer resins.\n\n    Propane - Used widely for home heating.\n\n\n\n3.    Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) be performed"

The OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of flammable substances.   \n\n\n\nFHR Marysville used LandView 6, software supplied by the USEPA et al., to estimate the residential population within the distance to endpoint for both the Worst Case Release and Alternative Case Release Scenarios.  FHR Marysville also used knowledge of the surrounding area in estimating affected populations. \n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. \n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that FHR Marysville has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFHR Marysville maintains a compilation of written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\n\n\n Hazards of regulated substances:  For RMP regulated substances, there are Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n\n\n The technology of the process:  This includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\n\n\n Equipment in the process:  This includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nFHR Marysville has performed process hazard analyses (PHA) on the polypropylene process to identify any potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls, and ways to m"

The Marysville Site assigns employees to the PHA team who are to be knowledgeable in the PHA methodology and the specific process.  The PHA team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are to be implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFHR Marysville maintains written operating procedures developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address operating phases, safety systems, control measures, and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n \n\nTraining\n\nFHR Marysville provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphas safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  Operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFHR Marysville develops written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper functioning of process equipment.\n\n \n\nManagement of Change\n\nFHR Marysville has written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and other changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures are to assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change; its impact on safety and h"

Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected by the change, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  \n\n  \n\nPre-Startup Review\n\nFHR Marysville performs pre-startup safety reviews when a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; management-of-change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n\n \n\nCompliance Audit\n\nFHR Marysville performs audits to evaluate its compliance with the provisions of its PSM and RMP programs.  Teams, which are to be comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\n \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFHR Marysville investigates incidents, including those that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.

FHR Marysville consults with employees on the conduct and development of PHA's and on the development of other elements of the PSM and RMP programs.  FHR Marysville provides employees access to PHA's and other PSM/RMP information.\n\n \n\nHot Work Permit\n\nFHR Marysville employs a hot work permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If hot work is performed near the covered process, FHR Marysville issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot work permits are kept on file until the work is complete.  \n\n \n\nContractors\n\n FHR Marysville has developed procedures for selecting and maintaining competent and knowledgeable contractors.  These procedures are intended to ensure that contractors can safely perform their work.
