The site follows the philosophy \"Commitment to ZERO\", which constantly strives for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  Site programs, procedures and management practices are in place to support our organizations commitment.  Progress is constantly assessed against our commitment and corrective actions are taken whenever necessary.  Although the primary focus of the facility is on accidental release prevention, the site also possesses and maintains strong emergency response capabilities to back-up prevention activities.  The combination of prevention programs and emergency response capabilities is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as, the protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u0095\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) Risk Management Program regulation;\n\u0095\tA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n\u0095\tAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n\u0095\tAn overview of our Emergency Response program;\n\u0095\tA five-year history of accidental release of chemicals regulated by the EPA rule;\n\u0095\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees,   he public, and the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Chambers Works facility first opened in the early 1900s as a dye manufacturing plant.  On July 1, 2015, DuPont spun off the Performance Chemicals business into a new company (The Chemours Company FC LLC).  Chemours became the"

These scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information has been used on Chambers Works for many years as part of our process safety management program. Our program parameters model potential releases and analyze the results to help the site continuously improve process and risk reduction efforts. The site continues to conduct these assessments as part of internal process safety management systems. Release scenario details can be found in the site's Risk Management Plan. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nFor many years, employees at Chambers works have applied rigorous process safety management practices to all our processes, not just those covered by regulations.  These practices include:\n\u0095\tA thorough understanding of our process technology including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of constriction for equipment;\n\u0095\tProper design and installation of equipment:\n\u0095\tSystematic process hazard review studies to identify and manage process hazards;\n\u0095\tWritten operating and maintenance procedures;\n\u0095\tExtensive training for all individuals involved in operating or maintaining a chemical process;\n\u0095\tMechanical integrity testing and preven"

They are able to respond to any chemical release to mitigate the impact.   The site is committed to maintaining strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  The Emergency Response brigade is comprised of both Chemours and DuPont employees and are specially trained operators that can respond in the event of an onsite chemical release. The Emergency Response team is thoroughly trained, properly equipped and staffed 24 hours a day.  Chambers Works conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  These drills simulate potential accidental release and test emergency response plans.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no incidents in the past 5 years that meet the Risk Management Plan reporting criteria.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs part of our process hazards review procedures, all of our processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  As a result of these studies, we are currently assessing and/or implementing the following risk reduction activities:\n\u0095\tImproving the control of the process by installing better instrumentation, more automatic process shutdown interlocks, and upgraded computer control systems;\n\u0095\tImproving preventive maintenance inspections and data analysis;\n\u0095\tImproving our training programs; and\n\u0095\tConducting process safety audits to identify"
