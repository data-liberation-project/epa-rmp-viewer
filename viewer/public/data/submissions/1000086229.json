This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery, located in Anacortes, Washington, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has not had an RMP-related accident over the past 5 years.  However, Shell has an incident investigation program to determine the causes of accidents to determine ways to help prevent similar accidents from occurring. \r\n \r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Shell Puget Sound Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each PSM program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. Through the BEST (Behavioral Education for a Safer Today) Program, employees have designed and implemented a behavior based safety program which encourages modifications to behavior to work safer.  This program utilizes peer observations of work practices and participation on safety teams.  The program has the stated goal that We all return home healthy and safe. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  The refinery process uses controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pre"

Employees receive training in these actions and procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The ERP is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. Changes to the ERP are communicated to the personnel assigned to emergency response and training is provided if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Shell Puget Sound Refinery is coordinated with the Skagit County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Shell Puget Sound Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Shell Puget Sound Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  In addition, as a participant of the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group, CAER provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery resolves findings from PHAs, incident investigations, audits, and other studies, some of which result in modifications to the process.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATIONAL CHART\r\nA link to our organizational chart is located on the Puget Sound Refinery website on the Process Safety Department webpage."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to recognize hazards and to verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to a variety of departments for consideration and resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking provided in the hazard and effects register.  It is Shell Puget Sound Refinery's policy to resolve all open findings in a timely manner.  The time necessary to resolve a finding varies, depending on the nature of the finding and circumstances.  For example, as a general rule, high risk findings are resolved within one year or less, unless the resolution of the finding requires a unit or plant shutdown to complete, or other conditions limit the ability of the plant to resolve the open finding.  Medium risk findings are completed at the next convenient opp"

This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Shell Puget Sound Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor various contractor safety performance to confirm that such contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. Electronic tracking systems are used to manage and document the results and findings from these updates, all approved mitigation options being implemented in response to the PHA team findings, and the final resolution of each finding.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell Puget Sound Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  There is a training program that is designed to provide new operators with basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After attending the training program, new operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) addressing findings identified, if any, during inspections and tests, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to verify the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Shell Puget Sound Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has long-standing"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be reviewed pursuant to the MOC process before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, affected personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nShell Puget Sound Refinery promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
