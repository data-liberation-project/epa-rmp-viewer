A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for packaging and distribution.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating production areas, coolers and freezers throughout the facility. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently onsite has been estimated at approximately 28,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
