The stationary source is Giant Distribution Center. Which is  located at 1621 Industrial Drive, Carlisle, PA 17013.  The site is owned by Giant Food Stores, Inc. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia - classification is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. This facility was expanded to its current  in November 1999.   In July 2006, 4 additional banana rooms were added to the facility.  The new banana rooms tie into the system and require the addition of 700 pounds of ammonia to maintain the manufactures recommended safe operating pressure.   The system is included in this RMP with the Process Overview describing the system.  A 2012 addition inclusive of 22 dock doors and material handling areas moved total process inventories to the current approximately 31,403 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in its refrigeration system. This RMP is written to meet the Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThe facility has a complete Process Management Program in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM). This program includes a process hazard analysis using the what-if techniques.   \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. This facility has a good working relationship with the Cumberland County LEPC. The plan has been provided to and reviewed with the LEPC and local fire department.\n\n\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \n\nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of 509.4 TR @ +30A?F high temperature and 768.2 TR @ +14A?F medium temperature. This refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulation system and is designed to operate at an o"

      "SummaryText": "verfeed ratio of approximately 4:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw and reciprocating compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThere are multiple mitigating measures in place. The location of  the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. There is a fire sprikler system in the refrigeration machinery room and throughout this facility. The overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on RMP Comp.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high pressure receiver as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This scenario impacts off-site populations.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated in this hazard assessment include two possible scenarios. First alternate scenario (OCA-2)  is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes. The  of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (79.6 lbs/min) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes. \n\n\n\nThe second alternative scenario (OCA-3) is the direct release of liquid from a A? \"  diameter hole/valve in a vessel having an internal pressure of 181.1 psig. This scenario impacts off-site populations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program, in addition to special requirem"
