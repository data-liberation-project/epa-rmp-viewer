An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane, and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  As this mixture moves through the plant production process, it comes to contain ammonia as well.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n \n\nHydrochloric acid, nitric acid, argon, nitric oxide, ammonium polyphosphate, urea ammonium nitrate, and urea-formaldehyde are also stored at the facility, but are not subject to RMP for the reasons discussed below.  Hydrochloric acid and nitric acid are stored in concentrations lower than the minimum necessary to be considered an RMP substance (40 CFR 68.130 Table 1).  Hydrochloric acid is subject to the RMP rule if it is stored in concentrations of 37% or greater.  Nitric acid must be at a concentration of 80% or greater to be subject to the rule.  The Enid Nitrogen Plant stores these substances at concentrations no greater than 20% and 56%, respectively.  Argon is stored at the facility; however, it is not a listed RMP substance.  Nitric Oxide is found in the process but in amounts less than threshold quantity.  Urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium polyphosphate are mixtures that do not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making these products exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Formaldehyde solutions are subject to RMP reporting.  However; urea-formaldehyde (CAS # 9011-05-6), which is stored at the facility, is not considered \u00bfa formaldehyde solution but a complex polymer molecule\u00bf according to the Frequently Asked Questions (Question II.36) on EPA\u00bfs website.

These high standards include:\n\n\u00bfOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u00bfOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00bfOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00bfCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Enid Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\u00bfPreventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of a release of ammonia by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\n\u00bfReducing the severity of fires and providing a means to control vapor cloud formation with fire monitors located throughout the facility.\n\u00bfReducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms and/or in"

Two of these incidents (June 2007 and November 4, 2007) resulted in a reportable injury.  None of the incidents resulted in offsite impacts; however, two of the incidents (in November) resulted in significant property damage.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Enid Nitrogen Plant with the Enid Fire Department, the Garfield County Sheriff, and the Garfield County LEPC.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Oklahoma State Police, and Oklahoma Gas and Electric and St. Mary\u00bfs Regional Medical Center.  The Enid Nitrogen Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.

This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u00bfInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u00bfAn ongoing dialogue with the Garfield County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops. \n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Garfield County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.

KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKNC\u00bfs Enid Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia, urea fertilizer, and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is also injected into the main pipeline to be transported to distribution terminals.    \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of two ammonia units, a urea production unit, and a UAN unit.  Ancillary units include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station, an argon separation plant, and an ammonium polyphosphate portable unit that is at the plant for approximately one week twice per year.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer in the urea production unit.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.   \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are"
