All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The WSP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the Hays Water Softening Plant facility and to the emergency response services available in the Water Plant, Public Works,City and Community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB). The Water Softening Plant Chlorination Station has been installed to disinfect the water flow into the City of Hays water distribution system. The chlorination system is located on the southeast corner of the main building at 1000 Vine Street Hays, KS The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, additional safety equipment and a digital atmosphere reading of chlorine in parts per million, that can be read outside the chlorine storage room and in the lab. The amount of chlorine handled is 4 one-ton containers and 20 one hundred fifty pound containers. The chlorine station is checked every two hours by plant operator in a 24 hour day seven days a week and will respond to any trouble alarms which may occur in a matter of minutes.\nD). The general DWS accident release prevention program is based on the following key elements: \nHigh level of training of the water plant staff .  \nPreventive maintenance program.\nUse of state-of the-art process and safety equipment. \nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of water plant staff.\nPerformance of a  hazard review of equipment and procedures and an emergency response plan that is in effect. \n\nE).

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations. Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed periodically. \nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of self contained-breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors. \n\nF). The water plant has updated some of its safety equipment and has reviewed all its programs related to safety. With the completion of its Vulnerability Assessment the water plant has updated all its emergency plans.\n\nG.) The water plant had no accidents within the last 5 years."
