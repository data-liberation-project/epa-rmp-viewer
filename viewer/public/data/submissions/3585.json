IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR,THE FACILITY IS PREPARED\n           TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE\n           ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE\n          ENVIRONMENT.\n\n          2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n               THE PRIMARY ACTIVITIY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF\n          FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n                ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT \n         APPLICATION. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n                THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 340,000 POUNDS\n         IN OUR 18,000 AND 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY\n         HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING  40,000 POUNDS.\n\n          3. THE WORST CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n          A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE\n          THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A  GAS\n          OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM  QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 80,000 POUNDS\n          WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY\n          AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION\n          TO 200 PPM) IS .94 MILES.\n\n          B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE\n          HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN  A 3 INCH PIPE. THE \n          DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .78 M"
