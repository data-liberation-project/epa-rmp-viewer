The\nmixture is used as a propellant for aerosol paint cans.\n\nFinished goods are transferred to the warehouse for storage and\ndistribution.  Mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids\nare stored in 12- or 18-ounce cans.  Approximately 341,000 pounds of\npropellant may be stored in the well-protected warehouse at any one time.\n\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant\nis not inherently toxic.\n\n2.0     POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIO\n2.1     WORST-CASE SCENARIO\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, a worst-case release from the\nlargest single container was analyzed to assess the maximum distance to\nthe flammable endpoint.  The release scenarios analyzed and the\nendpoints evaluated are based on the guidance contained in the USEPAs\nRisk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (the\nPropane Guidance), dated March 4, 1999, and the USEPAs Offsite\nConsequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG), dated April 1999.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that failure of the largest single\ncontainer, an 18-ounce aerosol can, results in a release of propellant\nand flammable liquid vapor.  The released material is assumed to form a\nvapor cloud which comes into contact with an ignition source and\ndetonates.\nThe endpoint for this release is defined as an overpressure of 1 pound per\nsquare inch caused by the explosion and is considered the threshold for\npotential serious injuries to people as a result of property damage caused\nby an explosion.  Based on the contents of an 18-ounce"

No public receptors are\nlocated within the endpoint distance.\n3.0     ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Rust-Oleum,\nHagerstown, Maryland warehouse in the last 5 years that have resulted in\ndeath, injury, or significant property damage on site; or off-site death,\ninjury, property damage, evacuation , sheltering in place, or\nenvironmental damage.\n4.0     PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by\nthe RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational\ncontrols are in place to decrease the severity or prevent the occurrence of\na fire or explosion.  The most significant controls are described below:\n\n  The warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance\nwith the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Manufacture and\nStorage of Aerosol Products code (NFPA 30B).\n\n The rack storage system is designed for flammable materials storage in\naccordance with the NFPA Code for the Rack Storage of Material (NFPA\n231C).\n\nAll electrical equipment meets the requirements of the National Electric\nCode (NFPA 70).\n\n  The warehouse and rack system are fully sprinklered using an\nautomatic aqueous film forming foam system.\n\n5.0     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Rust-Oleum, Hagerstown facility has implemented a detailed written\nEmergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all\nemergencies at the facility, including incidents related to a release of\npropellant.\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for plant employees,\ncoordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel\nin the facility.  The EAP identifies specific individuals and their\nresponsibilities, and identifies procedures for emergency medical care.\nAdditionally, the Rust-Oleum manufacturing facility, located less than\none city block from"
