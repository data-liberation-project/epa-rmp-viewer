              "Description": "Ammonia Neutralization Process\n     The ammonia neutralization process is a batch process in which acids are neutralized with anhydrous ammonia (NH3) in a stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor) and an atmospheric vessel (blend tank). The ammonia flow to the reactors and blend vessels is controlled so that almost all of the ammonia is reacted. Any excess ammonia is vented to the plant thermal oxidizer, where it is burned. Safety relief devices are installed on the reactor to prevent catastrophic failure of the reactor should an unlikely overpressurization occur. Overpressurization is not possible on the atmospheric tanks, so no relief system is necessary on the blend vessels. \n     The major bulk of the ammonia onsite is in the storage tank. The storage tank is a 250 psig rated pressure vessel. Safety relief devices are also installed on the tank to prevent a rupture of the tank that might be caused by an overpressurization. The ammonia pressure at all ambient temperature conditions is well below 200 psig. An excess flow valve is also installed between the tank and the plant piping that will stop the flow of ammonia from the tank as a result of a pipe failure or an excessive flow rate to the reactor or blend tank. Check valves are also installed in the ammonia delivery lines to the reactor to prevent backflow of potential contaminants to the storage vessel.\n     The loading of the storage tank from a delivery truck is accomplished by use of a closed loop vapor recycle system in which the liquid ammonia is pumped from the bottom of the tank truck by a compressor to the bottom of the storage tank, and the ammonia vapor from the top of the storage tank is recycled back to the tank truck so that no ammonia is exhausted to the atmosphere. The plant operator and truck driver manage the following:  the connection of the truck to the storage vessel, the unloading of the truck, and the uncoupling of the truck from the storage tank. The plant operators and truck drivers have been trained and are experienced in the safe handling of ammonia.\n     A process hazards analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the process from truck delivery to reactor operation and finished product. Written operating procedures are in place to ensure ongoing integrity of the process equipment and piping. Inspections include ultrasound thickness tests and visual inspection of glass-lined reactors. Leaking pumps, lines and valves are tagged and repaired by maintenance in a timely manner.",

              "Description": "Sulfur Dioxide Process\n     The Sulfur Dioxide process (aka bisulfite process) is analogous to the ammonia neutralization process in that it is a batch process where sulfur dioxide (SO2) is reacted in a pressurized, stirred, glass-lined tank reactor. The reactor is protected by safety relief devices from a potential catastrophic failure caused by overpressurization. The difference between the bisulfite batch process and the ammonia neutralization batch process is that SO2 is acidic and ammonia is basic.\n     The SO2 addition (flow) to the reactor is controlled so that it is almost completely reacted. Any excess SO2 remaining after the reaction is consumed by the plant scrubber system. The plant thermal oxidizer system suppresses emission of SO2 to the atmosphere. Nitrogen (N2) is used to purge the SO2 delivery lines from the reactor back to the storage vessel.\n     Like the ammonia, the major amount of SO2 onsite is contained in a 250 psig rated storage vessel. The SO2 in the storage tank is blanketed with N2 to exclude oxygen. The N2 blanket pressure and ambient pressure of SO2 are well below the storage tank's rated pressure. Like the reactor, the SO2 storage tank is protected from a potential catastrophic release by safety relief devices. The tank is also inspected by an outside source every three years. \n     Like the ammonia tank, the SO2 storage tank is loaded from a delivery truck by the use of a closed loop recycle system between the storage tank and the delivery truck to prevent emissions of SO2 to the atmosphere. Plant process operators, supervisors, and delivery truck drivers have been formally trained in the safe handling and loading/unloading of SO2. Operator training is conducted on a yearly basis. A process hazard analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the SO2 storage and batch reaction systems.",

      "SummaryText": " are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The plant PSM program incorporates all of the PSM elements identified in the regulation. The standards and procedures developed for the PSM program are applied uniformly in the plant to both PSM covered processes and other chemical processes to ensure that the plant is operated safely. The plant operations have also incorporated the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68 accidental release prevention program into plant operational procedures and practices. The processes at Champion have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Section 7 of the RMP describes existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility. The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at Champion. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nChampion has implemented a written emergency response plan to handle accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including bringing releases under control (when feasible), adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response. The emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Ector County Local Emergency Planning Committee (L"
