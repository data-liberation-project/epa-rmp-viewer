      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary: \n\nAirgas USA, L.P. an Air Liquide Company (Airgas - Airgas Merchant Gases) operates a stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system in the liquid production and distribution of carbon dioxide (CO2) with approximately thirty-two (32) employees in Augusta, GA. The Augusta refrigeration process stores approximately 6,000 lbs. of liquefied ammonia under pressure in the main receiver (storage vessel).  Between this vessel, all connected piping, compression, condensers and related processes involved in the facility, there is a total amount of 23,000 lbs. anhydrous ammonia in the covered process.  The covered process exceeds the listed regulatory threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs. for anhydrous ammonia and is subject to chemical accident prevention provisions. \n\nRegulated Chemical: \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, presented in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68) (the RMP Rule). Anhydrous ammonia is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration process safety management program presented in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119 (OSHA PSM), as well as the federal RMP Rule.  Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions the Augusta plant is a Level 3 facility. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nThe highly toxic nature of ammonia in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Airgas policy is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This executive summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program.  Airgas has also im"

The following are examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Detection - Ammonia detectors located around the facility to detect and alarm. (2) Release Mitigation - Personal protective equipment; e.g., personal gas detectors, protective outerwear clothing, safety goggles, shoes, etc. (3) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provide isolation for ammonia process equipment, check valves on ammonia loading lines and pressure safety valves for the process piping and vessels. (4) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialist, Airgas Ammonia Division, to support the Augusta plant emergency action plan. \n\nEmployee Participation (EP): \n\nAirgas has developed a written plan of action and Augusta employee/operators are expected to participate in the accidental release prevention program (RMP/PSM). Employees are trained on and provided access to the ammonia refrigeration process safety information. Specific actions of employee involvement in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation.  Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are current, accurate and recommend any necessary changes. \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI): \n\nAirgas keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.

The Facility Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is kept accurate and is readily accessible as part of the written employee participation. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): \n\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC).  The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process. For future PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Airgas action item database tracking system.  The facility manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure. \n\nOperating Procedures (OP): \n\nAirgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous ammonia process operations, such as: (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal operations; (3) unit temporary operations; (4) unit emergency shutdown; (5) unit emergency operations; (6) unit normal shutdown and; (7) unit startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown.

These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate by the facility manager. \n\nTraining (TN): \n\nAirgas has implemented a training program for all employee/operators involved in the ammonia covered process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as: general orientation, facility rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.  In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years.  Local training requirements are documented and tracked on a local training matrix and corporate training requirements are tracked electronically in the Airgas University training system. \n\nMechanical Integrity (MI): \n\nAirgas has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on preventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves and vent systems, controls and interlocks, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Airgas documents incident and subsequent investigation, follows up actions, and closure in an electronic document control system.  The Facility Manager is responsible for maintaining a log and tracking incidents and corrective actions through completion.

The plan outlines action to be taken at the plant by personnel and visitor/contractors if an ammonia leak occurs, large or small.  Plant employee/operators will not respond directly to an ammonia leak and attempt to mitigate a release.  Instead they will support and communicate with emergency responders, local response agencies, and provide outside agency notification in the event of an ammonia release.  The emergency action plan provides for the evacuation of Augusta facility personnel and visitors.  \n\nThe Airgas Augusta facility has provided their emergency action plan to and coordinates the plan annually with the Augusta Fire Station.  Should an emergency involving the release of ammonia occur that will have off-site consequences, Airgas will contact the Augusta Fire Department and local support authorities, who will coordinate appropriate action for the affected community. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\nSafety is an inherent part of the culture at Airgas and enhancements in safety and operations are actively discussed and supported.
