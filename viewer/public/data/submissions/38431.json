The owners,Managment,and Employees of Nichols Agriservice LLC., Nichols Iowa are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, The facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department,LEPC, or other authorities, to migrate any release and to minimze the impact of the release on people and the enviroment. Our company policy would be to shut off any emegency valves that is possible for us to get to. Evacute any persons in harmes way.\n\n  ll. Facility Information\n     A. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\n     B. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, and distributed for application on crops as fertilizer nutrients.\n\n     C. The maximum quanity stored would be 245,00 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank and in portable nurse tanks.*Note maximum quanity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size.\n\n lll. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n      A. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a ten minute time span. The maximum quanity released would be 132,600 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.06 miles.\n\n      B. The alternitive release scenario is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.59 miles.To keep mitigation to a minimum we would shutoff all emergency valves as possible,call fire department,and keep area evacuated.\n\n lv. The accidental release, prevention program.\n\n      A. The facility has implemented the provisions of the saftey requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61, published by the American National Standards Ins"
