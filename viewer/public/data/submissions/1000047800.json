In 2004, the MRSS also accepted wastewater from portions of Muncy Township and Muncy Creek Township.  The treatment plant is equipped with a chlorination facility to disinfect the effluent prior to discharge to the west branch of the Susquehanna River. The treatment plant is located at 216 Old Cement Road in Fairfield Township. The disinfection facilities include a chlorine cylinder room, which contains chlorine containers, chlorine scale, two (2) chlorinators, and various safety equipment, and a chlorine room which houses a rotameter, plant water hydro-pneumatic tank, plant water strainer system and various safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is three (3) one (1)-ton containers with one in use.  The treatment facility is manned during normal business hours including occasionally during the weekend period.  Twenty-four (24) hour alarm notification from a chlorine monitor in the chlorine cylinder storage room is part of the system's automatic alarm process.  The operators visit the disinfection facility on at least a daily basis and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.\n\n\n\nThe LCWSA's accidental release prevention and emergency response program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\n\n* Training of the operators.\n\n* Preventive maintenance program.\n\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\n* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\n* Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n\n* Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\n* Local Agency Interaction: Montoursville Volunteer Fire Company.\n\n\n\nCh"

      "SummaryText": "emical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors.  Engineering and administrative controls are designed for early detection and response.\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program developed through an Integrated Contingency Plan which incorporates multiple regulatory requirements including Emergency Response, Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency Plan, Spill Prevention, Emergency Action Plan, etc which has been coordinated \\with the Lycoming County Department of Public Safety.  This program includes an emergency response assessment, emergency response management structure, and a notification plan.  \n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to train personnel on the procedures and hazards of the chlorine system and will continue to develop scenarios for table top exercises to assure appropriate actions are taken in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n"
