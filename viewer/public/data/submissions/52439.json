The plant is operated by the Otay Water District (OWD). Both the California Accidental Release Prevention (CALARP) Program satisfies the requirements of the County and the Federal RMP regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act. \n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility uses chlorine in excess of the threshold quantities under 40 CFR Part 68 and Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). Based on the amount of Regulated Substances (RSs) handled at the facility and the facility?s Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, the facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\n\nThe satisfy the RMP submission requirements, this five-year update is being submitted by OWD. OWD is also submitting a RMP as required under the Federal guideline using Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) ?RMP Submit 2004? software program. The program summarizes the processes involving the RS handled at the facility and the potential hazards associated with the handling of the RS. The approach and technical evaluation methods used to review the RS-handling processes and mitigate the potential hazards are also presented.\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility has not had and incidents or accidents during the last five years involving RSs. A Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and Seismic Assessment were completed during the initial submittal of the RMP in June of 1999. There have been no processes changes that require another PHA, OCA, or Seismic Assessment be conducted. These documents have been reviewed and are still considered adequate for the facility. \n\nThe "

      "SummaryText": "RMP consists of the following elements:\n\n- Hazard Assessment, including a worst case analysis, and alternative release analysis, and a five-year accident history (as of June 15, 2004 there have been ?zero? incidents);\n- Management Program: including a document management system;\nPrevention Program: including process safety information, a process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, maintenance programs, incident investigation programs, documentation of compliance audits, management of change procedures, pre-startup review, contractor requirements, employee participation programs, and hot work permit requirements; and\n- Emergency Response Program: including biweekly drills for the emergency response team.\n\nA major part of the OWD commitment is to continue to operate the facility without incident.  The management programs that are in place, protect both the workers at the facility and the public and are strictly adhered too. The facility has implemented detailed training, maintenance, and inspection programs that serve to prevent releases of an RS.  OWD has an onsite HAWOPER team and emergency response procedures to stop leaks and quickly repair equipment to avoid offsite consequences. \n\nThis RMP and CalARP Program documents all the required information and provides a summary of the OWD?s plans and programs to manage risk associated with the handling of chlorine at the Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facillity.\n\nA site security plan is available on a need to know basis at the site.
