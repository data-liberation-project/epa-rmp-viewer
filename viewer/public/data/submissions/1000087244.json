To accomplish this goal PCI manages risk through processes including, but not limited to, equipment/process design, safety inspections, employee training, HAZOP's, management of change, and emergency drills.  The Pasadena Plant's Emergency Preparedness Manual delineates roles and responsibilities during plant emergencies.  The Emergency Preparedness manual also summarizes and documents the Pasadena facility's policies regarding accidental chemical releases and emergency responses.\n\n\n\nPCI's Pasadena facility is located in Harris County on the South shore of the Houston Ship Channel at 2001 Jackson Road, Pasadena, Texas 77506.  This facility manufactures sulfuric acid, and ammonium thiosulfate (ATS, a liquid fertilizer) and ammonium sulfate (AS, a granular fertilizer).  Anhydrous ammonia, an important plant nutrient used in the manufacture of fertilizers, and chlorine, used for water treatment, are the only substances at this facility that satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68 Subpart F.  PCI has two covered processes at the Pasadena facility, ammonia storage and usage in fertilizer production; and chlorine storage and usage at the CIWA water treatment area, the sulfuric acid plant cooling tower, the potable water system, and the Cogen cooling tower.  PCI has one prevention program for all covered processes at the Pasadena facility.\n\n                                                                        \n\nRisk Management covers all aspects of a manufacturing facility from design and construction, through start-up and operation, to maintenance and training.  Accidental release prevention is an ongoing process requiring frequent monitoring and testing of equipment, management systems and people to ensure the safety of employees and the community and to protect the environment.\n\n\n\nIndustry engineering standard"

      "SummaryText": "s are used throughout design and construction.  Pre-startup reviews include a safety review to ensure compliance with all OSHA standards.  Safety audits include periodic HAZOP's and monthly safety inspections.  Operating procedures are kept current.  Management of change procedures are strictly followed to ensure all proposed changes to equipment, operating procedures and process conditions are thoroughly reviewed and receive management approval.  Safe work permits are routinely employed to assure maintenance activities are conducted properly and safely.  Pre-employment physicals include blood and urine testing for drugs and alcohol.  All employees receive classroom and on the job training prior to job assignment.  Monthly safety meetings and annual safety training are an integral part of the plant's accident prevention program.         \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a tank within a tank.  The tank is equipped with redundant level indication, one of which is remoted to a control room DCS and equipped with a high level alarm.  Plant policy limits the maximum storage level to 90% of design.  Emergency pressure relief valves are located on top of the storage tank to protect the vessel from excessive pressure.  Like the level indicator, the tank pressure indicator is remoted to a control room where both indicators are recorded on a 24-hour circular chart.  A vapor re-compression system eliminates routine venting from the tank.  Emergency power and air supply are available.  Interlocks, check valves, in line stack monitors, process area detectors and scrubbers provide additional protection against accidental releases.\n\n\n\nChlorine is used at the CIWA water treatment plant, sulfuric acid plant cooling tower, potable water system, and Cogen cooling tower to deter algae growth and to purify the water.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders at the CIWA treatment plant and SAP and Cogen cooling towers.  Total storage at each location does not exceed 2 cylinders or 4,00"

The cylinders are monitored through multiple daily operator rounds.\n\n\n\nDuring the past 5 years (April 2010 - March 2015) there has been 1 reportable release of ammonia meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42(a).  Due to faulty level transmitters the ammonia storage tank was overfilled during the unloading of an ammonia barge into it.  Although there was a temporary evacuation of the dock area of a nearby facility there were no reported or known deaths, injuries, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage either onsite or off-site.\n\n\n\nThe Plant's Emergency Response Program consists of a written Emergency Preparedness Manual that outlines roles and responsibilities during emergencies and gives response guidelines for different emergency situations that may occur at the Plant.  The Plant also conducts emergency drills for all employees on all shifts to test the Plant response and to improve the plan where necessary.  The Plant also maintains an emergency response team with coverage around the clock.  The team is trained and equipped to handle fires, rescues and HAZMAT incidents.  \n\n\n\nThe Plant has a number of processes in place to provide for the continuous improvement of safety.  Safety policies and procedures are reviewed and updated regularly.  New policies and procedures are developed, as necessary.  Safety training is conducted for all employees monthly.  All accidents and incidents are investigated, and results reviewed and tracked.  An annual program evaluation is written with an action plan for improvement.  An employee safety committee meets monthly to discuss current safety issues and to address any safety concerns.  Specific changes designed to improve Plant safety are summarized in the PCI Safety Plan.\n\n\n\n"
