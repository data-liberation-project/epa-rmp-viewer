This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses disinfection of drinking water.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the drinking water.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8000.00 lb.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorination of water.  In this scenario 8000 lb. of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 55 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 4.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine inv"

The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 20 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.2 miles.\n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility will take all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that will be in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant will maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the MI College Water Treatment Plant will maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures will address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information will be regularly reviewed and made readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant will institute a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training will be provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant will carry"

Process equipment examined by these checks will include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations will be carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel will be offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks will be corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures will be in place at the MI College Water Treatment Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks would be affected by a modification in process conditions will be made aware of the change and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at the MI College Water Treatment Plant. These reviews will be conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant will promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations will identify the situation leading to the incident as we"

All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees will be strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees will have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor will be carried out. The MI College Water Treatment Plant will have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors will be informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\n\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant has no accident history as the plant has not been completed.  \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe MI College Water Treatment Plant will develop a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan will include all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment will be regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan will be updated promptly to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nClay County EPC"
