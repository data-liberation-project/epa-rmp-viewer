The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe facility worst-case scenario is for Acrylonitrile.  The quantity is 2,600,000 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of the largest storage tank.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.  Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.  Additionally the LEPC is provided information for administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for this scenario.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe facility alternate case scenario(s) are for Acrylonitrile (toxic).  The toxic quantity is 1,000 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of a loading hose.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.
