      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for P Chem, Inc.\n\n1.  Facility Policy:  We at P Chem, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.    Should an accidental release occur, P Chem, Inc. has worked with the local fire department so they can plan for a response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:  P Chem, Inc. primary activities are chemical manufacturing.  We have 2 two regulated substances at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde(solution). Ammonia is stored at our facility in quantities greater than the threshold limits.  It is used for phosphonic acid production and neutralizations.  Formaldehyde (solution) is stored at our facility in quantities greater than the threshold limits.  It is used for phosphonic acid and triazine production.  \n\n3.
