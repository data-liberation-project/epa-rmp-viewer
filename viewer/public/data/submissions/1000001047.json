In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  DGC health and safety procedures ensure that emergency response facility personnel are well trained through the use of an extensive in-house and off-site training program.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCritical valves for the 1400, 4400, and 6000 plant operation ammonia refrigeration system were identified in March 2004.  The valves were identified using the following criteria:  any valve, which if operated incorrectly alone or in conjunction with others could cause personal injury, equipment loss, a release of ammonia, or any valve that is not routinely used and must have refresher training before use.  Critical valve labeling was completed by September 2004.\r\n\r\nBefore EPA adopted the new RMP regulation, DGC took proactive steps upon initial ownership to ensure worker safety and protection of the public and environment by implementing policies concerning health, safety, and environment.  The existing DGC Emergency Response Plan was modified to conform with the requirements of Section 112A of the CAAA.  Changes to the existing Emergency Response Plan primarily involved performing a new Hazard Assessment and putting the existing Emergency Response Program and OSHA Process Safety Mangement Program into Section 112A format.

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary activities of the Synfuels Plant encompass the manufacture of synthetic natural gas (SNG) and other byproducts from lignite coal using Lurgi gasification technology.  The SNG production rate is approximately 170 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).  The Synfuels Plant also generates, sells, and ships a number of other products, including anhydrous ammonia.  The Synfuels Plant has ammonia storage facilities as well as loading and unloading facilities.\r\n\r\nThe substances present at the Synfuels Plant in quantities above applicable thresholds and regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP), Section 112A&reg;, of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 are ammonia and flammable-gas mixtures containing various concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen.  The maximum inventories of Section 112A&reg; substances at the Synfuels Plant are approximately 150 million pounds of ammonia and approximately 223 thousand pounds of flammable-gas mixtures. The ammonia inventory was increased due to a new additional ammonia refrigerated storage system being constructed.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia is sold as a fertilizer and used in the refrigeration systems and in the production of ammonium sulfate. The flammable gas mixtures are used in the manufacturing of SNG as well as the gas feed for the ammonia production facility.\r\n\r\nThe hazard assessment for the Synfuels Plant included computer analyses of potential releases from nine flammable-gas mixture process areas and three ammonia process areas to estimate the potential distance to explosion endpoints and toxic endpoints, respectively.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Synfuels Plant has complied with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards and implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  Process equipment and retrofits are designed to applicable ASME and ASCE codes.  A number of processes at the facility are subject to CFR 1910.119.  The Synfuels Plant is also subject to the Emergency Preparedness Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), Section 302, notification requirements.  The facility is fully compliant with each of the applicable health, safety, and environmental programs.  The Chemical Release Prevention Program addresses areas such as process design (redundancy, safety interlocks, process controls such as flares, and spare equipment), procedures (operating, inspection, preventive maintenance, and predictive monitoring), and training (operating procedures and testing of technicians).
