Affected personnel are trained on the changes to the emergency response program.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is coordinated with the Tulsa County - Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills and involves both first responding groups as well as local community partners in emergency planning activities. The HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery maintains an in-house trained group for initial response for fires or emergencies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery resolves all significant findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes are examples of planned future risk reduction projects:\n\n1. Improvements to emergency isolation valves\n2. Improvements to fire protection systems\n3. Improvements to heater safety systems\n4. Improvements to relief valve protection\n5. Improvements to instrumentation systems\n6. Improvements to gas detection systems\n7. Improvements to operator shelters\n\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is resolved to have a program of continued improvement for safety, reliability, and risk reduction investments. For example, various new installations over the last five years (2019-2024) have resulted in spending about $183,800,000 for East and West site projects improving safety, reliability, and fire protection."

      "SummaryText": "d additional power outages shut down the air compressor at the East Boiler House. The backup steam-driven compressors failed to come online, resulting in loss of instrument air and all three boilers which did not allow the full shutting down of units in the East facility. The lack of utilities allowed excess flaring and atmospheric RV releases of RMP-regulated flammable mixtures at the FCCU and CDU, but it appears that the only offsite effects were caused by the non-RMP-regulated heavy gas oil that was released from the steam muffler and carried by strong winds onto cars and houses offsite. Although it was necessary to clean the affected cars and houses, no claims of property damage were made that required any repair beyond cleaning. Additional details are included in Section 6 of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery f"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\n\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive electronic computer system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemical technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.

This program includes (1) formal in-unit training, (2) classroom training, (3) on the job training, (4) self-study training, and (5) testing. The program could take up to 36 months to complete depending on the experience level of hired employees. Personnel with experience in the refinery or related industry may receive credit towards the completion of the training program.\n\nDuring the training program, each trainee must successfully complete all facets of the program which include; (1) basic refinery training, (2) off the job related studies, (3) job specific training, (4) testing (written & skill demonstration), and (5) qualifying on a set number of jobs at the assigned unit. Each trainee must attend all required safety training and meet minimum requirements in supervisory evaluations every six months to remain employed. After successfully completing the trainee program, the employee will have adequate knowledge to perform the duties of the assigned jobs at the assigned process unit within the refinery.\n\nIn addition, all operators are recertified every three years in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA 40 CFR 68. This recertification process includes (1) any necessary refresher training, (2) written testing, and (3) skill demonstrations.

The facility Mechanical Integrity Program includes: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) safety and health hazards, (2) applicable maintenance procedures, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices to ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.\n\nInspections and equipment tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax, and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has multiple flammable mixtures that include the following RMP-regulated flammables; methane, ethane, propane, propylene, isobutane, butane, butene, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, ethylene, and hydrogen. The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting. Each of the refinery's process units containing RMP-covered flammable materials above the threshold quantity are considered individual covered processes.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each applicable OSHA PSM element and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery encourages employees to partici"
