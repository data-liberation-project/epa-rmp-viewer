The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations. \n\nWPS has adopted a ?non-responding facility? policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submission of appropriate Reports and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  \n\nWPS policy also includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  The company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training.\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe WPS-Yuma Shop was previously known as Central Refrigeration Services, Inc. which is 100% owned by WPS.  The WPS-Yuma Shop is an ammonia refrigeration service center owned and operated by WPS.  WPS provides ammonia refrigeration ser"

The first of the two storage vessels was placed on-site in 1988.  The second vessel was acquired in 1994.\n\nAccess to the tanks is limited by fenced enclosure of the property.  The tanks are in a protected area, covered with shade to minimize the exposure to radiant heat from sunlight.  Traffic barriers are in place to discourage vehicle traffic at the tanks.  In 1997 a water system was installed to help cool the tanks on extremely hot days (120 degrees F+) which provides effective evaporative cooling of the tank skin which reduces the pressure in the vessel.\n\nProduce growing and shipping is a seasonal event in Yuma.  Typically the fresh vegetables come into season in early November and finish in April.  When cooling equipment is taken out of service in the spring the refrigerant is transferred out of that equipment and stored in the vessels at Yuma Shop.  The storage vessels are rated at a higher pressure than the nominal refrigeration systems that the refrigerant is drawn from.  The vessels are rated for ammonia service, and are equipped with isolation and Pressure Relief Valves installed in accordance with applicable codes. The only Regulated Substance stored is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  \n \n1.3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of the Storage Facility operation.  The facility does not qualify for the PSM Program (>10,000 lbs NH3) during the busy season, which lasts from Fall until Spring (approximately 9-10 months).  At that time the ammonia is being used i"

The written PSM document is maintained in the site RMP binder.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccess to the tanks is limited by fenced enclosure of the property.  The tanks are in a protected area, covered with shade to minimize the exposure to radiant heat from sunlight.  Traffic barriers are in place to discourage vehicle traffic at the tanks.  In 1997 a water system was installed to help cool the tanks on extremely hot days (120 degrees F+) which provides effective evaporative cooling of the tank skin which reduces the pressure in the vessel.  Pressure Relief Valves are installed on the vessels per the applicable codes.\n\nMaintenance is performed on the vessels while they are empty.  New pressure relief valves are scheduled for installation every 5 years per industry standards.   A vapor compressor and 4-way valve system provides the means to transfer refrigerant to / from the vessels.  The compressor and hose system is inspected for damage and wear and tear regularly.  Locked storage for transfer hoses was added 1/2004.\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at WPS - Yuma Shop:\n\n?Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals etc.  Training is documented through the ?Personal Qualifications Standard? booklet, which is in each employees training record file.\n?Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n?WPS participated as observers in a Yuma Country LEPC disaster training exercise in February 1994 and provided training for the Rural Metro Fire Department in 1996 regarding response to illegal drug manufacturing labs using ammonia as part of the drug production process.

      "SummaryText": "itional Emergency Response coordination was initiated with Yuma County /City Div. of Emergency Management in February 2004.\n?The storage vessel system at WPS/Yuma Shop differs from other storage systems (fertilizer terminals) in this way.  The transfer activity takes place during a few weeks per year whereas a typical terminal will have daily transfer activity.  WPS feels that this minimum number of transfers provide a reduction to risk and exposure.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel are trained to notify and evacuate via the Emergency Action Plan.  Only the Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be provided by WPS personnel (Ammonia Technicians) trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.   Written ammonia emergency response procedures are detailed in the WPS ?Thirty Minute Plan?.  Written plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.  Emergency Response equipment is maintained on site.\n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n?Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update    ;\n?Compliance Audits;\n?Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n?Triennial IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections;\n?WPS Inspection Protocol\n\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.  Work Orders are established in parallel to identified needs.  Current planned changes to improve safety include:\n\n?Update and upgrade of the RMP/PSM Documents;\n?RMP/PSM Training;\n?Improved/updated SOP?s;\n?Improved tagging and documentation of process valves;\n?Improved labeling of process "
