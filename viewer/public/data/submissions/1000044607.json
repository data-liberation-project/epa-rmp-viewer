      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n The Idaho Falls Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) uses compressed gaseous chlorine to disinfect wastewater and provide disinfected water discharges to the environment and irrigation uses. Storing large quantities of chlorine can be hazardous; therefore the WPCP takes its safety obligations in storing and using chlorine seriously providing safe, disinfected water to the environment. The following document describes what could happen in the event of an accident, the steps the WPCP takes everyday to ensure safe operation, and what to do in event of an emergency. Please contact David Smith at 208-612-8108 if you have any questions.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Idaho Falls WCPC and Idaho Falls Fire Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of Idaho and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThis document complies with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), Amendments of 1990 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. This document summarizes the WPCP's existing health and safety programs, internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The WPCP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases and which is designed to safeguard both on- and offsite people. To date, the WPCP has an excellent record in accident prevention.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\n\n\nThe Idaho Falls WPCP, operat"

The WPCP is on a 40 acre property about 3 miles south of the center of town and adjacent to Snake River. Wastewater from the Bonneville service area is treated at the WPCP, and the disinfected water is either discharged into the Snake River or reclaimed irrigation uses. The WPCP is designed for 17 million gallons per day (MGD), 35,000 lbs. BOD, and 38,000 lbs TSS.  It currently receives approximately 9.1 MGD, 19,000 lbs BOD, and 20,700 lbs TSS.\n\n\n\nUpon entering the plant, the wastewater passes through a pair of one-quarter inch diameter escalator punch plate screens.  The raw sewage is as screened using fine screening technology with an opening of approximately 6 millimeters.  The solids removed from the screens are washed to remove organic material, dewatered and compacted to remove the free water, and loaded into a storage dumpster.  All of the equipment and facilities are located indoors in the new Headworks Building to facilitate equipment operation and maintenance.  The screened material is landfilled.\n\nThe wastewater flows to an aerated grit chamber and then to the primary clarifier.  Floatables from the top of the clarifier as well as the settled sludge from the bottom are pumped into the primary digesters.  These digesters are of the anaerobic type and utilize the mesophillic temperature range for digestion and stabilization of sludge.\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the primary clarifier, the sewage flows to the secondary pump station where it is pumped over an activated biological filter tower.  This tower utilizes redwood media and the wastewater is passed over it at a rate in excess of 27 million gallons per day.  The purpose of the tower is to remove nutrients and act as a buffer to prevent shock loads from affecting the activated sludge system.\n\n\n\nUpon discharging from the tower, the wastewater enters the aeration basins.  The basins are of a compl"

These basins, together with the tower, provide an environment for higher bacterial life forms to develop. Normal detention time for the basins is about 5 hours under present flow conditions.\n\nFollowing aeration, the flow passes to the secondary clarifiers providing a resting stage where the microbial solids \"clump\" together and settle.  The settled solids return (underflow) to the secondary pumps station and remix with the primary effluent thus creating activated sludge.  A portion of this recirculated settled sludge is wasted daily to the solids handling building where two belt filter presses thicken the sludge. Sludge is then pumped to the primary digesters.\n\n\n\nAfter clarification, the wastewater (overflow) enters the chlorine contact chambers where it is disinfected with chlorine.  Following disinfection, the residual chlorine is neutralized with sodium bisulfite and discharged to the Snake River.\n\n\n\nFollowing anaerobic digestion, the sludge is further stabilized in a storage lagoon and  meets the Class B requirement set forth in 40CFR503 regulations.  It is used as a fertilizer and soil conditioner on farmland in the area.\n\n\n\nThe WPCP currently stores chlorine; a regulated toxic substances under the RMP regulations. Chlorine is stored in twelve, 1-ton steel containers containing a maximum of 12 tons of chlorine. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in both the RMP Rules and in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Rules (29 CFR 1910.119). However, because Idaho is not an OSHA-regulated State, the Idaho Falls WPCP is not subject to the PSM Rules.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to the WPCP in 1-ton containers. Current processes only allow gaseous chlorine to be withdrawn from the 1-ton containers. In both the Tank Room and the Chlorinator Room, chlorine leak detectors monitor continuously for chlorine lea"

In the event of a leak, the detectors sound an alarm at the plant control panel; additionally, the tank area has both an audible alarm and a flashing warning light inside and outside of the building. \n\n\n\nBoth the Tank and the Chlorinator Rooms are enclosed in the Chlorine Building. The Tank Room is equipped with an automatic chlorine scrubber ventilation system that automatically operates when chlorine is detected in the room. An emergency shower and eye wash station are provided on the outside of the building. Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) packs are available onsite in the Administration Building. The Chlorine Building has a fire sprinkler and fire alarm system in the event of a fire.\n\n\n\nThe WPCP entrance is controlled by a gate at Glen Koester Road. Visitors and contractors must enter the administration building and be approved by WPCP staff prior to entry into the WPCP. The WPCP is staffed year-round, 24 hours a day. \n\n\n\nBack-up power is available to the chlorination and dechlorination facilities in the event of an emergency. The back-up generator starts within seconds of electrical power supply loss and supplies power to critical processes within the WPCP, including the chlorine leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chlorine-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThe WPCP has a thorough Safety Management Program. Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of SCBA, worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine supplies; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine; and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\n\nThe WPCP Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?

Information found during the investigation is reviewed with affected staff, added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures, and passed onto the training unit for their inclusion in existing training programs if warranted to prevent a future event.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History Summary\n\n\n\nDuring the last 5 years, there were no reportable accidents at the WPCP that caused onsite injuries, deaths, offsite injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.
