FACILITY POLICY.  The owners, management and employees of River Valley Ag are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Nodaway County LEPC, local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION. The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received in nurse tanks from our bulk storage area and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmer.  The maximum  quantity stored in this area would be 180,000 pounds in our nurse tanks.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a nurse tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 4,300 pounds which represents the volume of individual tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.8 miles.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from 1\" transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the faci"

Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n     1.  Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, \n          the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n         The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424-8802\n\n     2.  At the earliest practical moment after discovery (within 24 hours) and determining the amount \n          of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n          The Missouri Department of Natural Resources @ 573/634-2436\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess our prevention and safety programs.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations  at this time.\n\n9.
