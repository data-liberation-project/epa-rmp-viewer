It utilizes approximately 15 lbs. of gaseous chlorine per day.  Chlorine is stored in 150 lb. cylinders as liquified chlorine under pressure.  The storage facility is designed to contain chlorine leaks by creating anegative draft through a totally enclosed room and scrubbing the vented gas through a caustic soda air scrubber.  The scrubber is designed to reduce chlorine concentration to less than 1 ppm.  In the event of the failure of the automatic containment system, manual backup is provided or facility staff are trained to contain leaks and minimize any release.
