As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be Trinity Regional Medical Center and the Iowa Highway Patrol.  The Ft. Dodge Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.

KNC\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKNC\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response P"

These high standards include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped minimize the severity of chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tMinimizing the possibility of interrupting the combustion of ammonia vapors in the flare by having a continuous pilot in the flare.  \n\u00c2\u00b7\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) in place.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tInstalling chlorine detectors at the chlorine use area to help ensure that a chlorine release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tInstalling \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfsmart hoses\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf in the loading area that seal off in the event of a hose rupture.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tRequiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tManning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all loading operations.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tProviding emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in"
