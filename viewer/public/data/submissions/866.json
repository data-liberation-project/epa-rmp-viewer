If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Shell Rock Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  This facility is a farmers coop.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers for fertilizer.  The storage tank consists of 30,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are schools, residences,  public recreational areas, and businesses within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 1581.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system is designed,installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA (29CFR 1910.111).  We have never had an accident involving ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia tank, it is our policy to notify the Shell Rock Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department: members of the fire department have inspected our ammonia tank.  There has not been any plans to improve the safety program."
