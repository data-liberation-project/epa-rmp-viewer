This regulation requires facilities that store listed toxic or flammable substances in excess of listed threshold quantities, as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.130, to evaluate potential impacts of an accidental chemical release, and develop and submit a formal RMP to the USEPA, as well as state and local agencies as applicable. The RMP rule is divided into three program levels (1, 2 and 3), which are based on potential off-site impacts on neighboring schools, residential areas, and other structures of public occupation.\n\nThe Diversey Kentucky Warehouse Facility, operated by GXO Logistics, is regulated under Program 1 rule requirements as stated in 40 CFR Part 68.10 because:\n\n\u0095\tDiversey potentially maintains storage inventories of flammable substances in aerosol containers in various capacities, at ambient conditions, in excess of the RMP threshold quantity 10,000 pounds established for these flammable substances.
