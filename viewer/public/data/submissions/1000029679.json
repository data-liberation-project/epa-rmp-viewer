(FC) accidental release prevention policy involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the Iowa Fertilizer Law are adhered to. The FC emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\n2. The FC facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. This location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical panels, lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.  This facility is also used for the purpose of parking and storing a varying number of anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks. The facility is manned year round during normal business hours.\n\n\n\n3. FC's accidental release prevention plan is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Semi-annual training of all personnel required to handle ammonia and what to do in an emergency - training documented on RCI.\n\n* Facilities constructed and maintained according to the Iowa Fertilizer Law\n\n* Use of usual anhydrous ammonia safety equipment\n\n* Inspections by IDALS of storage tanks, piping for leaks, nurse tanks, applicators, transfer risers, riser hoses, safety equipment, pressure relief valve records, etc.\n\n\n\n4. No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. This facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the local Fire Department, which is also under the jurisdiction of the North Central Emergency Planning District in Iowa. This program includes response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency operations and response procedures are reviewed annually, with a site visit of the facility by"
