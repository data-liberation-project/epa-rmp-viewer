      "SummaryText": "Brumbaugh, Inc. located at 614 Birch Lane Taylor, MO is a farm supply store offering for sale inputs for production agriculture.  These inputs for sale include: Anhydrouse Ammonia (NH3), Dry Fertilizer, Liquid Fertilizer, Pesticides, Seed, and Custom Application Services.  Safety at the facility is a top priority.  A walk around visual inspection is done daily to make sure everything is in its proper place and nothing out of the ordinary has occurred.  If a problem is noticed it is taken care of immediately.  Brumbaugh, Inc. is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Managemant (PSM) Standard and also subject to EPCRA section 302.    Brumbaugh, Inc. is required to comply with the State of Missouri Department of Agriculture Division of Weights and Measures which performs periodic inspections of the bulk tank and nurse tanks.  Safety equipment is readily available and required to be used when handling Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nThe chemical for which Brumbaugh, Inc. is submmitting a Risk Managemnet Program for is Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3).  Brumbaugh, Inc. has 1 large stoage tank with a capacity of 26,000 gallons.  By company policy the maximum this tank is ever filled to is 85% which is equal to 22,100 gallon.  According to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) anhydrous ammonia weighs 5.14 pounds per gallon at 60' F.  Thus the maximum amount on hand in the storage tank at one time is 113,594 pounds or rounded off to 110,000 pounds which was the amount used in the worst-case scenario consequence analysis on RMP* Comp.  A worst case scenario is unlikely to happen because of pressure relief valves, excess flow valves, and emergency shut off valves that are in place.  Brumbaugh, Inc. also has 28 nurse tanks that are 1,000 gallon capacity each.  These nurse tanks are filled from the big 26,000 gallon stoarge tank.  Nurse tanks are filled to a maximum of 85% on the gauge which equals 4,370 pounds.  Loaded nurse tanks are picked up by area farmers and taken to their fields and the appli"

      "SummaryText": "cation of anhydrous ammonia serves as a source of nitrogen for their corn.  For the RMP alternative case scenario the pulling away of a nurse tank that is still attached to the big storage tank via transfer hoses was determined to be the most likely accident to occur.  The reason this scenario was chosen was because during the busy season farmers tend to sometimes get in a hurry and not be as cautious as they should be.  Should an accident such as the driving off with a nurse tank loaded with anhydrous ammomia while still attached to the big storage tank via transfer hoses occur, mitigation measures are in place to minimize the release of anhydrous ammonia.  These measures include excess flow valves and emergency shut off valves which would stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia from releasing.\n\nDuring the last five years no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred.  Tanks, transfer hoses, safety valves, and equipment are kept up with proper maintenance.  Outdated hoses, valves, and equipment are replaced with new up to date items.  The bulk storage tank is kept locked up when not in use  to prevent valves from being tampered with.  \n\nShould an accident occur 911 would be called and the accident would be reported to the Palmyra, MO Fire Department who would then respond.  Employees of Brumbaugh, Inc. receive on the job training about the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Brumbaugh, Inc. requires the use of safety equipment by its employees when working with anhydrous ammonia.  Farmers that purchase anhydrous ammonia from Brumbaugh, Inc. are also given safety equipment such as gloves and goggles and are told to be sure and use them for their own protection."
