If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer for retail sale to farmers.\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 132,600 lbs in a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 130,000 pounds.\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n    The worst-case release scenario would be the total release of the contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes the maximum quantity released would be 132,600 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion) is 5.6 miles\n\n    The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The estimated quantity released would be 400 pounds, The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion) is 0.1 mile.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
