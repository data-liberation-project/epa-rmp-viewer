THE FACILTITY POLICY:  The owners, management of Augusta Farmers Co-op Co.are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintanance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distrubuted for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quanity stored would be 80000 pounds in the facility's 1 tank.\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank (80000 pounds) released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company prodcedures. The distance to the endpoint of dipersion based of the model used is .94 miles.\n    THE ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO is assumed to be a release from the of a one inch transfer hose with 3500 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to endpoiint of dispersion is .42 miles.\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM: the facility complies with the rules and reguoations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities. These reglulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910,111 regarding storage and handling of anhydous ammonia.\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the coverd process in the past five years that have cau"
