LES is a publicly owned electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska. As a public owned utility, LES operates and maintains all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with the expectations of LES customers and owners. LES strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of LES business practices and by maintaining this Risk Management Program, LES is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it. LES is committed to the accidental release prevention program and also maintains a detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for the Rokeby Generating Station. This plan is routinely reviewed with HAZMAT responder organizations.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Rokeby Station provides emergency, peaking, and base load electric power generation by utilizing one or more of the three dual fuel combustion turbines, two diesel blackstart engines, and one fuel oil storage tank located on the 160-acre site. To augment power output during high summer air temperatures, a cooling system is used to lower turbine inlet air temperatures. The cooling system uses ammonia refrigeration to make ice that is stored in two separate concrete tanks and consists of Ice System #1 and Ice System #2. The total quantity of the anhydrous ammonia exceeds EPA\u2019s RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68."
