The terminal manager, operators, and senior management have a strong commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures. The facility maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan that complies with OSHA and EPA emergency response and release requirements which includes periodic safety training.\n\n\n\nFacility operations and the regulated substance handled \n\n\n\nDirect Fuels' current operation involves separation of fuel mixture (e.g., mainly mixtures containing gasoline, diesel and/or jet fuel) back into useable gasoline and diesel that is distributed back into the fuel market. The most common mixture separated is pipeline transportation mixture or \"transmix\" which is the fuel interface that forms when finished fuels are sequentially sent down pipelines from upstream refineries to local fuel distribution terminals.  Direct Fuels is introducing new process equipment and associated process changes to reduce total sulfur in their existing diesel stream.  Hydrogen (regulated RMP substance) is needed in the reactions that reduce sulfur and will be stored on-site and metered to the process as it is needed.\n\n    \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the following accidental release programs: OSHA PSM, EPA SPCC, EPA Emergency Action Plan, and OSHA Emergency Response.  The facility has coordinated the introduction new processes (including the presence of hydrogen) with the City of Fort Worth Fire Department, Fire Prevention Bureau.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history \n\n\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable release of a RMP substance in the last 5 years.  No release of any substance in the last 5 years has caused serious harm to employees or off-property persons.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program \n\n\n\nDirect Fuels emergency response program wil"
