      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Nalco Champion - Fresno Facility\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe safety of employees, company operations, and the public are facility management's most important objectives. The Nalco Champion Safety Policy states that the company is committed to providing the processes, facilities, standard training, discipline and work culture to ensure a safe work environment for all employees, safety for the communities in which we operate, safe competitive products for our customers and protection of shareholder assets. The Fresno Facility has developed a comprehensive operational program designed to minimize the potential for accidental releases and to facilitate effective response to accidental releases which includes protection of the public.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulatory Substances Handled\r\nThe Nalco Champion facility - located at 3130 FM 521 in Fresno, TX - is comprised of a manufacturing plant and global technology center. The manufacturing plant, which is the primary operation at the facility, utilizes batch chemical processing to produce industrial organic chemical products that are used primarily in the oil and gas industry. The plant is further divided into four smaller plants (each consisting of reactors and/or blenders) that utilize common auxiliary equipment and utilities. The plant is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round and full time security personnel are present at the facility.\r\n\r\nRaw materials, including intermediates, are brought into the plant in containers (super-sacks, bags, totes, or drums), railcars, and tank-trucks. These materials are then transferred into storage tanks or warehoused until needed for product manufacture. The following six RMP-regulated substances are present as raw materials:\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3) - Toxic regulated\r\nEthylene Oxide (EO) - Toxic regulated\r\nFormaldehyde (37% Solution) - Toxic regulated\r\nFormaldehyde (50% Solution) - Toxic"

Raw materials charged into a reactor undergo any combination of mixing, temperature, and/or pressure changes to form the desired product. Those raw materials charged to a blender do not undergo forced temperature or pressure changes to make a product.\r\n\r\nRaw material charging to a vessel is performed using various methods. Raw materials in storage tanks are piped directly to vessels or transferred to totes and drums at drop connections for charging into vessels via hose connections. Likewise, raw materials delivered to the plant in drums or totes are charged to a vessel through the use of hose connections. Dry raw materials in super-sacks are charged to vessels though vacuum systems, however, bags are poured into a vessel through the manway.\r\n\r\nAfter a product is manufactured, it will either be transferred into a tank-truck, a container (totes or drum), a storage tank, or to another reactor/blender acting as holding vessel. All products are eventually delivered to off-site customer locations or to other Nalco Champion plants as intermediates.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The plant's PSM program incorporates all of the PSM elements identified in the regulation. The standards and procedures developed for the PSM program are applied uniformly in the plant to both PSM covered processes and other chemical processes to ensure that the plant"

The plant operations have also incorporated the requirements of the 40 CFR Part 68 accidental release prevention program into plant operational procedures and practices.\r\n\r\nThe processes at Champion have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Section 7 of the RMP describes existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility. The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at Champion. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\nNalco Champion has implemented a written emergency response plan to handle accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including bringing releases under control (when feasible), adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response. The emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Fort Bend County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nAt all times there is at least one employee either on the facility premises or on-call (i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator is thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's emergency response plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and charac"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe Fresno Facility continues to improve safety through capital investments in facilities and technology to minimize and, where possible, eliminate the potential for releases (including improved perimeter controls and security). The plant is also a Responsible Care member and has developed a site-specific management system conforming to the RC14001 Management System standard which includes processes for managing safety, security, and community awareness and protection."
