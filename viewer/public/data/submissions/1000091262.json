In addition, personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus), fire suppression and extinguishing systems are available including automatic and manual systems in the truck loading and unloading areas and the LPG areas.\r\nAdditionally, Calumet maintains internal response capabilities with a paid-on-call response team that is trained in industrial firefighting, hazardous materials response and technical rescue. This team is trained in accordance with NFPA and OSHA standards and maintains a presence in the facility 24/7.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (40 CFR 68.155 (d) & 40 CR 68.42(b))\r\nCMR continues to strive to minimize the potential for any releases from our plant.  During the past five (5) years there has been one (1) release of note.  For the non-reportable incidents that have occurred CMR personnel responded swiftly to control and contain each release.  CMR investigates every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. FCC Fire (NAICS Code 32411)\r\nOn March 7, 2019 at 1:35 PM, a vapor cloud ignition occurred due to a release of liquid pressurized gases (LPGs), approximately 2,818 lbs.  The incident resulted from a burst pipe caused by extreme cold weather. It was extinguished in approximately 90 minutes, with minimal onsite impact.  Local responders closed nearby roads.  A precautionary shelter in place was executed offsite but ultimately no"

Offsite responders were standing by to provide back-up firefighting assistance.\r\nAir monitoring did not detect any environmental release either during or after the incident and no injuries were identified. Primary wind direction originated from the East at an average of 2.5 mph. CMR has conducted a survey to identify any lines or equipment which could be subject to failure due to extremely cold conditions.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE (40 CFR 68.155 (e))\r\nCMR maintains an Emergency Response Plan that is coordinated with the City of Great Falls Fire and Rescue Department to provide a carefully planned and effective response effort. CMR employees are also trained in emergency response to incidents involving hazardous substances and drills are conducted periodically to ensure that the emergency response teams can mitigate the effects from a release.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (40 CFR 68.155 (f))\r\nCMR continues to invest resources in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  Continuous implementation of CMR's Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) are designed to mitigate potential risks that may arise during the design stage through the useful life of the equipment and improve the safety performance of the facility."

Calumet Montana Refining, LLC (CMR) has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of our community, workers and protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in incident  prevention. Examples include: training personnel and promoting safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release. CMR has developed and continuously implements its Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) to mitigate potential risks throughout the useful life of its equipment. This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED (40 CFR 68.155 (b))\r\nCalumet Montana Refining, LLC operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (i.e., propane, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, asphalt products, ect.) from raw crude oil. The refinery handles several regulated flammables including propane, butane, isobutane, ethane, N-pentane, isopentane, ect. In addition, the refinery utilizes hydrofluoric acid which is a regulated toxic substance. These substances may exist in pure form or, more commonly, as part of mixtures in varying concentrations. After careful review, for the purpose of this plan, the Refinery operates three (3) covered processes. Calumet Montana Refining, LLC. has decided to modify their plan to include all process units as covered with the exception of our Emulsion Modified Asphalt Plan"

Calumet Montana Refining, LLC adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. The refinery has established programs based on OSHA PSM to evaluate and identify potential risk through management of change, mechanical integrity programs and process hazard assessments.\r\nActions to minimize potential releases are facilitated by having trained personnel who participate in the programs; the use of qualified contractors; utilizing controlled operating procedures, pre-start-up safety reviews, and established safe work practices. Incidents are investigated and compliance audits performed to periodically assess the programs.  Collectively, incident prevention program activities help prevent potential incident scenarios. In addition to the incident prevention program activities, process safety features exist on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\u00bf\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\u00bf\tHydrofluoric acid detectors with alarms\r\n\u00bf\tHydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms\r\n\u00bf\tPersonal hydrogen sulfide detectors worn while in the refinery.\r\nRelease Containment/Control \r\n\u00bf\tProcess relief va"
