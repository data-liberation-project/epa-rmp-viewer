This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Buckeye C02 Plant, located approximately 36/l00ths of a mile from the intersection of Texas Camp road and State Highway 8, in Lovington, New Mexico, operates a variety of processes to extract natural gas liquids from natural gas. The Buckeye C02 Plant has regulated flammables, including: Propane. Normal Butane, Isobutane. Ethane, and Methane.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Buckeye Gas Plant has two Program Level I processes, both flammable substances.\n\nThe first worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the Buckeye Gas Plant is a flammable mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGL's). A vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of NGLs, contained in a single vessel/storage tank is assumed to release and ignite. The total amount released would be 167,000 lbs. The maximum distance to 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 miles. The second scenario is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving 61,000 pounds of propane in storage. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.3 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating these WCS.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe foll"
