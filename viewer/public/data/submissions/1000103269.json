The following details the prevention program elements at The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1\tSafety Information\n\nThe DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n4.2\tHazard Review\n\nThe DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4\tTraining\n\nThe DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of the"

The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n2.0\tDescription of The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the treated water prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe DELCORA Western Regional Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated"
