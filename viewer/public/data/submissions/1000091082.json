      "SummaryText": "World Oil Refining is a 9500bpd crude oil processing facility that produces finished asphalt and unfinished petroleum distillates. The facility encompasses roughly 5 acres of land in South Gate, California. There are operations that occupy space on both east (9302) and west (9301) sides of Garfield Avenue.\n\nThe facility has developed a risk management program to address the EPA RMP requirements (40 CFR Part 68) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (19 CCR Division 2, Chapter 4.5).  World Oil Refining is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The World Oil Refining staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely distilling and storing the covered chemical, naphtha.\n\n \n\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nWorld Oil Refining has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the covered processes.  World Oil Refining's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n \n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe main operation at World Oil Refining is crude oil distillation. The facility uses atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation as the means to physically separate the crude oil into fractions. There are no chemical or catalytic reactions that take place within the process. Distillate products consist of full-range naphtha, diesel (sold as Light Distillate Oil or LDO), light vacuum gas oil (sold as LVGO) and heavy vacuum gas oil (combined with LVGO or sold as Cutter Stock for the bunker fuel market). The distillate products are loaded at the Distillate Loading Rack on the east side of Garfield Avenue. Vapors emitted"

These include a SulfaTreat Unit used to strip H2S from the gases coming off the Crude Unit, a Waste Water Treatment Plant that treats water generated from the process and routes it to the L.A. County Sanitation sewer system, a boiler that provides 200 psig steam for the plant and an incinerator (I-301) that is utilized to destroy off-gases from the SulfaTreat Unit, vapors from asphalt truck loading, vapors from the tank vent vapor recovery system and vapors from the Waste Water Treatment Plant. An oxidized roofing production plant or Air Blown Plant (AB Plant) is located within the refinery perimeter and consists of four separate vessels called stills, four seal pots (one for each still), mechanical blowers that deliver air to the process stills, and a caustic scrubbing unit to clean the off-gas from the AB Plant before it is sent to the incinerator (I-301). The roofing asphalt produced is shipped via pipeline and via truck.\n\n\n\nThe covered processing areas were determined to be as follows:\n\n-Crude & Vacuum Unit\n\n-Cooling Water System\n\n-Sulfur Removal & Treatment\n\n-Utilities\n\n-Air Blow Plant & Incinerator\n\n-Tank Farm & Loading/Unloading Racks\n\n\n\nWorld Oil Refining processes crude oil and hence handles all the hydrocarbons that comprise crude oil.  Thus, there are hazardous substances that are utilized in or generated by the process.  Based on the EPA definitions of flammable hydrocarbons, the quantities of the regulated flammable mixture in processing areas as well as at storage tanks at the facility should be determined. For the purpose of determining the worst-case release scenario, the largest quantity in the World Oil Refining facility was determined to be Naphtha with a TOTAL of 256,420 lbs. of Naphtha.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has designated two Covered Processes associated with Naphtha which are included in the Naphtha Process"
