              "Description": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe attached Registration contains a summary of the McLane Food Service administrative and operational programs to prevent ammonia-related accidents and reduce potential risks.  The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.  The following Data Elements sections are attached:\n\n\n\nSection 1:    Registration Information\n\nSection 2:    Toxics - Worst Case Release\n\nSection 3:    Toxics - Alternative Release\n\nSection 4:    Flammables - Worst Case Release (NOT APPLICABLE)\n\nSection 5:    Flammables - Alternative Release (NOT APPLICABLE)\n\nSection 6:    Five-Year Accident History\n\nSection 7:    Prevention Program 3 Component (NOT APPLICABLE)\n\nSection 8:    Prevention Program 2 Component \n\nSection 9:    Emergency Response Component\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Action Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers? documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe McLane Food Service facility is located at 7600 W. Roosevelt St. The facility is approximately .25 miles south of Interstate 10.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is both agricultural and industrial.\n\n\n\nThe McLane Food Service facility was constructed in 2015 with October 30, 2015 as the initial startup date. The primary business of this location is cold storage warehousing of food products. This system is designed to use 15,702 pounds of ammonia. In order to conduct operations, the system currently uses 12,893 pounds of ammonia in a single closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage of various food products.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nPrevention programs are in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\nEngineering Measures: It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization. The relief valves vent to a water diffusion tank designed to hold one gallon of water per pound of ammonia which could be release from the largest relief valve.\n\n\n\nThe engine room will be equipped with an ammonia detection system designed to alarm at a low level of 25 ppm and a high level of 300 ppm. \n\n\n\nEach cold storage room will be equipped with one or more ammonia detectors. These detectors will activate a visual and audible alarm inside and outside the room entrance at 25 ppm. In addition, at 25 ppm, the refrigeration controls will shut down the liquid feed solenoid valves to stop the flow of refrigerant into all air units in the affected room. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe McLane Food Service Roosevelt facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  \n\n\n\nThis Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince the facility startup, October 2015, there has been to reportable no accident history to report. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hazards Review was conducted November 23, 2015 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the McLane facility. The last PHA revalidation was performed on 10/27/2020.  In addition to recommendations from the Hazard Review, the facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through PSM team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n\n\n",
