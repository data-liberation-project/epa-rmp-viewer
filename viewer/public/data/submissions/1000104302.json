The Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the Plant District Safety and Training Officer to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n2.0 Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\nProgram Level: 3\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine\n\n3.0  Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatm"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Sangamon County Water Reclamation Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb.) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wa"

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* Physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n* Chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n* Operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n* Design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n* Specific chemical inventories.\n \nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  The Safety Officer is responsible for maintaining and updating this information, as needed.\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine and other chemicals used in our process.

These documents are used to:\n\n* Train employees,\n* Perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n* Help maintain the equipment.\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the Chlorination Process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant performed and will periodically update process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the Chlorination Process to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nTo perform the PHAs, Sangamon County Water Reclamation District Sugar Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.
