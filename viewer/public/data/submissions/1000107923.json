      "SummaryText": "FACILITY POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees of the Allnex USA, Inc., East St. Louis facility (Allnex) are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials through use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance, and training of all persons that work with hazardous materials.  The facility maintains an Emergency Response and Action Plan as required by 29 CFR 1910.120, and each employee that may come in contact with a hazardous material is trained to HAZWOPER, First Responder, Operations Level standard.   \n\nEmployees are trained on procedures for employee safety, evacuation, and immediate mitigation response to a chemical release.  However, the facility depends on external emergency responders, the City of East St. Louis, and/or third party vendors for more extensive response and cleanup if needed.   A site walk-through is offered to the East St. Louis Fire Department and Police Department on an annual basis, and copies of the facility's Contingency Plan are provided to local responders.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nAllnex manufactures industrial coating resins for a variety of industries under SIC code 2821.  The plant operates up to three shifts daily, with a maximum of about 35 people on site at one time (including hourly and salaried personnel).\n\nThe facility is located at 2904 Missouri Avenue, in an industrial/commercial area of East St. Louis, Illinois.  Automobile access is from Missouri Avenue, and the property consists of an office building, labs, production building, storage facilities, tank farms, and loading docks.   The majority of the area inside the facility's fenceline is paved with asphalt or concrete.   Approximately 90,000 square feet of indoor space is used for manufacturing, warehousing, laboratory, and office.   All production/reaction areas are located inside enclosed buildings.   The property is fully fenced and all gates are manned and/or locked to prevent unauthorized access."

      "SummaryText": "The only RMP-regulated chemical stored on site in quantity exceeding the regulatory threshold is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This material is used in the production of polyurethane resins and is stored in a warehouse in 55-gal drums.   These drums are transported by fork truck from the warehouse to the production area and moved into position using a drum dolly.   Transfer from the drum to the blending tanks is done through a closed venting system equipped with a vapor return system.\n\nAs stated above, TDI is purchased only in 55-gallon drums.    It has historically been stored in quantities below the 10,000-lb threshold for RMP.   However, due to production scheduling, shipping and delivery constraints, it may become necessary to store this material in larger quantities.  Therefore, this RMP is submitted to address incidents of TDI storage up to 30,000 lbs.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nAllnex has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario for release of TDI.  However, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as advised by the EPA.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility complies with accident and release prevention programs specified in the OSHA Process Safety Management rule in 29 CFR 1910.   These activities include Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for covered processes, HAZOP reviews, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs), and employee training.   The facility maintains a robust Management of Change program and Mechanical Integrity program.   Preventive Maintenance (PM) inspections are scheduled for SHE critical equipment as required, and the PHA for the TDI process was last updated in 2022. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years that resulted in release of TDI from this facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Response and Action Plan (the Plan) as required by 29 CFR 1910, and each employee that ma"

      "SummaryText": "y come in contact with a hazardous material is trained to HAZWOPER, First Responder, Operations Level standard.  All managers/supervisors are required to be familiar with the Plan and the procedures to follow in an emergency, and are to ensure their employees are also familiar with the Plan and with their responsibilities in an emergency.\n\nIn the event of very small spills of TDI, trained individuals wearing appropriate PPE will cover the spilled liquid with an absorbent material such as oil dry, then shovel it into an open top container.  This container will be moved to a safe location for neutralization, then the drum filled with an appropriate neutralizing solution and allowed to stand for at least 48 hours, and which point a lid may be placed on the drum.   The spill site may be washed down with neutralizing solution and tested for TDI vapors to ensure that the area is clean.\n\nNeutralizing solutions are mixtures of agents that react with TDI.   A typical decontaminating solution is a mixture of water and sodium carbonate with a small amount of liquid detergent.  The water and sodium carbonate react with TDI to form polyurea solids and CO2 gas.   A number of solutions are available, and may be selected based on ambient temperature, location, and flammability.  Solid neutralizers, which are a mixture of a neutralizing solution pre-mixed with absorbent, can also be purchased and may be used for quick cleanup of very small spills.   \n\nAs mentioned above, for a large release, Allnex would depend on first responders and/or third party contractors for extensive response and cleanup activities.\n\u00a0\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.    The facility has started Risk Analysis Surveys to address future concerns with containment systems, sewers, and tank integrity.   Additional SHE programs are being developed to implement RC14001 in 2024."
