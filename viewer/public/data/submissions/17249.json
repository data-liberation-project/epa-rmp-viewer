Safety is a most important aspect of the job, a requirement for employment at the facility, and considered by management as a business objective.\n\nThe facility is located in Rapid City, SD.  The one process at the facility uses methanol to yeild formaldehyde.  Formaldehyde is a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involved the release of formaldehyde into a diked area, developing from a mixer seal leak.  The quantity released is 1500 lbs., at a rate of 10 lbs/min.  The release duration is 150 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The topography is urban.  The RMP Comp program indicated a 3.0 mile distance to the endpoints.  The estimated population within the distance to the endpoint was 150.\n\nThe alternative worst case release scenario involved the release of formaldehyde into a diked area, developing from a leaking pipe.  The quantity released is 200 lbs., at a rate of 10 lbs/min.  The release duration is 20 minutes with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  The topography is urban.  The RMP Comp program indicated a 0.5 mile distance to the endpoints.  The estimated population within the distance to the endpoint was 50.\n\nSafety is maintained by training and safe operating practices.  Safe operations at the facilitiy are assured by the use of procedures.\n\nWithin the past five (5) years, the process had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program.  No injuries have been recorded in the past five (5) year period.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, and information for informing the public, and local agencies responding to accidental releases.  Emergency health care information is found in plant MSDS sheets.  The local fire and police departments will respond to emergencies.  Plant personnel will work with responders in"
