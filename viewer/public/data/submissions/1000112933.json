The purpose of the ERP is to ensure that proper preparation, response, recovery, and consequence mitigation procedures are in place for accidental releases of chlorine resulting from natural disaster, human error, equipment failure, or sabotage.  The goals of this program include the following:\n?\tProtect the public\u0092s health and the environment.\n?\tProtect the health of facility staff and contract employees.\n?\tProtect the health of local emergency response agency personnel.\n?\tCoordinate emergency response actions between the local emergency response agencies and facility staff.\n?\tProvide emergency response procedures to be followed by facility personnel during emergency situations.\n\nThere are no facilities employees designated or qualified to respond to an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance; therefore, the plant would be considered a non-responding facility by EPA standards. An incidental release which does not cause a potential safety or health hazard or that can be neutralized or controlled at the time of release by an on-site operator would not be considered an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. An Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility to address incidental releases. \n\nThe chlorine storage area are monitored by vapor detection units, which notify the facility operations company by auto-dialer in the event of an accidental release of chlorine. Additionally, an alarm and flashing light system alert on-site personnel to the presence of a chemical release.\n\nResponse coordination efforts have been made with the local Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission. \n\n9.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt this time there are no projects planned however, any significant change in the processes or equipment at the plant sha"

A statement of assurance from the Inframark RMP Manager regarding accidental releases at the Plant during the past five years is included in the plan.\n\nAn incident investigation will be completed and prepared for each accidental release that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted, in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The incident investigation report must be retained for a period of five years following the incident. A catastrophic release is classified as having caused at least one of the following:\n\n\u0095\tOn-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage (\u00a768.42a) or\n\u0095\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42a).\n\nThe RMP Manager is designated as the responsible party to conduct the required accidental release investigation and complete the appropriate documentation.

Therefore, default conditions as suggested by the EPA Risk Management Plan guidelines were used to determine the alternative release scenarios for chlorine.

According to EPA guidelines, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nChlorine Release\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine is determined using the EPA guidelines presented in the Risk Management Guide for Offsite Consequences Analysis. The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a single vessel would be released over a period of 10 minutes. For a 2,000-pound vessel, this calculates to a release rate of 200-lb/min. Other factors are taken into consideration in the determination of a toxic endpoint, including the terrain of the surrounding area (rural or urban), typical weather conditions and chemical density. The following factors were used in \u00b7the calculation of the toxic endpoint for this facility: Wind speed 1.5 m/s; Atmospheric Stability Class F; Temperature 25\u00b0; Humidity 50%; Urban Surface Roughness; Height of release 0-feet (ground level). For wastewater treatment plants, chlorine is always assumed to be dense gases which travel close to the ground surface. An urban surface roughness was chosen because there are many obstacles in the path of potential release, including trees and structures.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the plant was developed using the EPA\u0092s screening tool RMP*COMP, and the distance to a toxic endpoint for chlorine in an urban area is 0.9 miles at a release rate of 200-lb/min.
