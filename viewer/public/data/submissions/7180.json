We use a combination of an accidental release prevention program and an emergency response planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n     *    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management plan (RMP)\n           regulation.\n     *    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental\n           chemical releases.\n     *    An overview of our accidental release prevention program.\n     *    A five-year accident history for accidental release of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n     *    An overview of our emergency response program.\n     *    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \n           from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n2.0     Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Topeka's water supply and treatment facilities provide safe, reliable, and economical drinking water within the city limits and surrounding areas.  In our treatment process, we use the following chemical the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant to inactivate disease causing organisms and to maintain high quality potable water during distribution.  The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at the plant site is 220,0"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical:  Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for our facility would be the catastrophic failure on one full 55-ton tank railcar of chlorine.  The scenario is assumed to be a direct release over a 10-minute period, as required by the RMP regulation.  The release rate is 11,000 pounds per minute for a total release of 110,000 pounds.  The assumed meteorological conditions are 1.5 meters per second wind speed, atmospheric Stability Class F (very stable, calm evening conditions), and urban terrain.  Under these conditions,  the EPA  OCA Reference Table 11 predicts a distance of 9.9 miles to the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) of the release.  The population affected by this scenario is approximately 150,000, based on 1990 U.S. Census data.\n\nThe public receptors within this distance include schools, residences, hospitals, prison/correctional facilities, public recreation areas, and major commercial, office, and industrial areas, and airports.  The environmental receptors within this distance include a National Historic Site, and Other (Kansas River, tributaries, Lake Shawnee, Lake Sherwood, Topeka Zoo, and farm fields).\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical:  Chlorine\n\nThe alternate release scenario for our facility de"

      "SummaryText": "scribes a situation that would be more likely to occur than the worst-case and which would affect areas off-site.  This scenario assumes the release of liquid chlorine through a severed unloading line protected by an excess flow valve.  The excess flow valve is designed to close when the rate of flow of liquid chlorine exceeds 7,000 pounds per hour.  The assumed leak duration is 60 minutes, for a total release of 7,000 pounds of chlorine.  The assumed meteorological conditions are 3.0 meters per second wind speed, atmospheric Stability Class D (neutral stability, overcast conditions), and urban terrain.  Under these conditions, the EPA  OCA Reference Table 24 predicts a distance of about 0.2 mile to the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) of the release.  The population affected by this scenario is approximately 30, based on 1990 U.S. Census data.\n\nThe public receptors within this distance include commercial/industrial areas.  The environmental receptors within this distance include the Kansas River.\n\nWe are using this information to help ensure that our plant site and community emergency response plans address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nAdministrative controls that help prevent such releases from ever happening include proper training of all plant operators in the use of chlorine equipment.  At least two trained and certified operators are used whenever work is done in the chlorine evaporator room, when making connections to, and when disconnecting from the chlorine tank cars.  One operator acts as \"safety observer\", while the other(s) work on the equipment.  Each time a new tank car or container is connected for use, the operator performs a leak check of all connections to assure they are secure and properly installed.\n\nWe also use specialized instrumentation that provides continuous chlorine leak monitoring of the area around each chlorine tank railcar, the evaporator building, and the chlorine feed room.  Even a small leak in any of these areas would activate a"

The prevention programs in place include:\n\n1.     Regular review of safety information such as Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily\n         documentation of chlorine inventory, and regular updating of safety information to assure\n         accuracy and completeness.\n2.     Hazard review of the chlorination system using industry recommended checklists to assess\n         potential problems that could result in an accidental release, determine the safeguards needed\n         to control hazards or prevent equipment malfunction.\n3.     Written operating procedures that address initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,\n         emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or \n         emergency shutdown or a major change, consequences of deviations and steps required to correct\n         or avoid deviations, and routine equipment inspections.\n4.     Regular employee training to assure that each plant operator has the required knowledge, skills,\n        and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities assigned.\n5.     Written maintenance procedures and documentation to assure safe operation of critical equipment.\n        Operators routinely review these procedures prior to beginning maintenance procedures on the\n         chlorination equipment.\n6.     Compliance audits every 3 years to assure that the Topeka Water Treatment Plant facility and its\n        operators implement the risk management program and comply with the regulations.\n7.
