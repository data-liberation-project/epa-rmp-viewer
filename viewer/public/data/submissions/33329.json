      "SummaryText": "The Pottstown Borough Authority (PBA) WWTP located in Pottstown, Montgomery County, is owned by the Pottstown Municipal Authority (PMA) and operated by the PBA located at Borough Hall, 241 King Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania.  The plant discharges treated effluent into the Schuylkill River.\n\nThe Pottstown WWTP was upgraded in 1991 and is capable of treating 15.6 million gallons per day to the level required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of a WWTP is to protect public waterways from environmental harm and to promote the recreational, commercial, and/or industrial use of these waterways.  The WWTP helps to achieve and maintain water quality goals by achieving a high degree of treatment of all incoming wastewater, including industrial, prior to discharge to the Schuylkill River.\n\na. The Pottstown WWTP's accidental release prevention program is designed to ensure that the facility operates in compliance with the RMP Rule and with industry standards of performance, such as the guidance documents written by the Chlorine Institute.  The prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n - High level of training of the operators\n - Preventive maintenance program\n - Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n - Use of accurate and effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n - Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n - Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nb. The disinfection facility for the Pottstown WWTP is located on-site.  All wastewater is disinfected by using chlorine to kill any pathogenic organisms before discharging the water.  A maximum of 20 one-ton containers (40,000 pounds) of chlorine may be stored onsite at any time, with two chlorine containers in use at any given time.  Containers that are connected in the process are located in a brick building designed "

      "SummaryText": "specifically and solely for the safe movement, storage and use of these regulated chemicals.\n\nc. Preventive maintenance is regularly scheduled and performed.  Trained, experienced personnel clean, service and replace pipes, valves, chlorinators, and other equipment, as needed.  Pigtails are replaced on a yearly basis.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine detector.\n\nd. There have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\ne. The Pottstown WWTP is not required to maintain a site-specific emergency response program, as defined by OSHA and EPA.  However, it does have an Emergency Plan which has been coordinated with the LEPC, which gives specific details regarding emergency contacts, potentially affected areas, evacuation routes, and other information regarding the WWTP.  The WWTP would contact the local fire department, Apex and the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in the event of an accidental release, since it does not train its employees to handle such an emergency.\n\nf. Based on the hazard evaluation, the compliance audit, and other actions taken to prepare this RMP, a few areas were identified for improvement and changes were made to improve safety at the facility.  This included the following:\n\n - Writing a standard operating procedure for connecting and disconnecting containers;\n - A more formal documentation system for employee training;\n - Revising the preventive maintenance procedures;\n - Developing an Emergency Action Plan."
