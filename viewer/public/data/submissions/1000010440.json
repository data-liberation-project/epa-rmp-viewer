OUR FACILITY STORES FOR RETAIL SALE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WHICH IS USED AS A FERTILIZER. THE FACILITY IS USED IN THE SPRING AND IN THE FALL UNTIL FREEZE UP.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO COULD AFFECT 25 PEOPLE. THIS SCENARIO IS VERY UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT INSTALLED AT THIS FACILITY AND THE COMPANIES COMITTMENT TO SAFETY TRAINING AND MAINTANENCE OF THIS EQUIPMENT. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD AFFECT ABOUT 5 PEOPLE AND COMPANY PROPERTY.WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES IN THE LAST 5 YEARS. THROUGH INSPECTIONS, MAINTANENCE AND SAFETY TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEE'S. SAFETY TRAING IS OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS. ANNUALLY WE INVITE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO TOUR OUR FACILITY. EMERGENCY SHUT-OFFS, POWER AND PLUMBING ARE LOOKED AT. AT THIS TIME WE DISCUSS OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AND HOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES FIT INTO OUR PROGRAM.
