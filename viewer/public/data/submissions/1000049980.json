If an accidental release occurs, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department.\n\nFacility Information-The primary activity of this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer and distribution of propane to Farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored for ammonia is 130,000 pounds and maximum for propane is 109,000\n\nWorst-Case and alternative release scenario-The worst case scenario for ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 130,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 1.12 miles. The worst case scenario for propane is based on failure of a 30,000 gallon tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% @ 60F) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's Look-up Tables, the distance to the endpoint is .43 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia is based on a 2 minute release from a 3\" broken pipe, .49 miles is a distance to the endpoint (200 ppm) of .7 miles. The alternative release scenario for propane is based on the failure of a 30,000 gallon tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA Look-up Tables, based on less vapor being involved in the explosion (.67 factor multiplied by the .43 endpoint) the end point would be .29 miles\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program-The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Sa"
