Utilizing  pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals due to less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less vehicular transportation of these chemicals through their neighborhoods thus lowering the possibility of accidents. \r\n\r\nRubicon conducts business safely and effectively which is demonstrated by our outstanding safety record.  Rubicon has, for the last 50 years, effectively managed our systems to minimize risk to our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Rubicon is committed to maintaining this high standard of performance and plans to experience many more safe, productive years in this area.  Rubicon is committed to improving the safety at our facility for our employees, our near neighbors, and our community."

In addition, Rubicon conducts process hazard analyses, establishes EHS and unit operating policies and procedures, utilizes continuous process control and monitoring, and performs inspection and testing of equipment.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRubicon has had six incidents within the last five years:\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 2013, a temporary power surge caused the Distributive Computer Control System in the Reductions unit to shut down. This caused the DPA 2 Aniline Stripper to overpressure and relieve through the pressure safety valve.  The pressure safety valve released 1,370 pounds of aniline and 28 pounds of ammonia over a 32 minute period.  The percentage of ammonia in the stream is 2% which is greater than the 1% Risk Management Program rule threshold.  The Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office was notified of a site alert, which is not expected to impact offsite receptors. Modeling indicated that the ammonia did not reach ground level off of the Rubicon facility.  The Ascension Parish 911 dispatcher followed an incorrect response protocol and called for industrial sites downwind of the release to shelter in place.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 2014, an unexpected power outage caused the MDI 2 unit to lose power.  This caused a vapor mixture of hydrochloric acid/phosgene to enter the MDI test tank.  The MDI test tank overpressured and relieved through the pressure safety valve.

The surrounding industrial facilities were instructed to shelter in place.  Modeling indicated that the phosgene and hydrochloric acid did not travel off of the Rubicon facility.\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 2014, a tubing leak developed on a process instrument on the recovery column feed pump in the MDI 1 unit that released a mixture of chlorobenzene and phosgene.  The release lasted fifteen  minutes during which 0.2 pounds of chlorobenzene and 0.8 pounds of phosgene were released to the air.  The Ascension Parish Sherriff's Office was notified of a site alert that is expected to impact offsite receptors.   One public road was closed during the release as a precautionary measure.  During the emergency response, a Rubicon production technician received first and second degree burns to his hands.  He was sent to the Baton Rouge General burn unit and released later that day.\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 2015, the MDI 3 unit lost power to its Distributive Control System (DCS) while maintenance activities were  being performed on the MDI 3 Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) system.  This temporary power loss resulted in a vapor release of phosgene from vents on two MDI 3 test tanks and a monochlorobenzene (MCB) storage tank. The release lasted approximately forty minutes and released 0.7 pounds of phosgene vapor. The Ascension Parish Sherriff's Office was notified of a site alert that is expected to impact offsite receptors.  The surrounding industrial facilities were instructed to shelter in place.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 2016, a leak on the MDI 1 C Phosgene Reactor cooling water system released a gaseous phosgene/chlorine/carbon monoxide mixture to the air due to a reactor tube failure.  The release lasted two minutes and released 0.6 pounds of phosgene, 1.5 pounds of chlorine and 0.8 pounds of carbon monoxide.   Chlorine is not held above the threshold quantit"

The second and third elements of Rubicon's emergency response program are preparation and response.  Preparing for emergency situations at Rubicon includes exercises and drills for the training of the internal emergency response units.  The internal emergency response units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders with equipped ambulance and a first aid station with nurse, and teams specializing in vertical and confined space rescues.  Formal written fire and release preplans have been developed to assist training and drill scenarios.  A plant-wide evacuation drill for all employees is performed at least once per year.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: 888 emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon using the CAER radio or 911, Rubicon coordinates with the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office (APSO) the activation of all or part of the CAER emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CAER chemical facilities are located.  This coordination can also activate the computerized Emergency Telephone Alerting System provided by the Community Alert Network (CAN) and the Emergency Broadcast System (television and/or radio) for Ascension Par"

These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plants, the Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\r\n\r\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.  These authorities are Louisiana State Police, Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, Geismar Fire Department, Prairieville Fire Department, Red Cross, St. Elizabeth Hospital (Gonzales), Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital (Baton Rouge), Baton Rouge General Medical Center (Baton Rouge), Summit Hospital (Baton Rouge) and the Industrial Mutual Aid Group (IMAG).  The Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness has the ability to facilitate the activation of the National Guard Civil Support Team to respond to an on-site emergency.  IMAG also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Systems.  Rubicon performs annual training with most of these organizations or provides information necessary for coordinated emergency response.\r\n\r\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.  Rubicon also has emergency internal procedures that address Emergency Action and Crisis Management, Emergency Brigade, 888 Emergency Notification Telephone System, Radiation Sources, Plant-wide Evacuation, Bomb Threats, and Hurricanes and Parking Area Emergency Notification System.  Preplanned emergency responses are practiced and are used during release drill scenarios.  Other response practices include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, the SAFER System for air dispersion modeling of a toxic gas release, sampling on-site and off-"
