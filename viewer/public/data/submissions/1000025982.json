This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?A description of our facility and our uses of substances that are regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation.\n\n?An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n?A five-year history of accidental releases for chemicals that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.\n\n?An overview of our emergency response program.\n\n?An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accident chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nVopak Terminal Deer Park is a for-hire liquid storage terminal.  Chemicals and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the bulk liquids stored, handled and transported in this facility.  Products are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, pipeline, tank car, and tank truck.  At this time the facility is storing four chemicals (Propylene Oxide, Vinyl Acetate Monomer Isoprene and Piperylene [1,3 Pentadiene]) that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences under their Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Propylene Oxide and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are considered toxic substances but are not regulated as highly hazardous substances under the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; therefore, these chemicals are regulated under Program Level 2 o"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.
