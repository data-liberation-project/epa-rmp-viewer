In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements, the City of Louisville RMP document demonstrates compliance with the following components of an RMP.\n\n- A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential on-site and off-site impacts of worst-case and alternate accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances (Hazard Assessment).\n- An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management program (Management System).\n- A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving regulated substances (Accident Prevention).\n- An emergency response plan to mitigate any accidental releases that occur (Emergency Response Plan).\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with regulations cited at 40 CFR 68.155 through 68.185 for the on-site disinfection processes covered by RMP regulations.\n\nThe primary activity at the water treatment plant is the treatment of water for the City of Louisville, Colorado.

RMP*Comp was developed by the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the EPA.\n\nA map showing the radius of concern for both the worst-case and alternate-case scenarios is provided.  The smaller radius shown represents the alternate-case scenario.  Maps were created using ARCGIS 8.3 2000 census data was used to generate the population data for the areas within each radius of concern.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the chlorine holding tank due to corrosion, impacts, or structural failure.  The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of ten minutes.\n\nWorst-case distance to toxic endpoint for 2,000 pound chlorine release is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine under the alternate-case scenario is as follows:  92 pounds of chlorine to a distance of 0.1 miles.\n\nSid Copeland, Superintendent at the City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant is a qualified individual with overall responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the RMP.  He has the authority to commit resources required to implement the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe City of Louisville Water Treatment Plant is a \"non-responding facility\" and emergency responses permissible by the City of Louisville Water Treatment Facility personnel are responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release, as well as releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, explosion, or chemical exposure) by employees in the immediate release area and by maintenance personnel.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at the water treatment "
