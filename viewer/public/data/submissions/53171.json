The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing.\n\nAtlas Pipeline Mid-Continent LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Chaney Dell Gas Plant is located near Ringwood, Oklahoma and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Natural Gas Liquid Product (Y-Grade)\n2. Residue Gas\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Chaney Dell Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving  415,000 pounds (75,700 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in the Condensate Tank (30-10). The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using the EPA OCA Guidance Equations, the 1 psi overpressure was reached at 0.60 miles. The WCS could affect a nearby public receptor. A consideration of the 0.60 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Chaney Dell Gas Plant is a vapor clo"

Training\n\nAtlas has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\nF.
