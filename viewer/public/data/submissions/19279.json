      "SummaryText": "The Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) Linden Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) Storage Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in risk management programs, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of processes.  The policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable accidents. However, if an accidental release does occur, PSE&G gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release or contact outside responders, as needed.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant is located on South Wood Avenue in the city of Linden, New Jersey between the PSEG Linden Electric Generating Station and the New Jersey Turnpike.  It is situated in the northwest section of 40 acres of property and is adjacent to a Duke Energy (previously Texas Eastern) metering and regulating station at an interconnection between the PSE&G and Duke Energy natural gas pipelines. It was established in 1974 as an ancillary unit to the Synthetic Natural Gas Plant that was closed in 1989 and demolished in 1998. The LPG storage tanks remained as an emergency supply for peak shaving operations. Operations at the facility can be classified using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 4925 or North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 22121 (Mixed, Manufactured, or Liquefied Petroleum Gas Production and/or Distribution).\n\nOperations at the plant consist of eleven horizontal 90,000-gallon LPG storage tanks.  Additionally, a material testing laboratory located in buildings formerly used by the Synthetic Natural Gas facility is now used as a base of operations for the field staff in the testing of plastic gas service piping and associated materials.  The Linden LPG Storage Plant is not permanently manned and only occasionally has truck deliveries fo"

Please note, LPG is composed of primarily propane (>90% by weight) as detailed in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS.  Therefore, all references to LPG or propane refer to the same substance unless otherwise specified\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at the gas plant is a catastrophic tank failure in the propane storage tank farm, resulting in a release of 302,400 pounds (equivalent to one full storage tank) of propane over a 10-minute period.  Although PSE&G has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 1 psi for this WCS is 0.54 miles.\n\nFor an alternate release scenario (ARS), PSE&G has reviewed possible release scenarios based upon a review of operations at the facility.  The release scenarios considered in the alternate release scenario are more probable to occur than the worst-case release scenario, however, PSE&G has implemented numerous process and safety procedures to insure that no release will occur.  ARS considered in the analysis include truck pull-away, a process pipe breaking and overfilling of a storage tank.   The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.2 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\nOverview of General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n4.0    Prevention Program\n\nSection 4 of this document contains the detailed explanation of the Linden LPG Storage Plant Prevention Program.

These documents address the chemical properties of LPG and associated hazards, limits for process parameters, LPG inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Due to the nature of operations at the facility, minimal documentation is needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\nLPG-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  The plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  \n\n4.2    Process Hazard Analysis (40 CFR 68.67)\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, the LPG storage and transfer process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant has used the What-If? / Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique has been deemed adequate based upon the selection process presented in \"Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures\" (Center for Chemical Process Safety, 1992).  The analysis was conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identified and evaluated hazards of the process as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team made suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believed such measures were necessary.  \n\n4.3    Operating Procedures (40 CFR 68.69)\n\nThe PSE&G Linden LPG Storage Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of proces"
