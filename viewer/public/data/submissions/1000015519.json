This section summarizes the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\nSEMCO will utilize current and appropriate engineering practices to inspect refrigeration equipment prior to start up and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and subsequent equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel and certified refrigeration contractors regularly inspect the equipment, as required.\nDescription of Source and Substance Handled\nThe SEMCO facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in their produce and cold storage operations. The refrigeration plant is comprised of one stationary process that provides refrigeration for cold rooms, portable vacuum cooling, pressure cooling and ice manufacturing. Produce is brought to the facility where it is pre-cooled and stored for processing and shipment. \nAll refrigeration equipment is tied together in a single common system. This equipment consists of portable and permanently installed equipment. The refrigeration system configuration includes two compressor skids, one portable high-side refrigeration trailer, a high pressure/storage receiver, a low pressure receiver pumping unit, an ice maker pumping unit, a suction accumulator, one full  vacuum tube system consisting of two A? car units joined together, cold room evaporators, pressure cooling evaporators, ice makers, evaporative  condenser, and related safety equipment which includes a refrigerant discharge and diffusion tank system. \nThe system is operated in the full configuration during the growing season from April through November. Most portable units are relocated to other facilities during the off season. Minimal cooling operations occur during the off season.\nAmmonia is the only listed material used at this facilit"

      "SummaryText": "y. The plant operates with a total charge of approximately 22,680 lbs. of ammonia distributed throughout the facility. \nThe ammonia charge is contained primarily in the high pressure receivers and the low pressure pump receivers. The remainder of the refrigerant is contained within the piping and the refrigeration coils.  \n Ammonia Refrigeration\nThe refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry is as follows:\n1.    Low pressure vapor is compressed to high pressure gas by refrigeration compressors.\n2.    High pressure vapor is condensed to high pressure liquid by the evaporative condenser.  Condensation occurs because of heat rejection to ambient resulting from the evaporation of water sprayed on the condenser coil.\n3.    High pressure liquid gravity feeds from the condenser to the high pressure receiver where it is stored until needed.\n4.    High pressure ammonia is fed from the high pressure receiver to the low pressure vessels.  This is made possible by the pressure differential between the two types of vessels.  Pressure is dropped when the liquid passes though an expansion device located between the high and low pressure vessels.\n5.    The evaporators are recirculation types where low pressure liquid is pumped from low pressure receiver. The evaporators are room coils for maintaining cold room or freezer storage temperatures.\n6.    Evaporation of the low pressure liquid occurs due to warmer air coming in contact with the evaporators. The evaporation produces the cooling effect.  \nA mixture of liquid and vapor is returned to the low pressure vessel. Low pressure vapor is drawn off by the compressors and the liquid is circulated back through the room coils. The ammonia refrigeration system consists of compressors, evaporative refrigerant condenser, pressure vessels for storage of refrigerant and system operations for various cooling applications, and interconnecting piping and electronic controls.

      "SummaryText": "mponents of the ammonia refrigeration system is located in SEMCO's CAL-ARP Binder.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn. \nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nSEMCO Cooling has implemented the Risk Management Plan (RMP) at the Salinas, California facility in order to comply with the regulations, and to fulfill this facility's responsibility to protecting its employees, equipment, property, the surrounding community, and the environment from accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\nThe purpose of the RMP is to reduce and minimize the occurrence and the consequences of releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration process. The following summarizes the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nSEMCO maintains an accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections and maintenance, and log keeping of (1) operating conditions, (2) scheduled maintenance, (3) emergency response, and (4) operator training. \nThe program consists of pre-start up inspection, emergency response, and regular training. The existing RMP for the facility was updated from the original RMPP in 2002. A Hazards Analysis (PHA or HAZOP) was performed in 2008, and re-validated for this RMP. Equipment corrections and updates were made for those items determined to have the highest potential for offsite releases in this 2009 RMP update.\nSafety and equipmen"

Additional items requiring further review, correction, and/or updating will be identified.\nRefrigeration equipment will be reviewed and the RMP will be updated when changes to equipment occur or when new equipment is brought on-site. \nThe operations at this facility are seasonal with operations occurring primarily between the months of April through November during the produce growing season. The equipment is inspected during the off-season and any repairs or change outs are made at this time. This off-season time is used to prepare the equipment for non-stop operation during the season.\nCurrently, ammonia system operating controls are fairly state of the art. The compressors are individually controlled with factory solid state micro processor controls or manually set Penn-style electromechanical switches. These control capacity by operating the compressor unloading based on suction pressure. The control settings for each machine indicate the control levels for suction pressure, discharge pressure, and oil pressure. Shut-down limits exist for low suction pressure, high discharge pressure and temperature, low discharge pressure, and high oil temperature. There is also a differential pressure control for oil pressure failure. If the differential between oil pressure and compressor suction pressure becomes too large, the compressor will stop, preventing damage to the machine. The display provided on the compressor control panel can be used to confirm these set point levels and actual pressures. If a compressor fails it is locked out and the system control starts another machine. The Control System Microprocessor also protects against abnormal conditions. \nLiquid ammonia reaching the refrigeration compressors could cause equipment failure.

This accumulator captures any liquid carry over from the evaporators and chiller system thus protecting the compressor from liquid slugging. The suction accumulator has a high level cut out which provides additional protection and provides shutdown of compressors and notification in the event of a high level occurrence.\nSafety relief valves are factory set to relieve the system if pressure reaches above 250 psig on the low side or 250 psig on the high side. There are dual relief valves on the high and low pressure receiver and on the compressor oil separator. A three-way valve allows one of the valves to be serviced while the other continues to provide protection. The sizing, piping, and condition of the relief valves were checked during the field survey. Relief valves are installed on all system components. The pressure relief valve discharges are collected into a common header and discharged to water filled diffuser tank. Relief valves should be re-certified or replaced once every five years.\nAmmonia releases will be sensed by on-site personnel. Notification to other employees in the event of a release will be by intercom or by radio system.\nInitial emergency response is provided by onsite personnel.  Onsite personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response.
