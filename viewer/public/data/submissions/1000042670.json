Facility staff have coordinated with the local fire department to ensure that they are fully trained and equipped to quickly respond to an incident.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                               PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n    The City of Fort Lauderdale undertook a study to review the costs and qualitative issues of changing to an alternative (i.e., safer) disinfection system.  The alternatives evaluated included switching to on-site generation of sodium hypochlorite (at 0.8% concentration) and purchasing bulk hypochlorite (at 12% concentration).  In addition, these alternatives were compared to staying with chlorine gas and enclosing the existing facilities (to contain a chlorine leak) and adding an emergency chlorine scrubber.  The installation of an emergency chlorine scrubber was selected as the most appropriate for the G. T. Lohmeyer WWTP. The Emergency Chlorine Scrubber was installed and began operation in August 2006."

      "SummaryText": "INTRUDUCTION\r\n    At the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorineA\u00bfs introduction into public water supplies and into wastewater treatment systems, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water and wastewater disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\r\n    The use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\r\n    As an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\r\n    The City of Fort Lauderdale Public Services Department has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.

Lohmeyer Wastewater Treatment Plant (G.T.L. WWTP).  The facilityA\u00bfs mission is to protect public health by efficiently treating and properly disposing of the communityA\u00bfs wastewater.  Approximately 1,500 pounds per day of chlorine gas is used to disinfect the wastewater prior to disposal.  A maximum of 40,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as a gas that is liquefied under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each. \r\nChlorine Process and Safety Equipment\r\n    The G.T. Lohmeyer WWTP chlorine system is a liquid chlorine feed system.  The system consists of an enclosed chlorine storage and handling area and an adjacent enclosed room containing the evaporators, chlorinators, and injector assemblies.  Eight containers are hooked up in four banks, two containers per bank.  The four banks feed to a common manifold.\r\nOne bank is in service at any one time and feeds liquid chlorine to the evaporators.  The liquid chlorine in the evaporator is contained in a pressure vessel.  A hot water bath surrounding the pressure vessel transfers heat to the chlorine, which in turn vaporizes into a gas.  Chlorine gas flows under pressure from the evaporator to the chlorinator.  As the gas enters the chlorinator, a regulator reduces the gas pressure to a slight vacuum.  The vacuum created in the injector assemblies pulls the chlorine gas through the chlorinators (which control the flowrate of gas) and into the injectors.  The chlorine gas is mixed with water in the injectors to form a chlorine solu"

The chlorine solution is then fed to the various application points.\r\n    The chlorine storage and handling area, as well as the evaporator/chlorinator room, are equipped with chlorine leak detectors.  The detectors will activate audible and visual alarms throughout the facility to give warning to plant staff.  The detectors will also activate operation of the Emergency Scrubber System which provides neutralization of chlorine gas by means of sodium hydroxide.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                        RISK MANAGEMENT AND PROCESS SAFERY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OVERVIEW\r\n    Chlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA\u00bfs (OSHAA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n    The primary components of the RMP are as follows:\r\n* A five-year accident history\r\n* An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\r\n* A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e. minimize the potential for a release)\r\n* An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled\r\n* An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\r\n    Following development of the RMP submitted in year 1999, the facility must submit a RMP Update to the EPA by June 21, 2004.  The RMP update, which is presented every five years, reports any process changes or if a new process is added.  The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the prevention program element of the EPA RMP.  The G.T. Lohmeyer WWTP RMP meets the requirements of both regulations.\r\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the RMP."
