Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices. To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Omaha, Nebraska this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119. All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.\r\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Omaha, Nebraska has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR\r\n191 0.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n At the Omaha Nebraska Plant WE USE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR OUR REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\r\nPROCESS COOLING WITH\r\n Combined Inventory of 119,648 LBS.\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program.\r\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68. For ammonia systems\r\nTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance. Tyson Foods Inc. uses the lIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators. We have trained people in the ammonia system to maintain proper care of our system.\r\nWe use Garden City Ammonia training school for our Ammonia Techs.\r\n\r\n4.

      "SummaryText": "485 cubic feet.  Using the ammonia temperature of 95 degrees yields an approximate operating pressure of 150 psig and an ammonia liquid density of 41.07 pounds per cubic foot.  The calculation of 485 cubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields the ammonia capacity of 18,814 pounds.  Using RMP Comp with the settings of ammonia liquefied under pressure, urban topography and passive mitigation the distance to endpoint is 1.2 miles. \r\n\r\n       Alternative Release: Tyson Foods has chosen the alternative release scenario of a pressure relief valve activation.  Pressure relief valve activations historically have been the primary release type within the company.  Most of the pressure relief valves in the company have an inlet port size of \u00be\" and outlet port size of 1\".  Hansen Technologies is a preferred manufacturer for pressure relief valves used at Tyson facilities.  Since some facilities vary in size and type, this pressure relief valve manufactured by Hansen Technologies was chosen for a standard scenario.  This valve has an inlet port size of 1\" and an outlet port size of 1-1/4\" and discharge flow rating of 1136 pounds per minute (air rating) at a pressure setting of 250 psig.  Tyson chose the release duration of 10 minutes in an urban setting to yield a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles which should exceed the property boundary at Tyson facilities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n5. Five-year accident history. Tyson Processing Services, Inc. Had no Accidental Ammonia or Chemical Release.  \r\n\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program.\r\nA SCBA-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site. This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q). The team will implement control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate other than a major incident.  In the case of a major incident / release, the Omaha Fire Department would act as the Repsonders; Tyson's facility"
