The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders \ntrained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule. Orion \nmaintains a supervisory alarm system. One designated person and \ntwo backup people are on call on weekends.\n\nThe Sioux Falls, SD facility manufactures frozen dough. Anhydrous \nammonia is used in the refrigeration system at this facility. \nAmmonia is the most efficient and environmentally compatible \nrefrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high concentration \nand is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative metabolic poison, \ndoes not cause cancer or other dread diseases and does not cause \nlasting environmental damage. The refrigeration system at this \nfacility contains about 9,100 pounds of ammonia. Although the \nsystem inventory would not require compliance with either the \nProcess Safety Management or Risk Management Planning rules, \nSchwan's has chosen to place this facility in compliance with both \nrules, because of the close proximity of the Ramkota Inn complex.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of urban. Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneo"

The alternate case will be a release rate of 400 \npounds per minute.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe Sioux Falls, SD facility maintains a 3-shift emergency \nresponse team, trained at the 24-hour technician level. The team \nnumbers 13 members. The training is conducted by the Corporate \nEnvironmental Compliance Manager. The training is designed with a \nheavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, personal \nprotective equipment up to use of Level `A' suits and interaction \nwith an incident command system (ICS). Copies of emergency plans \nare filed with the Fire Department and annual facility \nwalkthroughs are conducted with Fire Officers. Preplanned command \nposts and staging areas have been designated and Incident Command \ntransfer and liaison functions have been established. A post-\nincident debriefing is conducted after each incident.\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in \nthe Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are \nimplemented as a result of employee-based Total Quality Management \n(TQM) teams, a designated PSM team and as a result of system \nengineering modifications and extensions. Post incident \ndebriefings and incident investigations are used to identify \nadditional improvements to system safety."
