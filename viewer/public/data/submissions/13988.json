Administrative controls include strict adherence to the applicable flammable hazard classification for the blending area, thus eliminating ignition sources that would originate from the blending area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for EPA listed flammable chemicals on our site involves difluoroethane.\n\nA 1\" hole forms in a 2\" hose associated with the unloading operation of difluoroethane from a railroad tank car. Approximately 10,605 pounds of difluoroethane is released and the entire quantity participates in a vapor cloud explosion upon ignition.
