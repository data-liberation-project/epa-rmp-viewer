We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n3.0 Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n5.0 Five-Year Accident History\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n8.0 Certifications\n9.0 RMP Data Elements\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Louisville Packaging site blends and packages a variety of refrigerant gases. In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nChemical     Use of Substance         Quantity Handled/Stored (lbs.)\n\ndifluoroethane    blending operation    165,000\npropane        blending operation    17,300\n\n3.0 Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios for our facility. The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the flammable chemicals on our site involves the rupture of a railroad tank car, releasing 165,000 pounds of difluoroethane instantaneously.

An explosion could cause a 1 psi overpressure extending 1584 feet possibly causing partial demolition of buildings which can result in serious injuries to people, and shattering of glass windows, which may cause skin lacerations from flying glass. No active controls are considered. Administrative controls include strict adherence to the applicable flammable hazard classification for the blending area, thus eliminating ignition sources that would originate from the blending area.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for EPA listed flammable chemicals on our site involves difluoroethane.\n\nA 1\" hole forms in a 2\" hose associated with the unloading operation of difluoroethane from a railroad tank car. Approximately 10,605 pounds of difluoroethane is released and the entire quantity participates in a vapor cloud explosion upon ignition. An explosion could cause a 1 psi overpressure extending 317 feet possibly causing partial demolition of buildings which can result in serious injuries to people, and shattering of glass windows, which may cause skin lacerations from flying glass. No active controls are considered. Administrative controls include strict adherence to the applicable flammable hazard classification for the blending area, thus eliminating ignition sources that would originate from the blending area.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nOur company maintains a number of accident prevention programs, which implement chemical specific prevention steps in order to ensure safe operation of all processes.
