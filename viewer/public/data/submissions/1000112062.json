Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee involved in the process and also and every three years as required by federal regulations. The anhydrous ammonia tanks and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. Pressurized tanks and plumbing are tested according to the standards for the pressure vessel testing.  The facility strives to meet current industry accepted standards.\r\n\r\nC.\tEmergency Response Policies and Programs\r\n\r\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings. This facility training covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency response practices and procedures.
