Utah Gas Corp. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. As for emergency response, the Company has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\r\n\r\nUtah Gas Corp. understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the UGC Emergency Response Manual and Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\u00a0\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Harley Dome Gas Plant is located near the intersection of US Highway 6 and Book Cliffs Ridge Road in rural Grand County, Utah. The facility processes up to 15 mmscf/d of natural gas for the extraction of Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). NGL is a flammable pressurized liquid mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables ethane, propane, butane isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. This facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations. \r\n\u00a0\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe prevention program and chemical-specifi"

      "SummaryText": "c prevention steps are described in detail in the Utah Gas Corp. Emergency Response Manual and Emergency Action Plan. The prevention program includes the following elements:\r\n\u00a0\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\u00a0\r\nUtah Gas Corp. has established and coordinated emergency response action plans with the Grand County Sheriff.  The emergency response plan also includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.  The specific details of the action plans are documented in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\u00a0\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\r\n\r\nIn accordance with section 68.12(b)(1) of the RMP rule, Utah Gas Corp. analyzed a worst-case flammable release scenario (no RMP regulated toxic substances are present) for the single RMP process at the Harley Dome Gas Plant.  The worst-case release scenario (WCS) assumed a vapor cloud explosion modeled using EPA's RMP*Comp software which assumes a 10 percent yield factor using a TNT equivalent method per the RMP rule. Utah Gas Corp. confirmed that the nearest public receptor to the Harley Dome Gas Plant is beyond the 1-psi overpressure endpoint distance of the flammable WCS.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\u00a0\r\nThere were no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials at the Harley Dome Gas Plant meeting the five-year accident history requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\u00a0\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
