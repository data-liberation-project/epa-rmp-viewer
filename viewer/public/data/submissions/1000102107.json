This program reviews the safety record of all our contractors to help ensure that we hire only contractors who can safely perform the desired tasks. We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency action procedures. The Contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility.

All of our personnel are trained in evacuation procedures. The EHS Manager is responsible for apprising the Region IV Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of the emergency situation, and the LEPC is responsible for notifying the public, if necessary.\n\n7.

We audit our covered process every 3 years to be certain our program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations. We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP rules and in our process design, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these rules and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\ni)   Third-Party Audit - Should we experience an accidental release that results in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, we will employ an independent, third-party to conduct the next Compliance Audit.\n\nj)   Incident Investigation - We investigate all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in (i.e., a near miss) serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.

Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.

These documents address (1) physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, (2) operating parameters for our equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration for our equipment. We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\nb)   Process Hazard Analysis - We perform and periodically update process hazard analysis (PHAs) for our covered process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our process. This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the covered process. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.\n\nResponsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. The analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\nc)   Operating Procedures - Our operators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed.

The Site's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 311812 (Commercial Bakeries). As part of the Site's refrigeration system, which is used to freeze the bakery products for shipment, the Site handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical as defined in the USEPA's RMP Rule, Cal OES CalARP program, and OSHA's PSM standard, in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Facility is registered to Program Level 3 under the USEPA CAPP and Cal OES CalARP programs. The Facility normally operates 6 days per week, 24 hours per day and maintains approximately 340 full time employees.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia, which is liquefied under pressure, is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The majority of the Site\u2019s refrigeration machinery is located outside, adjacent to the building.\n\n1.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action (\u00a768.155(a) and \u00a72745.3(a)): Protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, and of the surrounding environment, is our top priority, and we have a comprehensive program in place to reduce risks associated with our process.\n\nHazard Assessment and Reduction - We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia in our manufacturing processes and seek out ways in which to reduce those risks.\n\nAccident Prevention - We engineer and construct our manufacturing processes and equipment to minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases."
