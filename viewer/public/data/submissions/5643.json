If an accidential release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local and county fire departments to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nOur primary activity at Mountain View Co-op is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored and handled would be 159,605 pounds in our 10,500 and 22,500 gallon storage tanks.\n\nOur worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 108,820 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nOur alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .10 miles.\n\nOur accidential release prevention program is in compliance with OSHA's standard on \"Storage and Handling Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidential releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOur emergency response program is provided to the state and county under the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Mountain View Co-op.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no "
