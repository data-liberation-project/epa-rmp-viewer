      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWD provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWD in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWD currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Henry J. Mills Water Treatment Plant (Mills Plant).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWD regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWD has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Mills Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\r\n\r\nMills Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the a"

      "SummaryText": "onal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\r\n\r\nThe Chlorine System at the Mills Plant is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to convert the chlorine to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment systems for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\r\n\r\nThe chlorine storage vessels (cargo tanks) are totally contained in the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility storage bays.\r\n\r\nThe process flow for the Chlorine System begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.  Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\r\n\r\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection pu"

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator rooms, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\r\n\r\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.  Caustic soda (~20% concentration) is used as the scrubbing media.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, leak detectors, safety systems and computer control system are connected to the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.  In the event power is lost at the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, an alarm will alert the control room.  The water treatment plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup p"

This system allows Mills Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Mills Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMills Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Mills Plant chlorine system.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\n\r\nNo chlorine releases that caused or c"

Mills Plant has Technician Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases and will respond to emergency releases only to assess.  Mills Plant also includes employees trained in Incident Command System, who can coordinate with and provide technical assistance to outside emergency responders.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside City Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Mills Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside City Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Mills Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2004 when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Mills Plant.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Of the changes proposed, most prominent among them was a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers, a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. A PHA was conducted in February 2006 as part of the chlorine containment and scrubber modification project.  In October 2011 the PHA was"
