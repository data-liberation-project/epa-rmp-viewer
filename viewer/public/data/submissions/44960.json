(99.98% pure or better).\nThe facility adheres to OSHA 29CFR 1910.119.  It has an emergency action plan based on 1919.38.  A full response team including training per 1910.120, PPE, and a site plan has been formed with two teams of four responders per shift.  Local response agencies including the fire department and hospitals have been contacted and information has been relayed as to the hazards of the process and necessary treatments and responses.  The Fire Department was given three tours of the facility for each shift and shown the emergency features.  We also went over our hazmat flag system with them which gives them not only directional information but wind speeds.\nWe based our worst case and alternate worst case on the EPA dispersion charts even though we understand IIAR has deemed them to be extremely over exaggerated to give us a wider area of concern.\nOur worst case encompasses 22 busineses and approximately 125 homes.\nIIAR is the International Institute of Ammonai Refrigeration and is the leader in defining the rules and regulations to which the industry abides by.\nThe facility was tested to the maximum working pressures and signed off on by the city inspector.  The system then was tested by vacuum and held for one week.\nThe system was built to current codes and fully monitored and characterized within the facility and around the major leak points using electrochemical sensors and a control system that will isolate zones within the system should a leak occur.  This should minimize the release of ammonia from the system and prevent a catastophic release.  This system and the location of vessels inside a separate building should mitigate the release and allow the ammonia to escape through the ventilation system in the roof and outside at a height of 30 feet.  Ammonia rises in atmospheric conditions caus"

We advertised this in the local paper for three weeks since the paper is only published twice a week.  We had no one show up for the meeting.\nAll technology is new, fully tested and state of the art.\nAll SOP's were written and trained by a third partyRETA levelA operator for ammonia refrigeration and revised and reviewed by the operators of Odom's."
