The registration for this process is presented in the GRM-PG - Appendix A. \n\n\n\nThe RUWTP is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the RUWTP utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. The RUWTP is located at 800 Canal Street in the south-central portion of the City of El Paso, Texas, and adjacent to the Rio Grande River International Boundary and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The RUWTP is surrounded by commercial, residential, and vacant land.\n\n\n\nCurrently the RUWTP has the potential to store up to twenty-five (25) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage room and up to forty-five (45) 150-lb chlorine containers, allowing the potential to store a total of 56,750 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is ten (10) one-ton chlorine and thirty-three (33) 150-lb chlorine containers at any one time. The average amount of chlorine stored at RUWTP is 24,950 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n\n\n?    Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 2.5 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 35,000 people; Mexico's potential affected population was unable to be determined however, a comparable population resides in the worst case vulnerable zone. The alternative \"more likely\" release estimated population is approximately 0 people.\n\n \n\nThe RMP rule requires the identification of environmental receptors within the to"

The RUWTP is approximately five-hundred (500) feet from the Rio Grande River.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) is the responsible agency that monitors the ecosystem of the Rio Grande River. \n\n\n\n?    Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\n\n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n\n\n\n?    Formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release (Emergency Response Program).\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB's \"Emergency Response Action Plan\" and the Chlorine Institute's \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\" The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process, and procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \n\n\n\nMexico and The United States created the Joint Contingency Plan (JCP)for use as a rapid international response to contingencies associated with chemical hazardous substances along the inland border.
