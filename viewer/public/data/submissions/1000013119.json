To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element of these programs.  There is however a single person (General Manager) who has overall responsibility for the PSM and RMP.  Most all of the program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit.  Any audit recommendation to improve any program elements are addressed in a timely manner.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated at least every five years, or more often if required by changes to the system(s).  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from the hazard analysis are addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is intended that the PSM/RMP programs be actively used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices and written programs that are implemented at the facility only incidental released of ammonia will occurred due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear.\n\nFacility\nThis facility is used for the storage and packaging of fruit products, primarily pears.  The facility has a combination of controlled atmosphere rooms and non-controlled atmosphere rooms.  The facility is in operation nearly year around from the time freshly picked fruit is brought into the rooms, till the next harvest season begins, or all product has been shipped from the facility.  The refrigeration system uses ammonia, which"

The entire refrigeration system is controlled by a computer, which also provides alarming and auto-dial notification to the refrigeration operator if some control parameter is out of acceptable limits.\n\nRelease Considerations\nFollowing program guidelines a A?Worse CaseA? release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a hazard assessment report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in the A?Process Hazard AnalysisA? of the system and facility.  The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \n\nFive year release history A? No Releases\nThis system has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  If any actual release occur or even a near miss, an incident investigation would be done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nThis facility has a written A?Emergency Action PlanA? that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  All responses by Peshastin Hi-Up Grower employeeA?s will be A?defensiveA? actions to control and contain an ammonia release until outside responders arrive to take A?offensiveA? actions as appropriate for a release.  Peshastin Hi-Up Grower does evacuation drills at least annually with all employees at the facility to assure safe and appropriate actions are done.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n This facility holds monthly safety meetings with Management Staff, Supervisors and Employee Representatives where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintai"
