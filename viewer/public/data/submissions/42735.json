We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nThe Enterprise Mankato Terminal and Storage is segregated into two separate storage facilities.  The hydrocarbon portion of the facility is owned by Enterprise Terminal & Storage, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree, LLC and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.  The anhydrous ammonia portion of the facility is owned by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P. and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.\r\n\r\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\r\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n* Emergency Response Programs\r\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Mankato Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Mankato facility is a pipeline, storage and transport truck loading facility.  The pipeline system is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and aqueous ammonia pipeline"

The propane and ammonia storage/loading facilities are regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\r\n\r\nThe Mankato Terminal has three pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These three pipelines are in part, a mix product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated propane line and a dedicated anhydrous ammonia line which is owned by Magellan Ammonia Pipeline, L.P. (Magellan) and operated by Enterprise Products Operating L.P.  In addition, the facility receives propane from the pipeline to four 90,000 gallon capacity storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.\r\n\r\nThe Magellan ammonia system receives ammonia product off of the ammonia pipeline and is thus routed to their three tanks which are two 90,000 gallon tanks and a single 63,000 gallon tank.  In addition to the same ammonia system, a portion of the ammonia product can be routed to a cold storage tank which is owned and operated by Koch Nitrogen Company (Koch) with limited operations by Enterprise.  Koch is accountable to file their own RMP for their assets and therefore is only mentioned for the purpose of the facility description.\r\n\r\nAll of the previously mentioned tanks (propane and ammonia) are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed a maximum capacity of 80%.\r\n\r\nIn our facility we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported and stored at the facility via a dedicated anhydrous ammonia pipeline.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\r\n\r\nThis simulation involves a complete failure of two of the three anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the transfer loading hose on the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 2,500 pounds per minutes for 10 minutes after the hose break.  The simulation calculated that 25,000 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.

The simulation calculated that 30,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Blue Earth County Emergency Management Director, which includes the local Police department, Sheriff\u00bfs Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, the local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the emergency notification alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Blue Earth County Sheriff\u00bfs Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the system\u00bfs control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  The Enterprise Houston Control Center has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by Operation.
