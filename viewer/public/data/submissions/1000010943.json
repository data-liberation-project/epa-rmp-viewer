The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) isbeing filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.   \n\nThis 5-year update is a complete re-submittal with certification.  It includes all RS's handled at this facility in excess of California ARP threshold quantities.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Willits's Water Quality Control Plant is located at 300 N. Lenore Street, Willits, CA in Mendocino County, and has inventories of chlorine, an RS used for disinfection, and sulfur dioxide, an RS used for dechlorination, in amounts greater than the California threshold quantities for these RS's. The chlorine inventory is also greater than the Federal threshold quantity. The facility is located in an industrial area on the northeast corner of town.  There are 5 full-time employees at this site. Chlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, an"

      "SummaryText": "d stored on ton container scales inside a locked room.  The chlorine is used to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses.  The sulfur dioxide is used to remove chlorine residual from plant effluent for aquatic toxicity control prior to discharge to the watercourse.  Pressurized chlorine and sulfur dioxide within ton containers is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the action of submerged inductor units using a high-speed rotating impeller to induce a vacuum.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of City of Willits that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, City of Willits has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving these chemicals; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the processes and external events which might affect the processes; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by City of Willits are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  The City of Willits has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements a"

The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, enclosing the chemical storage room.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCity of Willits's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Mendocino County Public Health Department, Environmental Health Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination, and the Little Lake Fire Protection District.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with City of Willits personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which City of Willits committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress. Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
