      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n      At DuPont Chambers Works, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We follow the DuPont Corporate philosophy that the \"goal is zero\".  This means we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to support this goal of zero.  We constantly assess our progress against this goal of zero and take corrective actions to get back on track whenever necessary.\n\n      Our primary focus is on prevention of any accidental releases.  However, we have strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  We use this combination of prevention programs and emergency response capability to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. \n\n      This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n-   A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA)  Risk Management Program regulation;\n-   A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n-   An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n-   An overview of our emergency response program;\n-   A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the TCPA rule;\n-   An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment;\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n      The DuPont Chambers Works facility first opened in the early 1900's as a dye manufacturing plant.  We now produce in excess of 500 different products using a variety of chemicals and processing"

Scenario information similar to that described below has been used on Chambers Works for many years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help us continuously improve our processes and reduce risk.  We continue to do these assessments as part of our internal process safety management systems.\n\n      The EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical.  The scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\n      Using the methods described by the EPA, the worst case release of a flammable chemical from Chambers Works would be the release of the entire content"

The pressure wave generated from the explosion would barely leave the site boundary.   This event would not be expected to expose the public to the amount of pressure of concern to the EPA or NJ, but an explosion like this would be heard and possibly felt off the Chambers Works site.\n\n      Also using the methods described by the EPA, the worst case toxic scenario is the release of the entire contents of a chlorine railcar in a 10-minute period.  Using EPA guidelines, a release like this could significantly impact the public off  the Chambers Works site.  Depending on the wind direction at the time of the release, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland or Pennsylvania could be effected.  \n\n      The worst case scenarios described above underscore the need for very rigorous process safety management systems.  It is important to note however, that none of the prevention and mitigation equipment, practices, and procedures that have been put in place by DuPont Chambers Works to prevent or respond to releases such as these are taken into account for these worst case scenarios.  \n\n      In order to facilitate emergency response planning with the community, TCPA and the EPA has included the requirement for companies to report alternate case scenarios.  These alternate case scenarios provide a realistic picture of what could actually happen if the safety systems used by a facility were to fail.\n\n      TCPA requires that companies include one alternate release scenario for regulated flammables as a group and one for each regulated toxic chemical.  This is because the impact of a flammable scenario on the public is expected to be similar for all the different types of flammables.   The toxic chemicals can vary in their effects and so must be reviewed individually.  In the data elements section of this report you"

      "SummaryText": " will find a detailed description of all these alternate release scenarios.\n\n      The alternate case for flammables on Chambers Works is the complete, catastrophic failure of an unloading flex hose while transferring vinylidene chloride to the storage tank.  In this scenario, 419 pounds of vinylidene chloride is released and ignited, resulting in a flash fire.  This scenario has an impact distance of about 300 feet and does not extend off-site.  Of course, we still have accident prevention activities in place to protect our employees from injury.\n\n      The largest and most significant toxic alternate case scenario for DuPont Chambers Works is a large leak at the man-way cover gasket on our 67% Oleum storage tank.  This could result in over 1,000 pounds of Oleum spilled into the tank secondary containment.  Under the normal weather conditions at the site, this release could go almost a mile before the toxic concentration falls below a level of concern.  Because of the tank location, about a half mile of the release distance is off the Chambers Works site.  The chemical would travel in the direction of the wind, and be more concentrated closer to the site.   Depending on the wind direction, the release could impact residences and a small park just outside the plant fence line.  It could also impact several businesses and restaurants along Route 130 near the Chambers Works site, and the NJ Turnpike approach to the Delaware Memorial Bridge.\n\n      Knowing the impact of a release like this, DuPont Chambers Works has many things in place to prevent releases from ever occurring.  For this release scenario, examples of preventive measures include:\n-   An understanding of process technology to make sure the design and materials of construction of the tank, gasket and all the other components are more than adequate;\n-   Mechanical training and procedures to ensure that tank components are installed correctly; \n-   Quality assurance programs to make sure the right replacemen"

They are able to respond to any releases we might have and mitigate the impact.
