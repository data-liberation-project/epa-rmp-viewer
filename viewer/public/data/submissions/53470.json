      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nAs mandated by 40 CFR Part 68 Subchapter C, the Morgan City Water Treatment Plant (MCWTP) is required to have a Risk Management Program, and submit to the EPA a Risk Management Plan.  MCWTP has always had safety practices, proper maintenance, training and emergency preparedness, but this Risk Management Program will bring all of those aspects together into one comprehensive program.  The full text of the EPA RMP regulations is available on the Internet through EPA\u00bfs website:  http://yosemite.epa.gov/oswer/ceppoweb.nsf/content/RMPoverview.htm.\r\n\r\n        II.\tRegistration Information\r\nThis section provides information on MCWTP\u00bfs Parent company, location, contacts, and identifying numbers.\r\n\r\nIII. Responsible Employee\r\nByron Thronson, Plant Supervisor, is responsible for implementation of the PMR program.\r\n\r\nIV. Hazard Assessment\r\na. Worst Case Scenario\r\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the explosion or other sudden release of an entire 2000-lb cylinder of chlorine gas.  In this case, the gas would travel about 0.9 miles away from the facility before dispersing enough to no longer pose a health hazard.  The affected population with that radius would be approximately 6000 persons.\r\nb. Alternative Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario would be a more likely release event, such as a leak in the regulator hose of a cylinder.  This scenario examines a release of approximately 317-lbs of chlorine gas, which would disperse enough to cease to pose a threat to human health at about 0.1 miles out from the facility.  The affected population is this 0.1-mile radius would be approximately 80 persons. \r\nc. Five year accident History\r\nIn the past five years, there have been no reportable accidents at the MCWTP.  \r\n\r\nV. Accident Prevention Management System\r\na. Safety Information\r\nThis section provides an inventory sheet and MSDS for the covered chemical, chlorine.  Also detailed here are the safety limits for the storage and handlin"

There is a form here to detail any major changes in the facility or operation, the year installed, and the codes or standards used.  As of now there have been no major changes in the facility in over 30 years, but this blank form is here for future use.  Information about chlorine process safety, safety equipment and safety procedures is provided here.\r\nb. Hazard Review\r\nThe MCWTP conducts a hazard review every five years, or with each major change, to identify any and all hazards associated with the process.  They look for opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error.  This hazard review also determines the presence or absence of safeguards needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error.  One of the functions of the hazard review is to identify any steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.  The purpose of these reviews is to promote constant awareness and to decrease the risk potentials in our facility.  The hazard reviews are to be completed, dated, signed and kept on file.\r\nc. Operating Procedures\r\nThe MCWTP conducts a review of all operating procedures, if necessary, each time a major change occurs and prior to startup of the changed process.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that the operation procedures reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment, and changes to stationary sources.  This section of the RMP Program manual contains references to help you find all operating procedures used by Morgan City Water, and also contains the specific procedures used by employees.  Operations procedures from the facility\u00bfs operations and maintenance manual are located in this section. \r\nd. Training\r\nMorgan City Water provides initial, thorough training for each new employee involved in operating a process.  The training emphasize"
