In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nAmmonia\n\nEpichlorohydrin\n\nFormaldehyde (solution)\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nDimethylamine\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\n3.0 Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about release scenarios for our facility"

One inch hole in transportation vessel with minimal mitigation\n\n?    Two inch hose or pipe failure with minimal mitigation\n\n?    One or two inch pipe/hose failure inside building with minimal mitigation.\n\n\n\nThe following are brief summaries of the scenario for each chemical with farthest impact distance:\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\n\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of a 2 inch hose or pipe while transferring ammonia.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA (Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), RMP*Comp estimates that the ammonia could travel 0.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the communities of Mt. Airy and Garyville, and one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures were used during this scenario. \n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile\n\n\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of a 2 inch hose or pipe while transferring acrylonitrile.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA (Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), RMP*Comp estimates that the acrylonitrile could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the communities of Mt. Airy and Garyville, and one industrial facility.  Active and passive mitigation measures were used during this scenario.\n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin\n\n\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of a 2 inch hose or pipe while transferring epichlorohydrin.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA (Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), RMP*Comp estimates that the epichlorohydrin could travel 0.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.

Active and passive mitigation measures were used during this scenario.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde\n\n\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of a 2 inch hose or pipe while transferring a formaldehyde solution.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA (Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the formaldehyde could travel 1.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the communities of Mt. Airy and Garyville, and one industrial facility.  Active and passive mitigation measures were used during this scenario.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nDimethylamine\n\n\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of a 2 inch hose or pipe while transferring dimethylamine.  RMP*Comp estimates that, if the release were to result in a vapor cloud explosion, it would affect an area within 0.1 miles of the tank.  This area would be contained within the confines of the Nalco facility.   Active mitigation measures were used during this scenario.\n\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\n\n\n \n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n? Process safety information\n\n? Process hazard analysis\n\n? Operating procedures\n\n? Training\n\n? Mechanical integrity\n\n? Management of change\n\n? Pre-startup review\n\n? Compliance audits\n\n? Incident investigation\n\n? Employee participation\n\n? Hot work permit\n\n? Contractors\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemi"

These inspections include the transfer hoses used for unloading acrylonitrile, ammonia, dimethylamine, epichlorohydrin, and formaldehyde.\n\n\n\nWritten procedures to address unloading, leak detection and spill reporting in the acrylonitrile, ammonia, dimethylamine, epichlorohydrin, and formaldehyde unloading and storage areas.\n\n\n\nSpecific emergency instructions have been included in the D/3 computer \"notebook\" used to control production processes.\n\n\n\nDrain covers have been purchased to improve spill control within the plant drainage system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n \n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History \n\n\n\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years (2011 - present):\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental chemical release involving ammonia above its Reportable Quantity (RQ) at our facility in the last five years.  A small hole in the unloading hose released an estimated 135 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There have also been small releases of acrylonitrile, ammonia"

After each of these incidents, we conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  None of these incidents met the requirements to be reported under EPA's RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nWe maintain a contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0 Certifications\n\n\n\nFor all covered processes, the undersigned also certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in this RMPlan is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nRafael Pons\n\nPlant Manager\n\nJuly 15, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNalco Garyville RMP executive summary 7-2016.doc\n\n"
