Facility Policy.\n\n        The owners, management and employees of US Ag Center are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,   Butler  County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n        The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.      Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere has been an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility. It occurred  on July 28, 2006 and involved the loss of approximately 400 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  No one was injured and the residents of Kesley were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  Complete information on the incident is available in section 6 and in our risk management program.\n\n6.       Emergency Action Plan.\n\n          The facility has:\n\n           a.     A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard \n                   29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.     Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and \n                   Community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III \n       "

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, \n                   the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and \n                   call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our\n                   Emergency Action Plan.\n\n7.       Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions OF THE FACILILTY.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
