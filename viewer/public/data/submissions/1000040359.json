      "SummaryText": "s annual site emergency response drills and other exercises that have been conducted jointly with the local public safety response groups.\r\n\r\nThe Geismar site utilizes audible warning systems for both onsite and offsite notification. The onsite notification system can be activated at several locations including control rooms and the plant security gate. This system has siren and voice capability that can use prerecorded or live announcements. The system is tested weekly and during routine drills by Honeywell and other companies which share the site.\r\n\r\nNotification of persons off the site property is accomplished in conjunction with the local public safety agencies by activation of a regional audible warning system. This system also has siren and voice capabilities. Annually, calendars are hand delivered to residents in the audible warning region. These calendars provide residents instructions and recommendations in response to audible warnings. The system is tested weekly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the audible warning system, community alert networks exist to alert near neighbors. These computer-assisted systems are capable of automatically alerting residents, industries, businesses, and others in the covered area by telephone.\r\n\r\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nHoneywell pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations. Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.\r\n\r\nThe plant's systematic safety review program identifies action items that improve upon the existing safeguards at the Geismar site and further reduce the potential for accidental release. The process hazard analyses for the Geismar manufacturing processes are reviewed and revalidated every five years. Continuous improvement of the plant's processes and systems provides the highest level of protection from chemical incidents."
