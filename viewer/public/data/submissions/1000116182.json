The facility utilizes in-house Maintenance Mechanics for Daily Ammonia System Rounds (w/ log sheet) to monitor system parameters and to alert the refrigeration contractor if any conditions are out of range.

In addition, all pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to ensure the integrity of the vessel and associated piping is protected.

This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at the CTI Foods facility in Azusa, California.\n\nIt is the policy of CTI Foods to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  CTI Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The policy is reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains an accurate reflection of the facility's policies regarding evacuation and the protocol to deal with emergency scenarios.\n\nCTI Foods coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of CTI Foods to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The CTI Foods Chief Engineer and Maintenance Manager will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe CTI Foods facility began operation of the facility in 1998.

It was designed with the intent of switching refrigerants to ammonia so that very few equipment/piping modifications were necessary.  The initial charge of anhydrous ammonia was received by the facility at the time that the Phase 3 expansion was finalized which included the addition of a process spiral freezer (IQF), several evaporators for new cold rooms, one compressor, and two vessels.  The refrigeration system was shut down, purged of R-22, and restarted using ammonia in November 2000.\n\nThe facility is a meat manufacturing plant that supplies product to fast-food establishments.  The facility is located at 1120 W. Foothill Blvd. in Azusa, California, just north of the Interstate 210 freeway, between Irwindale Avenue and Vernon Avenue.  The immediate area is primarily commercial with some light industrial and residential areas.  The refrigeration system was upgraded to meet the requirements of the current applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes, as well as the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations that govern the handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The refrigeration system maintains low temperatures for cold storage and for blast freezing product.  The cold storage areas include: Finished Goods, Raw Goods, Blend/Grind, Dock, Freezer, IQF (Individual Quick Freeze), Fajita Process.  There are also multiple spiral freezers that are used to deep freeze meet products for distribution.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSV-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-1), which is the main liquid storage ve"

The HPR transfers high pressure liquid through the Intercooler (IC-1) in order to subcool it prior to routing to each of three Low Pressure Receivers (LPR-1, LPR-2, LPR-3).  Each Low Pressure Receiver operates an independent system with a specific process or storage freezer(s).  The HPR also supplies high pressure liquid to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR-1), which maintains a constant pressure through the use of pressure regulating valves.  CPR-1 is the main liquid supply vessel for the evaporators.  As the liquid ammonia enters the various evaporator/freezer coils, it expands, reducing the temperature.\n\nAs heat from the room (or product in the Spiral Freezers) is transferred to the low temperature liquid ammonia in the coils, the ammonia is (partially) vaporized.  The suction from the evaporators is pulled to the Suction Accumulator vessel (AC-1).  The suction from each of the spiral freezers is returned to the corresponding Low Pressure Receiver.  Four compressors (HC-1, HC-2, LC-1, and BC-1) pull the gaseous ammonia from the suction vessels and work in combination to compress the low pressure ammonia to high pressure gas (hot gas).  The hot gas is discharged through a common header to the Condensers (EC-1, EC-2, EC-3), where fans and sprayed water are used to condense the ammonia in the coils back into a liquid.  As the heat from the ammonia vapor is rejected to the atmosphere, the ammonia changes phase into liquid and drains by gravity into TSV-1.\n\nHot gas (high stage compressor discharge) is also used for defrost in the evaporators and for pressurizing liquid transfer vessels associated with the recirculator vessels.  The system also has a Water Diffusion Tank (into which a common relief header vents), which is kept full of water in order to neutralize any ammonia vapor that is vented.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies a"
