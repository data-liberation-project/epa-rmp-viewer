The facility maintains freezer storage spaces of nearly 4 million cubic ft. which is used to store perishable products.  Storage areas at the facility operate at 0\u00b0F to -5\u00b0F.  The facility has nine truck loading and unloading spots and five railcar spots to facilitate the transportation of products.  A mechanical refrigeration system, utilizing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, is used to maintain desired temperatures.  The refrigeration system operates in a closed loop; the ammonia is not mixed with other chemicals.\n\nFACILITY CONSTRUCTION:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with mechanical and building codes in effect at the time of the various phases of construction.  These codes outline requirements for the safe installation and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nSAFETY FEATURES:  The ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Safeties include, but are not limited to: pressure relief valves, stop valves, ammonia detectors, a computerized refrigeration monitoring and control system, as well as trained and experienced operators.  Much of the safety associated with the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern its operation.   For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68). \n\nMANAGEMENT COMMITMENT TO SAFETY:  Lineage Logistics has a long standing commitment to worker, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\nT"
