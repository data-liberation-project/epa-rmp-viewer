      "SummaryText": "Facilities and Regulated Substances\r\nThe John Flannagan Water Authority is located on Virginia Route 614, address 552 Flannagan Dam Road, Haysi, VA, in Dickenson County.  It's facilities are in the treatment of water for distribution to Buchanan and Dickenson Counties.  It has been in operation since 1980 without any hazardous materials incidents.  The only chemical that the Authority uses that comes under this regulation is chlorine.  We have on site anywhere from 2-4 ton cylinders at any given time.  Chlorine is stored in it's own room with an outside entrance.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention\r\nThe Authority has the chlorine stored in a locked separate room with it's own ventilation system.  There is constant monitoring for chlorine feed rates and also for leak detection.  Each is attached to an audible alarm system that sounds in the event of an alarm.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Policies\r\nThe Authority's Response Plan states that all releases will be reported.  Agencies include the Virginia Department of Health, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Local Emergency Services Office and the Local Fire and Rescue Agencies.  The Authority owns and maintains a chlorine repair kit for ton cylinders and has SCBA fir entry to hazardous atomspheres.  The Authority's policy in the event of a major leak is to contact the local emergency response agencies by telephone, these include law enforcement, fire, rescue and hazardous materials response teams.  There are only 6 residences within the worst case release scenerio and the plan calls for their evacuation.  There is also a recreation area at the very outer limits of the release zone.  There could be anywhere from 0-50 people at this site at any given time.  Normal occupancy would be in the range of 0-10.  These people would be evacuated by face to face communications.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThe Authority use the program RMP Comp to determine our worst case and alternative scenarios.

      "SummaryText": "th the worst case scenario, the Authority would lose the entire contents of one (1) ton cylinder.  This release would travel a distance of approximately 0.90 miles (1.4 km).  Within this area are only 6 residences and a recreation area.  As chlorine is heavier than air and our topographical nature is mountainous, the most likely movement of any release would be downhill towards the John Flannagan Reservoir.  With the alternative release scenario, the Authority would lose approximately 1,500 pounds.  The release would travel a distance of approximately 0.1 miles (0.2 km).  This release would stay with the confines of the Authority's property and affect no outside population.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Authority trains all personnel in the safe handling of chlorine and maintenance of chlorine feed and handling systems.  All cylinders are stored in individual stands to prevent accident movement.  Cylinders are moved from one place to another by means of a hoist system.  The Authority has a constant monitor system for feed rates and accidental release with audible alarms.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe Authority has not had any reportable quantity releases of chlorine since operation began in 1980.  All personnel have been trained in the safe handling and use of chlorine.  This includes proper handling and placement of cylinders, proper methods of attaching and detaching the chemical feed lines, use of SCBA and the use of the chlorine cylinder repair kit.  Training is obtained by means of on-the-job training as well as seminars through the AWWA, Virginia Rural Water Association and chemical suppliers.  Currently seven (7) employees are Virginia certified as either Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3 Water Works Operators.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Authority developed an emergency response program to meet the requirements of SARA Title III requirements.  This involves a coordinated response from local law, fire, rescue and hazardous response team"
