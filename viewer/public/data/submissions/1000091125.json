The regulated substances handled at this site are Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nWoodward Iodine Corporation has implemented an accidental release prevention policy to prevent accidental releases and comply with EPA RMP.  The accidental release prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n?    Process Safety Information, which includes an SDS sheets for chlorine, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide, safety information for the CL2, SO2, & NH3 system and process chemistry for the CL2, SO2, & NH3 process; maximum intended inventory of CL2, SO2, & NH3 handled onsite; Process Flow Diagrams, these are detailed drawings of the piping, instrumentation and process flow; Design Codes and Standards including manuals and other indexes and handbooks.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis, which includes process hazard analysis for the CL2, SO2, & NH3 system.  It presents different release scenarios and an assessment of associated risk (based on estimated likelihood and consequences).\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures, which include detailed instructions on operating the CL2, SO2, & NH3 process, including normal startup, operations, and shutdown, as well as emergency operations including emergency shutdown and startup following a turnaround or an emergency shutdown.\n\n?    Incident/Accident Investigations and Procedures which includes reports of all accidents or near miss occurrences, as well as documentation of follow-up corrective actions; \n\n?    Emergency Response Plan which describes how we handle emergencies.\n\n?    Training of operators and maintenance personnel; \n\n?    Mechanical Integrity program, which includes inspection, testing and preventative maintenance of critical equipment in order to prevent failure;\n\n?
