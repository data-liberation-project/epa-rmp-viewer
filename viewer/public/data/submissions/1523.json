If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the St. Marys Fire Department and the Pottawatomie County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of  the release to people and the environment. The primary function of the St. Marys Anyhdrous Ammonia facility is the storage and distribution of the product to our customers, Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application of the product as a plant nutrient by our customers. The maximumn quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored is 165,000 pounds in our 26,000 and 11,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank unloading 40,000 pounds. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of 116,025 pounds of product over a ten minute period from our largeststorage tank. The alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose releasing 2,900 pounds of product over a two minute period. The distance to the endpoint in both instances would be approximately 2.6 miles. The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia according to U. S. and State Government requirements. There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia at the St. Marys Facility that have causes any deaths, injuries, or property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.
