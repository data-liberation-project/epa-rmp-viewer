The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals (Vinyl Acetate)\n\nOur worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of the waste fuels tank.  This tank is a nominal 38,000 gallon tank and is contained within a concrete dike.  It is assumed that the contents of the tank would be released within 10 minutes.  The maximum concentration of vinyl acetate in the waste fuels received at Beaumont is 50%.  The estimated exposure distance (distance to ERPG 2 concentration) is 0.5 miles. (The estimated exposure distance before rounding is 0.46 mile.)  This could potentially impact public receptors such as residences,  Lamar University, and local industries and businesses within the 0.5 mile circle.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals (Vinyl Acetate)\n\nThe alternate release scenario for vinyl acetate is a transfer hose failure during the unloading of a waste fuels tank truck. It assumed that 2670 lbs. vinyl acetate would be spilled in a 30 minute period.  The estimated exposure distance (ERPG 2 concentration) is 0.10 miles. (The estimated exposure distance before rounding is 0.07 miles.)  This should not impact the Lamar University football stadium or basketball arena (Montagne Center) or other off site receptors.However, due to the closeness of the Lamar facilities, they should be considered in emergency planning activities.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs includin"

All unloading operations are actively monitored\n2.  Plant operating personnel perform daily visual inspections of equipment.\n3.  Plant operating personnel perform weekly leak checks for fugitive emissions from pumps, valves, flanges, etc.\n4. The waste fuels tank is located within a secondary containment dike. Tank integrity is checked at least annually by an outside contractor.\n5. The waste fuel system is highly automated and will automatically shut down during certain furnace problems or upset conditions. \n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. The Peak Sulfur goal is to have ZERO incidents- zero distribution, zero safety, and zero environmental incidents.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all significant incidents that occur at our facility-whether they are safety or environmental release related.
