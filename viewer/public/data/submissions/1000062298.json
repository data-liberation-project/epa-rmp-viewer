      "SummaryText": "TJM Innovations manufactures polyurethane foam gutter filters.  TJM recently installed a system consisting of four 6,000-gallon bulk storage tanks for the raw materials (TDI and polyol), two 500-gallon day tanks for supplying TDI to the equipment, a JFlex machine which manufactures the foam, as well as piping, pumps, and other supporting equipment.  One 6,000-gallon tank holds TDI80 and one 6,000-gallon tank holds TDI65 which each contain 2,4-toluene diisocyanate and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate in different ratios.\n\n\n\nThe tanks are located within a concrete diked system, inside the building.  TJM evaluated a worst-case release of the entire contents of one of the 6,000-gallon tanks as well as an alternate release of a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose.  There are no residences, schools, hospitals, etc. within the 0.1 mile distance to endpoint for either scenario.\n\n\n\nThe system incorporates various safety measures such as high level alarms, shut-offs, and interlocks.  An emergency generator has been installed to ensure ventilation and lighting during a power outage.  There are spill kits as well as a drain cover and absorbent material available on-site.  In addition, TJM is contracting with an emergency spill response company.\n\n\n\nTJM has developed standard operating procedures, maintenance procedures, emergency response procedures, and a training program.  Training has been provided and an emergency drill has been conducted."
