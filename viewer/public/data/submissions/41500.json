      "SummaryText": "Boyd Fertilizer, Inc. has served the farming community in Sylvania, Georgia since 1967. We are revising and updating a comprehensive emergency response plan and an accident prevention program in place at  our faciliy in response to the new RMP program.  We cooperate with public emergency planning agencies on a regular basis to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release.  All of our employees attend procedural safety and emergency response classes.  This policy has allowed us to remain accident free for more than five years.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank farm is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe reliable operation.  The last comprehensive facility inspection was on June 1, 1999.   Safety placards are placed  on the tanks, and at fill stations.   The facility's 1-12,000 and 1-18000 gallon tanks are all equipped with pressure relief valves and gauges to prevent overpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with excess flow devices that will automatically shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  The tanks and pipes also feature manual shutoff valves to stop and isolate a leak so that it can be repaired.  The facility has a water purging system to clear any extraneous product from the transfer lines after use.  There is a water supply is located at the fill station.\n\nThe worst case scenario indicates that businesses and residences offsite will be affected in the event of a catastrophic release.  However we believe that our vigorous safety and emergency response programs greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario from happening.  The alternative case release scenario is a more accurate assessment of any risk posed to the community."
