The facility is located on 13136 Highway 28 West.  It is adjacent to a Georgia-Pacific Plywood mill.  A Georgia-Pacific Stud Mill and Roseburg Particleboard plant are also within the same manufacturing complex. The resin facility consists of three plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1972, a plant that manufactures formaldehyde that was originally constructed in 1973 (formaldehyde is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins), and a spray-dry resin plant that was constructed in 1996.  Overall, the facility employs 52 full-time employees.\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Georgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\n\n\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n?A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.

When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nGeorgia-Pacific Chemicals LLC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.

The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.9   Incident Investigation - The Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.10   Employee Participation - The Plant developed a written employee participation program for all covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's workers "

Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.11   Hot Work Permits - The Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant's safe work practices orientation.\n\n\n\n1.3.1.12   Contractors - The Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.  The following paragraphs describe some of these features.\n\n\n\nAmmonia solution-Industry "

The ammonia solution is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors and stored in the plant's designated storage vessel. The ammonia vendor supplies ammonia solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank's design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for ammonia developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled.\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Most of the formaldehyde stored in the plant's storage vessels is piped directly from the formaldehyde plant.  However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tanks.  The storage tanks' design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tanks are directed to an oxidizer, which destroys in excess of 98% of the formaldehyde emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history for the plant.
