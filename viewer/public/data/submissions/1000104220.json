This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4. Five year accident history:\nThere have been no accidents involving accidental releases of flammable gas at this facility in the past 5 years. \n\n5. The emergency response program:\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside emergency response teams. Employees have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The employees will receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities will be coordinated with Covestro's Emergency Response Team.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nAt this facility, we manufacturer gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and methane, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other control systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. Our emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulations. The emergency response plan includes procedures and the notification of the Covestro Emergency Response Team so that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases. This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas). Our customer uses carbon monoxide gas. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock. The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace. By exposing the feedstock catalyst in the presence of heat (~1,800 F) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from the hydrogen in a Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) system. T"
