The Georgetown County Water And Sewer District follows the EPA guidelines for Risk Management and the guidelines established by OSHA for Process Safety Management.  The two codes require the District to evaluate the on and off site risks associated with a highly hazardous chemical and ensure that proper precautions and plans are implemented to minimize the impact of such release.  The District completed a Process Hazard Analysis to review the causes and effects of a chemical release.  To aid in the prevention of a leak, the District has established a preventative maintenance program to keep the chlorine equipment in optimum condition.  Any equipment not in proper working order is immediately evaluated for repair or replacement.  In addition to a preventative maintenance program, the District has established standard operating procedures in conjunction with the Chlorine Institute and manufacturer's recommendations.  Employees are required to follow the standard procedures at the plant, especially near a highly hazardous chemical area.  All employees are trained prior to exposure to equipment and provided refresher training at least every three years.  Chemical awareness is discussed both in training and during safety meetings where employees can discuss any hazards or potential hazards of the chlorine system.  Chemical specific prevention steps include the installation of the gas monitors and alarm system.  Self-contained breathing apparatus, gloves, goggles and aprons are available for employees for protection against a chlorine leak.\n  \n4.  The Pawleys Island Wastewater Treatment Plant is covered under the Georgetown County Water And Sewer District's Emergency Response Plan.

The District is committed to providing Georgetown County employees a safe working environment.  To ensure this environment, the District has establish safe working practices, standard operating procedures, and accident prevention programs.  Management is dedicated to training employees on proper operating procedures, emergency response, and equipment use.  Georgetown County Water and Sewer District has addressed the need for evacuation and response due to a chlorine release by coordinating with Local Fire Department's Emergency Response Team, and maintaining its own emergency response team for support, to respond and control spills or leaks of chlorine. The distances determined through the release scenarios determined the emergency response plan requirements.\n\n2.  The Pawleys Island Wastewater Treatment Plant treats domestic and industrial wastewater from the surrounding area.  The plant consist of a bar screen and grit chamber, pre-aeration tanks, primary clarifier, sludge holding tank, aeration basins, three secondary clarifiers, a chlorine contact chamber, dechlorination chamber and two belt presses for sludge handling.  The chlorination system, installed at the plant to disinfect the effluent flow before discharging the treated wastewater into the Waccamaw River, is housed in a chlorination building where the chlorinators, safety equipment and instrumentation are located.  The plant is equipped to use chlorine from one-ton containers under normal operation.  The chlorine is fed as a gas from one-ton containers to a chlorinator which mixes the gas with a stream of water.  The resultant chlorine solution is fed to a mix chamber adjacent to the chlorine contact tanks.  The feed rate is controlled by an effluent flowmeter signal to ensure a constant chlorine concentration over the full range of plan"
