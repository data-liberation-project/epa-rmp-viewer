The Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal is located approximately (5) miles south of Texas City and is involved in the transportation and distribution of chemicals and products. In accordance with U.S. EPA regulation 40 CFR 68, the U.S. EPA has identified quantities for 140 toxic or flammable substances that require a facility to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule when unit inventories exceed threshold quantities. The RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) every five (5) years or six (6) months after an RMP reportable incident. The initial submittal of the RMPlan for Oiltanking Texas City was in November 2004.  This submittal serves to update information based on a recent compliance audit and EPA RMP inspection.  Oiltanking Texas City currently holds the following RMP-regulated substances above threshold quantities:\n\nTable 1\n\nRegulated Chemical                              CAS Number         Characteristic      Threshold (lbs)\nVinyl Acetate Monomer                            108-05-4                 Toxic                  15,000\nEthylenediamine [1,2-Ethanediamine]        107-15-3                 Toxic                  20,000\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis\n40 CFR 68 requires all facilities, subject to the rule, to conduct an offsite consequence analysis to provide information about any potential consequ"

      "SummaryText": "ences of an accidental chemical release to the public and state and federal environmental agencies.  Offsite consequence analyses are essential in identifying potential hazards of accidental release.  The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) comprises 2 elements, a worst-case scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nOffsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) were conducted using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines. The RMP sets forth specific criteria that must be incorporated in modeling the worst-case scenarios. The EPA defines a WCS as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint. As defined by the rule, the endpoint for a toxic substance is a specified concentration while for flammables it is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).\n\nThe scenarios for the Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal were calculated using the RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (EPA 550-B-99-009).  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nThe WCS for vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is the total failure of a 3,000,000-gal tank, which would lead to the release of 23,500,000 lbs of VAM.  Based on the release rate and VAM characteristics, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 25 miles.  This includes a population of approximately 550,000.\n\nThe WCS for ethylenediamine (EDA) is the total failure of a 210,000-gal tank, which would lead to the release of 1,593,060 lbs of EDA.  Based on the release rate and EDA characteristics, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 8.1 miles (less than that for VAM).  This includes a population of approximately 69,000.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS) assess the potential "

The RMP Guidelines for Offsite Consequence Analysis were used in modeling the alternative release scenarios.  As required, an alternative release scenario was created for toxics. This scenario was calculated using the RMP Guidelines for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences should an incident occur, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nThe ARS for vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is a pipe leak in which the contents in a 540-foot section of 6-inch diameter pipe were all released.  This would lead to the release of 6,180 lbs of VAM.  Based on the release rate and VAM characteristics, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles.  This radius only includes the Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal and does not include any populated locations.\n\nThe ARS for ethylenediamine (EDA) is a pipe leak in which the contents in a 540-foot section of 6-inch diameter pipe were all released.  This would lead to the release of 6,017 lbs of EDA.  Based on the release rate and VAM characteristics, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles (less than that for VAM).  This radius only includes the Oiltanking Texas City Marine Terminal and does not include any populated locations.\n\n\nFive- Year Accident History\n\nOiltanking Texas City, in the past five (5) years, has not incurred any chemical releases that resulted in any known onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, significant damage, evacuations or sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.   \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nThe plans for evacuation and accounting for personnel after an evacuation at Oiltanking Texas City are located onsite for all personnel to review.\n\nIf a release occurs, arrangements are described in "
