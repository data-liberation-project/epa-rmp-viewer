NGL's are loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only.

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under\nthe regulation.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the\nhigh standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\n\u00c2\u00b7 Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00c2\u00b7 Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation\nand maintenance will be minimized to th"

Analysis of the potential hazards\nof the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release\naccidents since Plains purchased the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking\nsteps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility has had no accidents in the last five years.\nEmergency Response Program\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency\nresponse groups such as the Paul Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the\nterminal would be the Conecuh County Sheriff. The\nterminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency\nresponse. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers,\nthe public, and the environment during emergency situations.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety\nmanagement systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key\ncomponents of the safety program are:\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change\nmade to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential\nhazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed,\nconstructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous re"
