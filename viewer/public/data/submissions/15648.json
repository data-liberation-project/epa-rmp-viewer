WORKERS IN THE AMMONMIA PLANT ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND WEAR THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nTHE SAFETY RECORD OF THIS COMPANY IS VERY EVIDENT, AND ALLOWS US TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURED AT THE STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'VE TOURED OUR FACILITY TO MAKE THEM MORE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ACCIDENT THAT MAY OCCUR."
