Procedures and practices related to the maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment are also in place.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \n\nSite-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTypes of RMP site specific prevention steps include the following:\n\nRelease detection\n- Various process alarms\n- Operator surveillance\n- Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment;\n\nRelease containment and control\n- Various relief systems \n- Dikes to contain liquid releases\n- Redundant equipment (i.e. back-up firewater pump)\n- Control valves to allow isolation of the process;\n\nRelease Mitigation  \n- Area firewater monitors\n- Mobile emergency response equipment\n- Trained emergency response personnel.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe facility strives to improve the safety of plant processes through periodic safety reviews, the Incident Investigation Program, safety campaigns, and employee feedback.

This coordination includes periodic committee meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, community members, and industry representatives.  Trained and equipped site firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams are available.  There is a 24 hour communications capability with DEP officials, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire departments, Sheriff's department, State Police, etc.).  In addition to established lines of communication with area emergency response organizations, the site is also a member of the St. Charles Parish Industrial Mutual Aid Association.  Periodic emergency drills are held with the LEPC, DEP, Mutual Aid Organization members, and local emergency response organizations.  Refresher information that is related to the RMP regulated substances is also made available to local emergency response organizations.\n\nThe DEP is responsible for maintaining written plans for the preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery of any natural or technological disaster that may occur in St. Charles Parish.

The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change. The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community. The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented. The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\n\nAn RMP Compliance audit is required to be conducted every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit team's findings developed in a report.

Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training. Operator training is required to be documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator. The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information. Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The following is a summary of some of these measures:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nA Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant's process units. Typically, the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs. PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed. PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved. PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.
