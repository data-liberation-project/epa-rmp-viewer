Fresh Mark Salem's directors, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Fresh Mark Salem has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  Fresh Mark Salem will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFresh Mark Salem is a further processing facility.  Meat is received and processed for human consumption.  To preserve the meat and prevent bacteria contamination, an extremely hazardous substance is utilized, anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFresh Mark Salem has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  Fresh Mark Salem has aggressively developed programs, policies and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with highly hazardous materials.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nFresh Mark Salem has not had a reportable accidental release of ammonia during the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAn on-site emergency response team is trained to respond to releases and effectively minimize the release.  Training for emergency response team members is conducted at least annually with mock drills being conducted at least biannually.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include: improved maintenance procedures and periodicity; addition of new technology as it becomes available and continued training of facility and response personnel."
