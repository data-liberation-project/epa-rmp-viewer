All\r\nplant configuration, operations and emergency response practices are managed using company standard\r\noperating procedures which are a part of the Company Management Systems described below.\r\n\r\nQuality System (QS)\r\nStandard operating procedures for all production and related services are managed using an ISO 9001\r\ncertified Quality System. The Quality System has been certified since 1994.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\r\nAll environmental program procedures are included in an Environmental Management System that achieved\r\ncertification under to the ISO 14001 Standard. The RMP is a program procedure under the EMS. Emergency response plans are also resident here.\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Management System (HSMS)\r\nAll Health and Safety written programs are already installed and controlled in the Management Systems\r\nprocess used by the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 programs. The existing Safety Incentive Plan implements\r\nsystematic methods for monitoring and improvement of health and safety requirements and issues. The\r\nstructure is modeled on of the ANZI-Z10 program, and certification will be sought should this credential\r\nreceive wide acceptance.\r\n\r\nPolicy\r\nChemTreat is well aware that our business requires the management of certain hazardous chemicals, which if\r\nnot properly controlled, introduce increased potential for harm to employees, the community and the\r\nenvironment. Accordingly, we have established systematic procedures to evaluate potential risks, establish\r\nprocedures to manage those risks on a priority basis, and review and update our programs as conditions or\r\ncapabilities change.

Hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals that are\r\nused in the blending process are stored in specifically designed and engineered storage and processing\r\nequipment.

The most important products of our reviews are recommendations for reducing\r\nthe most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.
