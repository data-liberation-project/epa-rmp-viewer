This is \naccomplished through a systematic and periodic evaluation of process design, process \ntechnology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency \npreparedness and training.  \n\nAlthough the EPA\u0012s RMP was recently promulgated RMC\u0012s commitment to safety is reflected in \nthe operating history of the plant.  The Propane and Chlorine systems in place at RMC, covered \nby the RMP rule, have been in operation for at least 20 years. During that time there have been \nno releases to the environment that have resulted in injuries to workers or the public. \n\nTo continue to assure Chlorine or Propane releases are prevented or will not result in adverse \nimpacts programs have been developed and implemented. The Chlorine and Propane system \nprograms comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly \nHazardous Chemicals for Chlorine and Propane, and EPA's 40 CFR part 68 subpart D, \nAccidental Release Prevention Provisions in the Risk Management Program.

As part of its prevention program, RMC has automatic release mitigation \nsystems in place to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.\nRMC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an \naccidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence \nanalysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release \nscenarios.  For all worst case and alternative case release scenarios for chlorine, the EPA \napproved Degadis model was used to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint \ndefined in Appendix A of the RMP rule.  For propane, EPA\u0012s RMPComp computer \nmodeling program was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure, the offsite \nconsequence analysis parameter defined in the RMP rule.  These models are considered \nconservative and would generally give longer distances, that is cover a larger area, than \ncomputer models developed specifically for the RMC.\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis for the Chlorine \nand Propane systems performed by RMC\nChlorine Alternative Case Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine, considered by RMC to be more likely to \noccur than the worst case, is a leaky valve or gasket which results in the release of 100 \npounds of chlorine in an hour.  This scenario could occur only if there were a failure of \nthe detection systems at the facility and occurred during hours with less staff on site \nand when the guard was on rounds.
