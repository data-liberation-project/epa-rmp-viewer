This facility is a plastics manufacturing plant.  We use different materials to make these plastic parts.  We use melamine powder, which has a small amount of formaldehyde, plus material that contains a small amount of phenol.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  Our worst-case scenario is an explosion or fire, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles, and 0.4 miles.  There are several private homes and industrial businesses within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of approximately 250 people.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The materials stored and emergency fire alarm system is maintained by Honeywell in accordance with all state and federal laws.  Honeywell monitors our alarm system from Milwaukee.\n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving any of our stored materials that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our stored materials, it is our policy to notify the Fredonia Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.
