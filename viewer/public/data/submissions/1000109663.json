The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidation.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Aera periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to local management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) an energy control  procedure to ensure the safe isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a Hot Work Permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely through Aera\u0092s Control of Work Process. \n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nAera has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAera investigates incidents that result in or could have potentially resulted in a serious injury or fatality, which includes near misses.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a process that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nPersonnel involved in maintenance activities receive training on (1) overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\n\nAera Energy uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance, inspection, and construction activities. Because some of the contractors work on or near process equipment, Aera's facilities have procedures in place to ensure contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they may find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor and audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations through the internal safety and environmental auditing process.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nAera Energy conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of ammonia storage. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cogen facility's regulated substance is Anhydrous Ammonia, which is used to reduce air emission NOx in the turbine exhaust.  The Aera Cogen 32 Facility is located at Aera Energy's Belridge production field.  The Cogen facility produces electricity and steam from gas turbines and stores Anhydrous Ammonia for use in NOx reduction of Turbine exhaust. \n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nAmmonia\nThe EPA RMP Comp worst-case scenario (WCS) is a release of 51,667 lbs of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes, having a release endpoint of 4 miles. The EPA RMP Comp alternative release scenario (ARS) is a transfer hose failure with a release rate of 695 lbs per minute, for 30 minutes with a distance end point of 0.26 miles.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility, which is regulated by Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) Cal/OSHA's process safety management (PSM).
