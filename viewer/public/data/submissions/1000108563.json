This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of corn syrup, dry dextrose, industrial starch, and baking starches. We have one regulated substance at our facility, ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is used in starch modification. \n\nThe storage system for EO is designed to prevent overheating and contamination of EO. Specific measures for EO storage passive mitigation include a break tank and a sump in the secondary containment area. Specific measures for EO storage active mitigation include a one-million gallon disposal tank, a packed-column vapor scrubber, cooling of ethylene oxide transfer, process control and detection systems. Nitrogen continues to be utilized for the bulk storage tank, break tank, and railcar blanketing. There is also the capability to use nitrogen for maintenance purging.\n\nPASSIVE MITIGATION\nThe BREAK TANK creates a \"BREAK\" between the process and the bulk storage tank. Isolating the process from bulk storage will reduce the risk of contaminants getting into bulk storage. Contaminants could lead to unwanted reactions causing temperature rise, pressure rise, or increase in level.\n\nThe storage area incorporates a sloped diked area around railcar unloading and bulk storage, draining to a sump. The sump allows reclamation of any spilled material or deluge water.\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION\nThe one-million gallon DISPOSAL TANK allows emptying and dilution of the EO in the"

      "SummaryText": "bulk storage tank and the break tank. The tank is maintained at sufficient levels of water to allow dilution of the EO. There are also provisions to mix caustic with the EO to speed the conversion to ethylene glycol.\n\nVapor can be generated from maintenance activities requiring tank and/or pipe purging. Vapor can also result from venting of the bulk storage tank in the unlikely event that high pressures and high temperatures occur from contamination of the EO. The PACKED COLUMN vapor scrubber converts EO vapor into glycol liquid which can be safely handled in the facility pre-treatment plant.\n\nThe COOLING SYSTEM in the storage compound maintains the temperature in the storage tank at 50-55 F. The cooling system includes a cooling jacket on the bulk storage tank and a heat exchanger on the transfer system.\n\nPROCESS CONTROLS have been utilized in the past to ensure the continuous monitoring of EO. \nThe Ethylene Oxide storage system has many layers of safety to prevent a release of ethylene oxide from the storage tank and associated system. All control interlocks are designed to shut down the system and bring it to a safe state for inspection and troubleshooting. There are EO ambient sensors placed around the EO storage compound that are continuously monitored by the Central Control Room personnel. The EO storage tank has a mechanical excess flow valve on its discharge. The system also has an emergency air supply enabling system operation even in the event of a power outage.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate scenarios we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Off-Site Consequences analysis and EPA's RMPComp*.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 38 of the EPA.
