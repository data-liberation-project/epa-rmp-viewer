      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Durez Niagara facility was owned by Occidental Chemical Corporation until September 2000. At that time, Occidental sold its Durez Division to Sumitomo Bakelite who founded Durez Corporation. Durez Corporation owns and operates a phenolic resin manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, NY. The facility is located at 5000 Packard Road. The facility was originally constructed in 1928 and operated under the Varcum name. Reichold Chemical operated the facility to until 1984. BTL Industries operated the facility from 1984 to 1989, at which time it was sold to Occidental Chemical and became part of their Durez Division. The facility currently employs 66 employees.\n\n1. The Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (68.155[a]) \nDurez Corporation is committed to operating its Niagara Falls facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, industry standards and typical best management practices. As part of this commitment, Durez has established programs in place to help ensure safe operation of the phenolic resin processes at this facility including the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Niagara Falls facility and that complies with the requirements of the EPA's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). This document provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program at the Niagara Falls facility.\nThe Risk Management Program at the Niagara Falls facility consists of the following three elements:\n* A hazard assessment to help understand a) the potential of offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the"

The plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nDurez limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance, the material must be reviewed by the plant chemist, production/operations manager, and the environmental, health and safety leader(s) (EH&S). The review includes environmental, health and safety impacts, compatibility to materials of construction in the plant, and review of usage potential. If all managers approve the usage of the hazardous substance, the facility's management of change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures are followed to track it through the facility.\n\nDurez strives to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. Durez has and will continue to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. \nDurez:\n* Maintains a computer-based monitoring system on all of its phenolic resin reactors, which not only monitors all aspects of the process cycle such as raw material charging, reaction temperature, pressure, vacuum, condition of auxiliary equipment (pumps, valves, etc.), but when necessary, will automatically initiate active mitigation.  This can be closure of a valve, shutdown of a pump, or release of stored water to quench a reaction in a vessel."

The Stationary Source & Regulated Substances Handled (68.155[b])\nThe Niagara Falls plant handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantity to be covered by Part 68, and there is one RMP covered Program Level 3 process at the plant. This Level 3 process consists of the formalin storage tank (Tank 61), loading system, distribution lines (\"Formalin Loop\") to all 7 reactors on site, and those reactors.\nRegulated Substance: Formaldehyde Solution (45%)\nProcess: Resin Manufacturing\nMaximum Process Quantity, pounds *: 170,000\nRMP Threshold, pounds *: 15,000\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of formaldehyde.\nFormaldehyde is used as a raw material for phenol-formaldehyde resin. The specific hazards of formalin solution are listed in the SDS but may be summarized as follows:\n- a combustible liquid\n- irritating to the eyes, ears, nose and throat\n- IARC Class 2 carcinogen\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) & the Alternative Case Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls & Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (68.155[c])\nThe Niagara Falls plant performed offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis evaluated a \"worst case release scenario\" and an \"alternative case release scenario\". The plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. \nTrinity Consultants modeled the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case and alternative case scenarios.

The Trinity study results were checked against the 2019 version of RMPcomp available online, and the results were quite similar.\nIn both release scenarios, the heated formaldehyde solution rapidly cools upon release and contact with the concrete or asphalt ground surface. The liquid formaldehyde solution primarily crystallized to form paraformaldehyde solid, with some evaporation occurring to form a small vapor cloud.\n\nThe following information summarized the off site consequence analysis performed by the Niagara Falls plant:\n3.1 Toxic Substance(s) - Formaldehyde Solutions\nThe \"worst case release scenario\" for a 45% solution of formaldehyde is the release of the entire contents of a 30,000 gallon storage tank (92,708 pounds of formaldehyde in formalin solution). A concrete diked area contains the released formaldehyde solution while an estimated 50 pounds of formaldehyde gas vaporizes. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling in RMP*comp is 0.2 miles from the source.  The only environmental receptor located within this distance is a small, isolated wetland and a light industrial area.\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" for the formalin system is a failed gasket or weld at the pressurized formalin loop and the leaking of 51,800 pounds of formaldehyde in formalin solution to the asphalt or concrete surface below over a 15-minute period at 2,330 pounds per minute; mitigation would be turning off the formalin loop pump and absorbing or pumping the spilled solution up, completed in 60 minutes.
