If an accidental relase should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the relase to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia  is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The regulated pesticides are received, stored and distributed for direct application in pest control.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tank truck and stored in 2 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 6,108,170 pounds.\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount.  The tank would release 170,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.79 miles.  The alternatve release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a three inch line.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented the provision of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.: California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel S"

Continual evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia processes at the facility."
