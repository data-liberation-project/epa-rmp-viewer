              "Description": "The blending and shipping process blends, stores, and transfers hydrazine hydrate.  This process also transfers hydrazine, methylhydrazine, and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine.  This includes all process vessels, railcars, and containers.  Everything in this prevention program applies to the unit.  We have and continue to conduct PHA's and have incorporated the results into the process.  We comply with OSHA's PSM standard (Operating procedures, Management of Change, Mechnaical Integrity, etc...) which aids in the prevention of releases of these RMP substances.  Our primary prevention program is the employees who operate our process.  These individuals are well trained to operate the process in a manner that will not release hazardous substances into the environment.  ",

              "Description": "The manufacturing process for hydrazine includes all process vessels and containers starting from the raw materials to the finished product container.  All process vessels are included.  Everything in this prevention program applies to the unity.  We have conducted and continue to conduct PHA's and have incorporated the results into the process.  We comply with OSHA's PSM standard  (Operating Procedures, Management of Change, Mechanical, Integrity, etc...) through the RMP rule which aids in the prevention of releases of these RMP substances.  We have systems such as tank dikes, deluge systems, and sprinklers to aid in the mitigation of a release.  Our primary prevention program is the employees who operate our process.  These individuals are well trained to operate the process in a manner that will not release hazardous substances into the environment.  Production schedules vary in order to meet the needs of the customers.",

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles facility purifies hydrazine/water solution into pure hydrazine mainly for use in the aerospace industry.  This is done through a small purification process which is maintained using OSHA, EPA and LDEQ standards.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the purificaton process mentioned above, the facility also stores and packages hydrazine, MMH, and UDMH for government use in the space industry.  This product is stored in use railcars (for in-plant use only), cylinders, and drums.  The product and storage/package equipment is maintained by Arch for the Defense Logistics Agency - Energy (DLA-E) using applicable OSHA, EPA, and LDEQ standards.\n\n\n\nArch also imports 64% hydrazine for blending with water for packaging and sale of various concentrations of hydrazine from 15.5% to 64%.  The blending/shipping/storage equipment is maintained under the RMP standards."
