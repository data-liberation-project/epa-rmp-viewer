Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 15 states. Fifteen processing facilities produce about 56 million pounds of poultry products each week. Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 12 largest US grain companies. In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\n\n\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Gainesville Cook Plant is a poultry processing plant located south of Gainesville, Georgia at the junction of I-985 and Candler Road.  The facility is located in an industrial area with the closest residences to the northeast and to the north. The facility is a chicken cooking process plant which employs approximately 100 associates to receive chicken, Pork and turkey meat plus other raw ingredients to form, prepare and package for distribution to the market place. The facility normally operates 5 to 6 days per week with personnel present 24 hr a day, 7 days a week.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Gainesville facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717). The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in its cooling system. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia used in this process is approximately 23,780 pounds, distributed throughout various refrigeration components (compressor, pressure vessels, condensers, etc.). The majority of the refrigeration components are located on the roof, though piping is located throughout the facility.  The facility maintains a full-time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple service inspections on a daily basis. In addition, there is a compute"

All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices. Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans as part of an overall chemical management program. The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Regional Environmental Manager and the Regional Safety and Security Manager. Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health, and safety training to the its staff.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nThe Perdue Farms Gainesville facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components. As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance, as needed.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nPerdue's Gainesville Cook Plant facility has not had a serious accide"

The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials.

Perdue's officials have discussed the company's response program with our local LEPC and fire department representatives.\n\n\n\nAs part of our Risk Management Plan (RMP), Perdue Farms has developed an RMP Communications Plan. The goals of the plan are to:\n\n\n\n---Educate the public on the potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue\n\n\n\n---Respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communication\n\n\n\n---Be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental release scenario\n\n\n\nProactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, how the community should respond, and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared. In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civil groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Gainesville facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality.\n\n"
