We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n\n* Emergency Response Programs\n\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit that are regulated by EPAA's RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit located in Chambers County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Products Operating LLC and is operated by Enterprise.\n\nThe Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit is a processing facility designed to remove entrained gases from a stream of natural gasoline that has been treated in a process to oxidize any mercaptans in the stream to disulfides.  The gasoline stream is heated and sent to a stripping tower where heated gasoline vapors are used to strip the gases from the gasoline.   The degassed gasoline product is sent to pipeline storage facilities.  The gases exiting from the top of the stripping tower are refrigerated to condense most of the hydrocarbon vapors into a liquid product that is returned to the degassing process.  The stripped gases and remaining trace hydrocarbons are sent to a thermal oxidizer for combustion of nay non-condensed hydrocarbons.\n\n\n\nThe Plant is sub"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit include the gasoline stream containing a small amount of normal butane, plus significant amounts of normal pentane and isopentane.  Refrigerant grade propane is also used at the facility in the refrigeration system, but is present below the threshold quantity covered by the Risk Management Program regulation.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit and Storage.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit and Storage "

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nNatural Gasoline Degassing Unit has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.

The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for Natural Gasoline Degassing Unit is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu response organization (MAMB).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes response officials from local industries, the Mont Belvieu Police Department, the Mont Belvieu Fire Department, Emergency Medical Services and the Chambers County Emergency Management system (LEPC).
