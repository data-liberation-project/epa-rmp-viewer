      "SummaryText": "Cumberland Gap Provision is a Fully Cooked Meat Manufacturer for ham and sausages.  Our company has recently been purchased by Smithfield Foods.  In doing so, we have become a division of John Morrell & Co and will be compling with their Corporate Environmental Policies.  In February, our facility contracted an Engineering Group, Stark Engineering, to set up a more efficient PSM and RMP.  This particular engineering group has designed and developed Cumberland Gap Provisions ammonia refrigeration system from the very beginning.  The proposed date for their completion is June 16,2004.  During this time, they will be conducted meetings with plant management, maintenance, and any public meetings required.  They will also be providing training on the PSM.  The last HAZMAT training we conducted was in April of 1999.  Eight employees were trained, as well as, one local fire department.  We have plans to retrain some maintenance employees or just coordinate the emergency response with outside authorities due to the expense of training for HAZMAT.  All general emergency response training for the employees is planned in July.  We have not had any reportable releases in the last five years.  We have  coordinated emergency response with the LEPC, local fire department, and Regional EMS at National Guard."
