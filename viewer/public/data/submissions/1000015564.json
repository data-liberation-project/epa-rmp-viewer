This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Sulfur Dioxide Process.  Sun-Maid - RipperdanA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe facility utilizes sulfur dioxide for their system. At most, 7 One-Ton Cylinders are kept on-site for a total of 14,000 pounds.  During the downseason, major maintenance issues are handled to ensure the safe operation of the Sulfur Dioxide Process.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for the Sulfur Dioxide Process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the Sulfur Dioxide Process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Sun-Maid - Ripperdan has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g"

      "SummaryText": "., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of sulfur dioxide would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a sulfur dioxide release:\n- There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n- The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\nThe history of Sun-Maid - Ripperdan (i.e., no CalARP-applicable sulfur dioxide releases in the last five years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Sun-Maid - Ripperdan to manage process safety issues associated with the use of sulfur dioxide. Prevention Program 3 elements are listed in the table on the following page:\n \n\nCalARP (19 CCR)\nCompliance Workbook Tab\n2760.1    Process Safety Information (PSI) \n2760.2    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n2760.3    Operating Procedures (OP)\n2760.4    Training (TRN)\n2760.5    Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n2760.6    Management of Change (MOC)\n2760.7    Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n2760.8    Compliance Audits (CA)\n2760.9    Incident Investigation (II)\n2760.10 Employee Participation (EP)\n2760.11 Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n2760.12 Contractors (CON)\nArticle 7 Emergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of sulfur dioxide at the facility in at least the past five years.  \n \nEXTERNAL EVENTS ASSESSMENT \nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter "
