This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Sulfur Dioxide Process.  Sun-Maid - Ripperdan\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe facility utilizes sulfur dioxide for their system. At most, 7 One-Ton Cylinders are kept on-site for a total of 14,000 pounds.  During the downseason, major maintenance issues are handled to ensure the safe operation of the Sulfur Dioxide Process.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for the Sulfur Dioxide Process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the Sulfur Dioxide Process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Sun-Maid - Ripperdan has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g"
