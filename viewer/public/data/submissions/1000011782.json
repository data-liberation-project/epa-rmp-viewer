      "SummaryText": "POLICY STATEMENT- The Garniers Wastewater Treatment Facility is committed to being a responsible member of the community in which it operates by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Policy dictates that Garniers WWTF personnel continually identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the policy and compliance manuals, available to all employees.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED- The Okaloosa County Water and Sewer operates the Garniers WWTF located at 714 Essex Road in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. At the treatment plant, the facility stores approximately four (4) one-ton cylinders and a maximum of fifty (50) one hundred-fifty pound cylinders of chlorine. The one-ton cylinders are used on-site as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater. The one hundred-fifty pound cylinders are not used on-site, but are used at other facilities operated by the County. The one-ton cylinders and the one hundred-fifty pound cylinders are stored in separate areas at the facility.  ***In September 2009, the Garniers WWTF was taken out of service. As a result, the four (4) one-ton cylinders used for wastewater disinfection are no longer in service and have been removed from the site. However, the site continues to store up to a maximum of fifty (50), 150-pound chlorine cylinders.***\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS- The Garniers WWTF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68. The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule. A process hazard analysis was conducted at this facility using a \"what-if\" a"

Mitigation systems in use include neutralization and enclosure. Monitoring/detection systems include process area detectors and perimeter monitors. \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY- The Garniers WWTF has not had an accidental release in the last five (5) years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM- In the event a significant release occurs, the Okaloosa County Department of Emergency Services would be notified immediately to respond. The Department of Emergency Services would dispatch experienced personnel trained to handle such situations. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY- It was observed during the process hazard analysis that the Garniers WWTF has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination systems. There are no changes planned to improve safety at this time."
