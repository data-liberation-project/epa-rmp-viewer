Hydrofluoric Acid\nHeraeus Tenevo Inc.\n100 Heraeus Blvd. \nBuford, Georgia 30518\n\nBackground\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) \npromulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Heraeus Tenevo, Inc. submits this \nRisk Management Plan (RMP) for Hydrofluoric Acid storage operations at their Buford, Georgia facility.  Heraeus Tenevo has been in operation at this facility for 19 years, providing quality products to customers and approximately 100 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\nHeraeus Tenevo is committed to protecting the surrounding public, environment and health of its employees.  To ensure that Hydrofluoric Acid handling and storage processes are operating at its most safe capabilities the processes are continually monitored both quantitatively and qualitatively.  HF storage and handling process also have been designed with redundant safety features to limit human error, limit exposure to HF during production and abate emissions from respective operations.  In accordance with Heraeus Tenevo RMP program, the processes are qualitatively evaluated with a ?What IF? hazard analysis to determine potential exposures and respective controls to minimize probability for loss.\nIn the event of a disaster or release, Heraeus Tenevo has developed an Emergency Response Plan to respond to applicable situations, evacuation of the facility and contact procedures for emergency authorities. \n\nStationary Sources & Regulated Substances\nHeraeus Tenevo stores Hydrofluoric Acid at a 70% concentration.  This chemical is stored in a liquid state within a 6500 gallon tank unit.  The unit is not capable of storing the maximum volume due engineering and administrative controls that have been implemented by Heraeus Tenevo.  The acid is used to clean and etch quartz cylinders to ensure that a quality product is manufactured and customer specifi"

The process was evaluated using EPA assumptions within the RMP*Comp program.  The release is based on the possibility of the 6500 gallon bulk acid storage unit rupturing.  The release duration took place over a 10 minute period.   The release rate to air was calculated to 1.01 lbs/min.  The toxic endpoint concentration was determined to be 0.016mg/L and the resultant estimated toxic endpoint distance was 0.2 miles.\nHeraeus Tenevo has several engineering and administrative controls in place to prevent the release of HF emissions and acid to the environment.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe scenario was determined by evaluating all process hazard information that has been gathered throughout the company?s 19 year operating time period.  The RMP*Comp software was used to evaluated a release of 70% HF that was caused by the bulk acid tank being overfilled.  The scenario is unlikely to take place due to certain process safety controls that are in place.  The toxic endpoint was determined to be a concentration of .016mg/L at a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1miles. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nTo prevent the release and ensure process reliability of Hydrofluoric Acid storage and handling processes at Heraeus Tenevo, several protective measure have been implemented within the manufacturing operation.  Heraeus has implemented engineering controls such air emission abatement equipment, level alarms and interlocked shutoffs to prevent overfilling of all tanks processing HF, all HF tank storage units are equipped with double walled tanks and secondary containment with leak detection/alarm systems, and all HF piping is designed with double walls with leak detection systems.   \nHeraeus Tenevo also has several administrative initiatives that will aid in preventing the release of HF to the environment.

The process is continually monitored for potential maintenance issues, and equipment malfunctions through preventative maintenance programs and departmental inspections.  A process hazard analysis is also conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Program for Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nOver the last five years, Heraeus Tenevo has experienced not experienced a reportable accidental release of Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nHeraeus Tenevo has designed and implemented an Emergency Response program to ensure proper information and training is in place to prevent employee and community Hydrofluoric Acid exposures.  The program details what local and state government agencies to contact in the event of a spill and what position is responsible for such actions.  The program also details the responses that are necessary in the event of incipient and large fires, likely natural disasters and explosions.  \nHeraeus Tenevo employees do not respond significant to Hydrofluoric Acid releases.  The process is designed to contain all spills to prevent the migration of liquid and chemical exposures.  If a spill occurs, employees are trained to notify management and an outside contractor will proceed with the cleanup.  \nThe Heraeus Tenevo Buford, Ga. Plant is included in the community emergency response plan developed by the Georgia DNR-EPD and the LEPC for Gwinnett County.\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\nHeraeus Tenevo is committed to developing and nurturing a proactive and continual safety program.  These efforts include having a full-time safety professional onsite, providing consistent training on specific process hazards and continually evaluating the program and processes for deficiencies."
