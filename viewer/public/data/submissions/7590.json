      "SummaryText": "Background\n\nWater Treatment Plant (WTP) No. 4 is one of four plants owned and operated by the City of Maitland that contributes to the city's potable water supply.  Total population served is approximately 14,600.  In the process of developing raw water to a product that is suitable for domestic use, chlorine is used as a disinfectant against pathogens at each of these plants. The Clean Air Act section 112 ( r ), lists chlorine as a regulated toxic substance. Plants that store amounts of a regulated substance greater than their respective threshold listed in Table 1 of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.130, must comply with the provisions of 40 CFR part 68- the Risk Management Program (RMP). WTP No. 4 has a maximum inventory of 8,000-lbs of chlorine gas which surpasses the 2,500-lb threshold for chlorine.  For this reason, WTP No. 4 must meet the terms set forth in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nAs part of the RMP, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was conducted to determine the potential area effected by a worst-case and alternate release scenario and disclose the offsite public and environmental receptors affected by these scenarios.  WTP No. 4 has its chlorine storage area and equipment room enclosed within a concrete block building.  Any release at the plant is most likely to happen within the building thus lowering the release rate and the offsite impact. This passive mitigation was considered for the alternate release scenario. However, for the worst case release scenario an accident occurring outside the enclosure was modeled. A brief description of the scenarios and their results follows:\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Table 4-3 and considered a 1-ton chlorine cylinder releasing its full contents in ten minutes. This accident could result during the delivery of the chlorine to the plant.  It was determined that this scenario would have an impact on offsite public receptors located wit"

      "SummaryText": "hin a 3-mile radius from the plant.\n\nThe alternate release scenario considered a failed regulator with a 1/2 inch hole in the 5/8-inch polyethylene tubing used to connect the chlorinator to the PVC gas header.  Using the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Exhibit 4-15, the release rate for a 1/2-inch hole is 37-lb/min.  However, this scenario considers the enclosure of the chlorine storage area and an allowable 55% reduction in the release rate was utilized. This produced a final release rate of  20.35-lb/min and would have an impact on offsite public receptors located within a .15 mile radius. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn effort to discourage scenarios like the above from occurring, WTP No. 4 complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and has up-to-date technological equipment and strict procedural practices in place.\n\nThe plant uses cylinder-mounted regulators that operate entirely by vacuum to eliminate leaks or breaks associated with pressure-systems.  Warning devices such as a chlorine gas detector and residual analyzer are used to detect chlorine leaks. These two systems are interfaced with a control panel and a remote dialer system to alarm the appropriate personnel of the existing condition. Communication is enhanced by the use of two-way radios used by the city employees which are capable of contacting the police department in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlant procedural practices are safety oriented and include procedures for operating, inspecting, changing and maintaining chlorine process equipment. A training program is provided to familiarize city employees with the chlorine process and safety equipment.  Other programs are implemented to ensure information on chlorine and its hazards are available to the plant employees and contractors.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWTP No. 4 has no reportable accidental releases within the last 5-years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe City of Maitland Utilities will not be respond"
