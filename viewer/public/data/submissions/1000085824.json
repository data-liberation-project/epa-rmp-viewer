Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of AGRILAND FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Albany Community Fire Protection District, Gentry County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2004, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\r\n\r\n4. Five year accident history.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property"
