      "SummaryText": "The City of New Town Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program specified under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, herein referred to as the \"Rule\", in conjunction with the use of chlorine at the facility for water disinfection.  This update to the plan has been submitted to meet the anniversary date of November 2, 2021.  Preparation of this document will serve as revision one (1) to the RMP for Chlorine. \n\n\n\nThe New Town WTP is subject to the RMP Rule due to the storage of greater than 2,500 of gaseous chlorine onsite.  Under the RMP guidelines, the New Town WTP is a Program 2 Facility. As part of the development of this report New Town has completed a comprehensive review of the risk associated with the regulated process, water chlorination, at its facility.  Additionally, the Offsite Consequence Analysis has been updated, an Emergency Response Plan has been developed, and communications have been initiated with local authorities to form a cooperative response procedure for potential releases from the facility. The WTP's prevention program has been reviewed and updated to continue to focus on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards of the regulated chemical and processes.  Recent amendments to the original RMP Rule have been addressed in this Version 1 of the New Town WTP RMP.   \n\n \n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe New Town WTP is located on the southwest side of the City of New Town.  The 900 gpm plant was constructed in 2013. The facility, which is owned and operated by the City of New Town, has the capacity to treat up 1,800 gallons per minute (gpm).  The facility is a ground water plant using lime softening, recarbonation, fluoridation, stabilization, and chlorine/chloramine disinfection.  The WTP maintains an inventory of two (2) one (1) - ton cylinders of gaseous chlorine encased in individual ChlorTainer Total Containmen"

All chlorine distribution lines located outside of the chlorine room are low-pressure vacuum lines. If the vacuum is broken on any of the distribution lines the chlorinators will automatically shut down.  According to the Rule, any facility with greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine onsite is required to develop and implement am RMP.  Therefore, the New Town WTP chlorination system is a Risk Management-regulated process.\n\n\n\nTo minimize the potential for an accidental chlorine release the City of New Town has installed total containment systems for each of the one-ton cylinders stored on site.  The containment system is manufactured by TGO Technologies, Inc. and is referred to as a ChlorTainer. ChlorTainer is a total confinement system employing a self-contained vessel within which the ton cylinder is stored and chemical is fed, minimizing risk from a chlorine leak at the New Town WTP. \n\n\n\nClorTainers are stored in the chlorine room, which is located in the lower level of the plant in the southwest corner.  The room is equipped with a high volume ventilation system that starts when the room light is turned on. The New Town WTP operates the facility approximately 12 hours per day, seven (7) days per week depending on water demands. The chlorine room and its components are visually inspected at least once per day during operation.  The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.  In addition to the exhaust system, an observation window between the plant and the chlorine room allows the room to be visually checked before entering. A chlorine detector and alarm system are located outside of the room access door. \n\n\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Its boiling point is -29.4&#61616;F.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials.  Contact with evapor"

Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will travel along the ground and fill low spaces and pits by displacing air.  One-ton chlorine containers are welded steel tanks with removable steel protective caps over the container valves.  They are built to meet Federal specifications, and are regularly inspected and pressure tested in accordance with Federal regulations. \n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nThe owner or operator of a stationary source is required to develop and implement a Management System to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.  This provision requires a clear delineation of the lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility for the overall Risk Management Program.    \n\n\n\nThe New Town Water Department Foreman will have overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this procedure.  The purpose of the Management System is to ensure that all parties participating in the RMP understand their respective roles and responsibilities, and that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nThe New Town WTP has examined their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite.  The results of this analysis are presented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (Section 2.0 Hazard Assessment section of the RMP), which is composed of a Worst Case and Alternative (most likely) Scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Analysis\n\n\n\nAlthough the US EPA acknowledges that the Worst Case Scenario is not a likely scenario, the New Town WTP has formulated a scenario to alert the public to the worst possible release.  The Worst Case Scenario for this facility involves the release of 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine (the entire contents of one (1) container), directly into the atmosphere, over a 10-minute period.  The facility is located on the southwest edge of the City of New Town.   There are residential subdivisions north and ea"

The radius of influence represents the distance the chlorine plume would travel from the facility, under assumed meteorological conditions, before the concentration is reduced below the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2) level, the \"toxic endpoint\".  The US EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance states the ERPG-2 concentration \"is that below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  A population of 2,240, or 100 percent of the population of the City of New Town, resides within this radius.  The US EPA requires that the radius of influence is calculated considering a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, or 3.4 miles per hour.  Historically, average wind speed in the vicinity New Town ranges 10.9 to 11.7 miles per hour out of the southwest; thus, a release would likely disperse at a faster rate than estimated under the RMP assumed conditions.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Analysis\n\n\n\nThe New Town WTP has also formulated an alternative, or most likely, scenario as part of its RMP.  This scenario involves a release occurring inside the chlorine room.  The New Town WTP utilizes a vacuum-operated chlorination system minimizing risk of chlorine releases in the plant.  A pressure regulating valve is installed directly onto the ChlorTainer, between the container and the chlorinator.  For this valve to open, a vacuum must be present on the chlorinator side of the valve.  The vacuum is created by water passing through the ejector on the chlorinator.  When a vacuum is present and the valve is open, gaseous chlorine may be drawn from the container, through the valve, into the chlorinator, and then injected into the water."

      "SummaryText": "  In the absence of a vacuum on the chlorinator side of the valve, the valve closes and chlorine cannot escape through the valve on the container.  In the event of equipment failure on the ChlorTainer side of the valve, the valve is designed to contain the release.\n\n\n\nBecause the regulating valve is attached directly to the ChlorTainer vessel, the most likely potential route for escape of chlorine gas from the container is between the valve stem of the container and the pressure-regulating valve.  The New Town WTP has also formulated an alternative, or most likely, scenario as part of its RMP.  This scenario involves a release occurring inside the chlorine room. The alternative scenario modeled for this facility involves a leak from the lead gasket between the regulating valve and the chlorine container after the cylinder has been placed in the ChlorTainer.  Each time a new cylinder is connected to the system, a new lead gasket is installed prior to being placed in the ChlorTainer.  Although the gasket is checked for leaks immediately after installation, the alternative scenario assumes a small leak is not detected prior to sealing the Chlortainer vessel. The leak continues throughout the night and the entire contents of the vessel are released over a period of 855 minutes (14? hours).  Because the vessel is inside a Chlortainer within the enclosed chlorine storage area, the room and Chlortainer act as a passive mitigation measures to contain the release.  A conservative radius of influence for this release is 0.2-mile with approximately 12 households with approximately 33 people located within this radius.  In recognition of this potential release, the New Town WTP integrate RMP training with other routine training topics.  Increased employee awareness of the consequences of even a small release is expected to further reduce the likelihood of such a scenario occurring. \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe New Town WTP has not had any incidents involving chlorine that result"

This procedure will also be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect changes in responsibilities at the facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nAlthough the potential for a release exists, the New Town WTP has determined that the chlorination system is safe by industry standards and that the potential for a release from the facility is very small.  The facility works with the Mountrail County LEPC and the Municipal Fire Department to prepare emergency responders in the event of a major release.  The New Town WTP employees do not respond to releases other than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The New Town WTP relies on the Mountrail County LEPC and Sheriff's Department to manage response procedures in the event of a major chlorine release at the facility.  The WTP's Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed frequently with local responders. Results of the offsite consequence analysis developed for this RMP have been communicated to the LEPC, which shares information with the Fire Departments and Sheriff's Office.  \n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP Amendments, the New Town WTP will continue to coordinate with local emergency responders at least once annually.
