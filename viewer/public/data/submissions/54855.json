Our trained Tactical Response Team works closely with area hospitals and other response organizations in the surrounding community.\n\nAs noted, the facility has contracted with the Louisiana State University Firemen Training Academy to train the Tactical Response Team in Hazardous Materials Emergency Response, Industrial Fire Fighting, and in aiding the site to perform emergency drills organized and directed by the SABIC Emergency Response Teams. In addition, the site conducts quarterly drills involving our chemicals and invites the community emergency response agencies to participate. These drills are designed to test our operations, our Response Team members, and the community response agencies in the proper response to such an event.\n\nOngoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident.\n\nSABIC personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for local communities. In addition, they are members of local emergency planning and emergency preparedness groups, and are active members of the surrounding volunteer fire departments.\n\n0.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSABIC is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Burkville facility. Some of the specific planned changes aimed at improving safety are:\n\n-Continuing development of best management practices under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program; and\n\n-Implementing advanced training for operators to further reduce the chance of human error leading to a workplace injury or an accidental release."

We operate in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management rule, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily process safety control methods and behaviors.\n\nThese guidelines have been adopted to satisfy, in part, the stated policy of SABIC to safely manage our site operations and to take care of the people who work here and the community around us. We recognize that any less commitment would weaken our ability to provide jobs for our employees and to be a part of the economy of Central Alabama.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan is a continuation of that effort. It shows solid integration of our plant emergency response resources and communication channels with those of the community. \n\nOur intensive ongoing internal reviews and OSHA's external audit process continue to validate the strengths of the programs we have in place. We have been certified by OSHA under its Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) as a STAR site, the highest certification OSHA gives. We believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility. If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plant, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (334) 832-5650.\n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSABIC is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our environment, our neighbors and our employees is the highest priority. This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\n\nThe Burkville facility us"

While we are committed to 100% compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain safe operation with these materials, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements. Our operating practices and procedures provide for numerous controls that are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\n\nIn the event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical and chemical emergency response teams staffed with SABIC employees who have trained collectively for thousands of hours. Many of these employees serve in their community fire and emergency response organizations, devoting much of their personal time to additional drills, training and community response.\n\nThe Burkville facility has contracted the Alabama Fire College to provide the Emergency Response training for our Tactical Response Team (TRT) members. Alabama Fire College instructors have conducted training for our facility in all areas of chemical emergencies, industrial fire fighting and emergency management. A review of our emergency response program was made as part of the OSHA VPP STAR review in 2008 and was found to fully meet all the OSHA emergency response requirements.\n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Burkville plant is located about 15 miles west of Montgomery, AL. The 288 members of the Burkville Team manufacture engineered plastics, marketed under the trademarked name LEXAN(R). Our products are used in industries such as automotive, electronics, computer, and compact disc, and also in large appliances.\n\nWorkplace safety and environmental protection are part of the SABIC culture and record. Of the initial $325 million investment in the plant, nearly 25% went to safety and envi"

SABIC has now invested some $1 billion in the plant for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection.\n\nDemonstration of this safety and environmental commitment is reflected not only in the VPP Star designation but also in many examples including: 1.) reduction of emissions by 60% while increasing production by more than five-fold; and, 2.) Twenty-two years of operating without exceeding the plant's wastewater discharge permits (twice the plant has received the Award of Excellence for industrial wastewater treatment in Alabama).\n\nCompleted in 1987, the plant occupies about 300 acres of a 6,300-acre site along the Alabama River. Under SABIC\u00bfs stewardship, this large Alabama site has been certified as a National Wildlife Habitat. The Wildlife and Land Management Committee, an employee volunteer group, pursues programs, including reforestation, pond management and bluebird trails.\n\nThe Burkville plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. These are chlorine and phosgene, and both are on the RMP list of regulated toxic substances. Chlorine and phosgene are raw materials used to manufacture our products.\n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSABIC has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). PSM is an integral part of working safely at SABIC facilities. PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the RMP rule. Some of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\n-Computer-controlled safety systems on the phosgene and chlorine manufacturing processes to ensure"
