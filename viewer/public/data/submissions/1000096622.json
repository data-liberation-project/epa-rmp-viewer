Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nLincoln Parish Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Lincoln Parish Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lincoln Parish Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Energy Transfer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Energy Transfer employees are trained to respond to releases in a \"limited\" manner meaning at no time will an employee assume an unreasonable risk to deal with an emergency. Only when safe to do so, trained employees may secure the area; identify the problem; conduct a hazard and risk assessment; perform system shutdowns, isolation and pressure reduction, as deemed necessary; contain and mitigate incidental releases, etc. If an unreasonable risk exists, employees will evacuate from the danger zone and will contact trained emergency responders and 3rd party contractors to assist in controlling and mitigating emergency situations. During such emergencies, employees will assist in an indirect manner and will not assume active response measures within the danger zone. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe  Energy Transfer's Lincoln Parish Gas Plant is a 200 MMscf/d cryogenic processing plant that processes the natural gas received and then sends the Residue Natural Gas to customers via the Residue Pipeline and the Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) to customers via the NGL Pipeline. The facility processes the gas to drop the temperature of the gas to remove condensed Ethane and other Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which reduces the British Thermal Unit (BTU) level of the gas flowing from the well to approximately 1,100 BTU which is a suitable level for use as natural gas."

      "SummaryText": "To achieve these results the natural gas is received via an Inlet Separator that allows the liquid to drop out of the Gas.  The Gas then enters the two (2) Inlet Gas Compressors (each rated for 102.5 MMscf/d).\r\n\r\nFrom the Inlet Compressors the compressed gas enters the Amine Unit, as necessary.  The Gas is contacted with the Amine, which removes impurities (CO2) from the gas.  The CO2 (acid gas) flows out with the Amine and is typically routed to an RTO to destroy entrained VOC's. The gas flows to the Mol Sieve Dehydrators, which removes moisture from the gas before the gas enters the Chilling and Expansion Section.  The heat exchange that takes place in this section allows the heavier hydrocarbons to condense in the Demethanizer and supply the NGL System and Pipeline.  The lighter hydrocarbons go out the top of the Demethanizer and supply the Residue Gas Compressor. The Residue Compressors increase the Residue Gas Pressure.  This increase in pressure is necessary so that the Residue Gas can enter the Residue Gas Pipeline.  The NGLs from the Demethanizer enter the NGL Product System where Pipeline Pumps provide the pressure necessary for the NGLs to enter the NGL Pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains three sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; Methane, Condensate (Pentane), and NGLs (Flammable Mixture). \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nProcesses at the Lincoln Parish Gas Plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 3 (RMP) regulation.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Lincoln Parish Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per Energy Transfer Risk Management Protocol.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Lincoln Parish Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the Plant, or at minimum every fi"

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Lincoln Parish Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Energy Transfer has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field"

Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
