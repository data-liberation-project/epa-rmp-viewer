An\r\nalternative release scenario represents a release that: 1)  might\r\noccur  at a facility such as CFS, and/or, 2) would result in  the\r\ngreatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis\r\nis to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur\r\nto  the  public  because  of an accidental  release  (called  the\r\nendpoint  distance).  Minimal effects could occur at the endpoint\r\ndistance.   At  distances  less than the endpoint  distance,  the\r\neffects  would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint\r\ndistance, the effect would be less.\r\n\r\nThe  RMP  rule includes specific requirements for the  worst-case\r\nand  alternative release scenarios that must be reported by  CFS.\r\nThese requirements are:\r\n\r\n          One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for\r\n          the   class  of  flammable  substances  in  Program   3\r\n          processes.\r\n\r\nThe  following  information summarizes  the  offsite  consequence\r\nanalysis performed by CFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Issue Date:\r\n   12/31/98\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Processes\r\n     Flammable Substances:\r\n\r\nThe  worst-case  release  scenario for  flammable  substances  is\r\nfailure of the 59,775 gallon gasoline storage tank, resulting  in\r\na  vapor  cloud explosion.  No administrative controls or passive\r\nmitigation  were  considered  for  this  release  scenario.   The\r\nmaximum  distance  to  the 1-psi overpressure  endpoint  is  0.56\r\nmiles.    Several  public  receptors  are  located  within   this\r\ndistance,  including Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Lakin  Golf\r\nCourse Clubhouse and some residences east of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe  alternative release scenario for flammable substances  is  a\r\npipe  rupture of the line from the product storage vessel to  the\r\nproduct pumps"
