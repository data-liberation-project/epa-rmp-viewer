(IMCC) Westend Facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and health.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the manufacturing processes at our facilities.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  These goals are achieved through strong leadership, teamwork, effective communications and by striving to continuously improve in all areas of our business.\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy that provides that:\n\n1) All facilities will be designed, operated and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public;\n2) All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and  safety standards and procedures;\n3) Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals;\n4) Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and/or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases. \n\nIMCC is proud to be an active participant in the Chemical Manufacturers Association - Responsible Care program.  As a member of CMA, this company is committed to support a continuing effort to improve the industry's responsible management of chemicals.  IMCC pledges to manage their business according to the principles of Responsible Care.\n\n2.  Stationary Source(s) and Regulated Substance(s) Handled"

      "SummaryText": "Anhydrous ammonia is used at the plant as a refrigerant to chill the brine, causing borax and sulfate crystallization, and as a coolant for the gas-turbine-generator inlet.  Liquid and/or gaseous anhydrous ammonia is present in the vessels and associated piping found throughout the various cooling processes within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a single aboveground pressurized storage vessel.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance that exceeds the threshold planning quantity in this process. \n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe worst case release scenario is loss of the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia storage vessel as a gas in a 10 minute period.  No liquid pooling was considered to occur during the release of anhydrous ammonia that is liquefied in the storage vessel by pressure.  Administrative controls limit the storage of anhydrous ammonia in the vessel to 85% of the vessel's capacity.  Calculations for this scenario were developed using a commercial plume dispersion model, BREEZE DEGADIS+, version 3.0.1. The results from this model show the distance to the toxic endpoint of  0.14 mg/L has offsite impacts.  However, this worst case release scenario is considered unlikely to occur based on the material properties of the liquefied anhydrous ammonia and the design of the pressurized storage vessel.\n\nThe alternative release case for anhydrous ammonia giving the furthest distance to the toxic endpoint involves a release through the first four feet of a three-inch line to the ammonia storage vessel that does not contain shut-off valves.  Using standard alternative release scenario parameters, EPA software, RMP*COMP, was used to determine the distance to the 0.14 mg/L toxic endpoint.  The results obtained from this software showed that the distance to the toxic endpoint would have offsite impacts.\n\n4.

Maintenance personnel are hired as trained and qualified maintenance journeyman.  \n\nIMCC carries out and documents maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure reliable and safe operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks include:  storage tanks, piping and valves, relief systems, electrical systems, instrumentation systems, mobile equipment, detection and monitoring systems.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks or operations personnel are corrected in a timely manner and tracked through a computer-based system. The computer system also notifies maintenance personnel of preventive maintenance tasks.\n\nIMCC conducts periodic audits to determine whether provisions set out under the PSM standard are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are promptly addressed.  \n\nIMCC promptly investigates all accidents/incidents that result in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The IMCC accident/incident policy and procedure were established to provide guidance in identifying and documenting the situation(s) leading to the accident/incident as well as any corrective actions necessary to prevent reoccurrence.  All records and reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nIMCC believes that process safety  management and accident/incident prevention are a team effort. Employee and management participation in all areas of EHS are encouraged and well publicized in our policies and procedures, training, and meeting requirements. \n\nAir monitoring systems have been strategically located in the Westend Facility for ammonia. These air monitors help warn employees of a leak.  Such a warning allows quick response by the area operator(s) and the HAZWOPER Team should they be needed.  Additionally, all areas of the various plants have IMCC employees working on a 24-hour per day basis.  This employee presence allow"

The IMCC covered processes were designed, constructed and are maintained according to nationally recognized industry codes and standards and regulatory requirements.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards.  Based on the quantity of this material at IMCC, IMCC is subject to PSM requirements and thus satisfies the eligibility requirements for a program 3 prevention program under EPA's RMP.  IMCC Facilities have fully implemented Cal-OSHA's PSM standard requirements and are using this program as its RMP Prevention Program.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the PSM program that are in place at our facilities:\n\nIMCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with each covered process.\n\nIMCC maintains written operating procedures, which are periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  Additionally, all facilities have written ISO documents that support Operations' personnel in their efforts to conduct all activities in a safe and responsible manner.  Most maintenance procedures are in the form of JSA's and written ISO documents that pertain to very specific tasks.  These aid our maintenance personnel in their efforts to conduct all activities in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIMCC has a comprehensive training program to ensure that all employees who operate processes, are trained and competent in the operating procedures associated with each process.

Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Westend Facility and placed into the receiving tank by a vendor following a specified procedure, under controlled conditions and under the supervision of an IMCC employee.  Should a release occur, trained emergency response personnel would respond to the release.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities in covered processes that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  Since June 21, 1994, Westend Facility has had one incident that meets the on-site reporting criteria but no incidents that have had off-site impacts.  An on-site release occurred in March, 1996, when anhydrous ammonia leaked from the ammonia system.  An IMCC employee was taken to the emergency room for treatment due to ammonia inhalation and was then released to return to work. \n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nIMCC has two very extensive and detailed written emergency response plans.  Both plans include all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuation notification of LERC/LEPD and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is periodically inspected and serviced and the emergency evacuation sirens are tested every Friday at noon.

IMCC coordinates their EHS efforts with several State and County agencies including the San Bernardino County Fire Agency and Sheriff offices.  Mutual responses efforts have been established with the local San Bernardino County (volunteer) Fire Agency that provides additional emergency response expertise to both the community and IMCC facilities.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIMCC plans to hold an emergency response drill that will involve a simulated large chemical release.  At this time, local San Bernardino County agencies will be involved in the drill, including the Sheriff's Department, local SBC Fire Department, the local school system and selected members of the community.  Of course, the monthly employee safety meeting provided the opportunity for each person to make recommendations on ways to improve EHS within all of our facilities."
