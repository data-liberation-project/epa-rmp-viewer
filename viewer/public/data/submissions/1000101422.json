A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in The alternative release scenario(s) section below.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nA credible worst-case scenario, formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance, was selected as the Eddy Packing Company alternative release scenario. This scenario involves a one-inch diameter hole from a break in the high pressure liquid ammonia piping on the roof of the facility.   Results of this credible worst-case event indicate that there are some offsite receptors that would be affected.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nEddy Packing Company is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Maintenance Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program and also has clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, Eddy Packing Company maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.

At Eddy Packing Company the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nEddy Packing Company is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \r\n\r\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection via the Yoakum Fire Department.

Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected. \r\n\r\nThis type of release is not considered credible from the standpoint that an event of this nature would require the catastrophic failure of the container, resulting in a sudden release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.
