It is the policy of Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC to operate its facility in a maner that will minimize the risk of any accidental release.  While not all accidents are preventable, it is the policy of Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC to take all appropriate steps to minimize the possibility and impact of such accidents and releases.  These steps include the proper training of our operators, development of safety programs and operating procedures and frequent review and refresher training. \n \nSince Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC recognizes that there are accidents that may occur regardless of the amount of training, planning and program development it is also the policy of Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC to be prepared for any possible contingency.  Toward this end Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC has developed an emergency response plan.  The local emergency response first response agency as well as the Local Emergency Planning Committee has been involved in ongoing discussion and coordination of this emergency response plan.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe primary regulated process at the Maryland Virginia, Laurel LLC is an ammonia refrigeration system.  This systems primary function is to provide refrigeration to preserve milk and dairy products.  The refrigerated areas include walk in coolers, freezers and milk and finished product tanks.  The system consists of three screw compressors and three reciprocating compressors, three evaporative condensers, four air coil evaporators and numerous milk and finished product tanks.  The total system charge is 11,065 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nAdditional regulated substances include Chlorine, Nitric Acid and Su"

As part of this assessment one worst case and one alternate case release scenario was completed.  RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint for each of these scenarios. The impact of this release scenario was assessed using a plot of the resulting distance, developed using Marplot, Landview 6 and the 2000 Census data.\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Scenario Description\n\nOne worst case release scenario was developed based on a release of 6180 pounds of ammonia from the high pressure receiver.  This represents the maximum planned contents of the largest receiver as specified in 40 CFR 68.25(b)(1).  The scenario was calculated using RMP-Comp and was based on the entire contents being released as a vapor over a ten-minute period resulting in a release rate of 618 pounds per minute.  No mitigating measures were included in the calculation.  Additional criteria for the calculation were: \nTopography: Rural surroundings (terrain generally flat and unobstructed)\nToxic Endpoint: 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers)\n\nThe following assumptions were made in calculating this scenario:\nWind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour)\nStability Class: F\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C) \nIt was determined that a release of this nature under these conditions would affect approximately 2355 housing units and a total population of 7,220 people.\n\n\n3.2    Alternative Release Scenario Description\n\nOne alternate case release scenario, as described and specified in 40 CFR 68.28, was developed.  The rational of this scenario would be either damage caused by someone attempting to steal ammonia and drilling a high pressure line or damage to a charging hose during charging.  The quantity "

These include Lock-Out / Tag Out, Permit Entry Confined Space Entry, Emergency Response, and others.  Standard Operating Procedures have been developed to establish uniformity and safety in the day to day operations of the refrigeration system. Additionally, Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC has developed and implemented a comprehensive training program to insure the knowledge and skill levels of its employees and operators is developed and maintained at a high level of proficiency.  The key element and foundation of the Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC safety and training programs is the Maryland & Virginia Milk, Laurel LLC's Risk Management and Prevention Program.\n\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five year period preceding this report there ha"

Emergencies are not completely preventable so this plan defines the framework for an effective emergency response. The framework addresses such issues as training, preparation, assignment of authority, and risk assessment. It gives employees procedures to follow for effective and safe actions during an emergency, including evacuation.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Howard County Fire Department and the Howard County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all effected neighbors.\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation is accomplished."
