The Program was then completely changed to a new format in 2012/2013. \r\n\r\nAll elements have been updated. California Dairies, Inc. prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations.

California Dairies interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury\r\nabove and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be\r\nmonitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop or correct\r\nprocedures that may prevent future incidents.\r\n\r\nAny release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending\r\non the location of the release.

Ammonia is used as the\r\nrefrigerant in the Processing Plant Refrigeration System. The total ammonia inventory in the Processing Plant system\r\nexceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is a combination of a direct, closed loop, and secondary coolant mechanical refrigeration system. The original process was built in 1981. The ammonia equipment is located outside, in a\r\nmachinery room and in a cooler/freezer.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel\r\nor pipe. As this system has interconnected piping and since the largest vessel can hold the complete charge\r\nthe total system charge was used for the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this\r\nscenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the\r\nProcessing Plant System is separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will\r\ndecrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide\r\nuniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nCalifornia Dairies Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM (CalARP) Manual. The RMP Prevention\r\nProgram is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program\r\nimplemented by California Dairies is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\nKey objectives of California Dairies Preven"
