The District provides treated drinking water to approximately 6800\ntaps for customers in a service area of approximately 130 square miles in portions of\nunincorporated  Boulder and Weld counties in Colorado.\n     Surface water from Left Hand Creek is treated at the Spurgeon Plant.  During the months\nof November through March the Dodd plant is taken out of service when the Boulder feeder canal\nis de-watered for the winter.   During this winter period, the Districts water demands are met\nentirely from water treated at the Spurgeon plant.\n     Chlorine is added to the water at the plant as a disinfectant and to oxidize iron and\nmanganese for removal from the water during the filtration process.  \n     Chlorine gas is delivered to the plant and placed in the chlorine storage and containment\nbuilding in 2000 pound containers.  This building is designed to contain any chlorine gas in the event of\na  container or pipe leak.  An R. J. Environmental Chlorine Vapor Scrubber System is in place\nto prevent chlorine gas emissions from being exhausted to the atmosphere.  Chlorine gas detectors\nconstantly test the air in the room for any chlorine gas.  If chlorine gas is detected, an alarm is\nactivated and the scrubber is automatically started.  The scrubber pulls air from the room and\nremoves any chlorine from it before exhausting it to the atmosphere.  An alarm sounds in the plant\ncontrol room and also sends out pages to all plant operators for immediate response.\n     The Spurgeon Water Treatment Plant has never had a reportable release of chlorine gas. \nThis is due in a large part to the priority that the District places on safety.  All of our plant\npersonnel have received training and have been tested in their knowledge of safe chlorine handling\nand emergency respon"
