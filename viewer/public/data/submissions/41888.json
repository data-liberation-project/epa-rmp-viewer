The liquids flow through a series of tanks, static mixers and high-pressure pumps towards the pour table. At the pour table, parts \u00bfA\u00bf and \u00bfB\u00bf are combined together and injected between the top and bottom facers. RMAX uses several different types of facers, depending upon the type of foam board being produced. Once parts \u00bfA\u00bf and \u00bfB\u00bf are combined the liquids exothermically react to form solid foam. \nN-Pentane (CAS No: 109-66-0), which may be present in combination with Isopentane as an integral component of the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent used by RMAX, is a substance regulated by 40 CFR 68 [EPA\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions]. Taking into account \u00a7 68.115(b)(2)(i), RMAX has determined the total quantity of N-Pentane in its foam board manufacturing process (for purposes of a threshold quantity determination) to be the total amount of the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent (N-Pentane/Cyclopentane/Isopentane Blend) present in its process at any one time. The maximum amount present in RMAX?\u00bfs foam board manufacturing process at any one time is approximately 66,470 pounds. This is above the threshold quantity for N-Pentane of 10,000 pounds, as established in \u00a7 68.130. Therefore, RMAX has determined that the Dallas facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68 for N-Pentane. \n\nRMAX has defined its covered process as that equipment which contains or contacts the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent starting at the bulk storage tank loading (or fill) connection and extending up to and including the mix heads (located at the Pour Table). This determination was made based on the fact that once the Blowing Agent is mixed with the other foam components; it is no longer a liquid and is part of a solid, non-flammable product.).

      "SummaryText": "um threat distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure using RMPComp is 0.3 miles for a release quantity of 66,470 pounds of Blowing Agent. However, ALOHA predicted a total maximum threat zone of 1.0 mile. The more conservative ALOHA distance was used to evaluate potential impact. Using RMAX\u00bfs Latitude/Longitude as a center point, it is estimated that the maximum residential population within 1.0 mile of RMAX is 1209 persons. Based on visual reconnaissance, the population density within the affected area will be toward the northeast edge. The remainder of the affected area is occupied by industrial and commercial properties with no residences. This assumes a uniform population density throughout the block group\u00bfs land area within the specified radius. Through a review of local street maps and by visual observations of the area surrounding its facility, RMAX has identified several types of public receptors within the distance to the endpoint from a worst case release. These types of receptors include: commercial, industrial, and retail facilities. RMAX has determined, through examination of the Addison USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle Map, that there are no environmental receptors located within the 1.0 mile distance to the Level 3 (Yellow LOC) end point from a worst case release from its facility. \n\nModeling of the worst case release scenario was conducted using the EPA Program ALOHA v. 5.3.1. The output of the ALOHA model is summarized at the end of Section 3.0. Meteorological data used for the modeling was taken from available information of the National Weather Service for the DFW area, and manually input into the program. The Worst Case Release Scenario Plot Plan for the RMAX Dallas facility (Figure 1) is at the end of Section 3.0.

This is above the applicability quantity for a flammable liquid of 10,000 pounds, as established in \u00a7 1910.119(a)(1)(ii). Thus, RMAX has determined its Dallas, Texas facility is subject to the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThrough preparation of this Risk Management Program / Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM), RMAX has determined that its Dallas Operations is a Program 3 process as defined by 40 CFR 68.10(d). This determination is based on the results of the worst-case release scenario for N-Pentane (the location of public receptors being within the distance to the endpoint) presented in Section 3.0, and the applicability of 29 CFR 1910.119 to its facility. Thus RMAX has complied with the requirements for preparation and submittal of a Program 3 RMP as contained in 40 CFR 68.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nIn order to calculate the distance to the endpoint from a worst case release of Blowing Agent (N-Pentane/Cyclopentane/Isopentane Blend), the EPA automated program RMPComp v. 1.07 was used to perform the off site consequence analysis. The program provided a conservative estimate for the distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure. The quantity of N-Pentane used in the worst case release scenario analysis for RMAX\u00bfs Dallas, Texas facility has been determined to be the amount of Blowing Agent contained in the facility\u00bfs on-site bulk storage tank. In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(e), for purposes of calculating the distance to the worst case release endpoint, RMAX has assumed that the entire contents of the single largest vessel containing Blowing Agent (66,470 pounds) is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, and that 10% of the released quantity participates in the resulting explosion. \n\nRMAX has determined the maxim"

These possibilities are:\n\n1.Transfer Hose Release of Blowing Agent (During tanker truck unloading); and\n2.Process Piping Release of Blowing Agent (Shear of piping within the building by forklift).\n\nA Transfer Hose Release of Blowing Agent (occurring during truck unloading) is referred to as Alternative Release Scenario # 1 while a Process Piping Release of Blowing Agent (occurring inside of the manufacturing building) is referred to as Alternative Release Scenario # 2. RMAX has determined, based on the physical properties of the Blowing Agent, a release from either a transfer hose or from process piping would result in the release/spill of a flammable liquid. The evaporation rate and boiling point of the Blowing Agent are such that any spill would probably result in the formation of a pool of flammable liquid. Thus, in evaluating the consequences of a Transfer Hose Release and a Process Piping Release, RMAX has chosen to evaluate the potential radiant heat effects of a pool fire for each type of release.\n\nIn order to determine the effects of each Alternative Release Scenario, the following methodology has been used:\n\n(1)Determination of a release quantity and duration of Blowing Agent for each Alternative Release Scenario (Described in Sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n\n(2)Calculation of the maximum area of the pool of spilled Blowing Agent (at a depth of one centimeter) for each Alternative Release Scenario.

These types of receptors include commercial and industrial facilities.
