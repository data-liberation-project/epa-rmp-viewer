This process was reviewed using Process Hazard Analysis.  The process was also tested in the lab prior to testing in the plant reactor.   \n\n\n\nThe goal of the process hazard analysis (PHA) was to identify process hazards that could lead to consequences of interest and recommend ways for reducing the likelihood of undesirable events associated with those identified hazards. The PHA covered all equipment associated with the Triazine process. The analysis included evaluating routine and nonroutine phases of operation (including startup, shutdown, and maintenance) for potential equipment failures, human errors, and process problems that could result in consequences of interest.\n\n\n\nA multidisciplinary team was assembled to perform the analysis, including facility operations and engineering.  Process information was provided by the customers subject matter expert.   \n\n"
