      "SummaryText": "Introduction and General Information\nDanisco USA, Inc. (Danisco) owns and operates a hydrogenation facility located three miles north of Thomson, IL. It produces hydrogenated sugars (Xylitol and Lactitol) for commercial and industrial uses. The facility stores one chemical in excess of the threshold quantities listed in the US EPA Accidental Release Protection Regulations in the Clean Air Act Section 112\u00ae (RMP). The facility is located at latitude 42.002500 and longitude -090.110833, in a rural setting in Carroll County, Illinois. The terrain in the local vicinity is flat to gently rolling land surface in a rural agricultural setting. The Mississippi River is located approximately one mile west of the facility, and the land use in that direction is agricultural. To the east, the land use is also agricultural, and the land to the south immediately abutting the facility is also agricultural, but approximately three miles south of the facility is the village of Thomson, IL. The land to the north of the facility is also agricultural lands, and the city of Savanna, IL is approximately seven miles north.\nAccording to the 1992 data for the Quad Cities Airport in Moline, IL, (nearest data source), the prevailing wind in the vicinity comes out of the south to northwest (approximately 180o to 330o). The average wind speed is 7.21 Knots (8.29 miles per hour). The stronger winds come out of 300o to 330o with velocities of as much as 17 to 21 Knots, and on limited occasions (<1%) the wind velocities exceed 21 Knots. The quadrant from 180o to 270o provides the majority of the winds. They are less intense (11 to 16 Knots maximum) but represent approximately 35% of the windy days. Winds are calm approximately 12.3% of the time. This data is based on 24 hours a day, 365 days per year for the year 1992. In computing and modeling the worst case scenarios the atmospheric stability class was set to F and the wind speed was set at 1.5 meters per second in accordance with the US EPA gui"

This was necessary due to the lack of the most recent three-year meteorological data.\n\nAccident History\nDanisco operates a modern facility with state of the art safety policies, practices and systems. There were no accidental releases of regulated chemicals, but nine incidents that involve the hydrogenation process occurred during the preceding five years.  These include the following:\nDate - Process - Description\n3/21/00 - Hydrogenation - Air Products driver noted a small flame present in the vent stack.  Service technician was called in to repair.  No other response required.  No property damage or injury.\n8/10/01 - Hydrogenation - Small catalyst fire when filter housing was opened for repair.  Filters should be flooded at all times to insure catalyst is always wet.  Fire extinguished by staff.  No response required.  No property damage or injury.\n3/3/01 - Hydrogenation - Small leak in catalyst tank piping.  Unit was taken out of service immediately for repair.  Follow-up meeting held to review PM procedure.  No response required.  No property damage or injury.\n3/21/02 - Hydrogenation - All gas detectors alarmed in Lactitol hydrogenation.  Found a bleed valve open which was not listed on L/T checklist.  Follow-up meeting reviewed and updated L/T checklist.  No response required.  No property damage or injury.\n11/26/02 - Hydrogenation - Small fitting cracked on hydrogen storage system.  Notified Air Products for repair.  System was shutdown until repaired.  No other response required.  No property damage or injury.\n6/6/03 - Hydrogenation - Rupture disc blown on Lactitol reactor due to slow response of hydrogen control valve.  Valve controls were adjusted.  No response required.  No property damage or injury.\n6/21/03 - Hydrogenation - Found biral pump white hot with flames.  Activated emergency stop"

No property damage or injury.\n8/12/03 - Hydrogenation - Hydrogen alarms activated in Xylitol hydrogenation building.  Valve had been left open which could have resulted in catalyst spill.  Follow-up action is to install limit switches with interlocks tied into the DCS.  Work orders have been written to have this done in both Lactitol and Xylitol hydrogenation units.  No response required.  No damage or injury.\n3/4/04 - Hydrogenation - Hydrogen storage unit shut down due to loss of all pressure and level readings.  All safety systems worked as expected.  Air Products notified.  No other response required.  No property damage or injury.\n\nThere have been no off-site consequences involving regulated processes or regulated chemicals at the facility.  There is no five-year accident history involving either regulated processes or regulated chemicals that involve significant property damage, personal injury or death.\n\nEmergency Assistance\nEmergency assistance is provided by the Thomson, IL Fire Protection District with mutual aid assistance agreements with Savanna, IL, and Mount Carroll, IL Fire Departments.  Savanna is located approximately 7.0 miles north of the facility and Mount Carroll is located approximately 9.0 miles east of Savanna, for a total response distance of 16.0 miles.  Mutual aid response times are approximately 30 minutes from the initiation of notice.  There is a Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for Carroll County, IL. and is located in Mount Carroll, IL.  Although this organization is formed, it is not active and does not provide emergency response or coordination services at this time.
