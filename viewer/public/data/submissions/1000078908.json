We deliver liquid hydrogen, primarily from our McIntosh, AL plant, into two cryogenic storage vessels.  The liquid hydrogen is then vaporized (converted to gas)and the hydrogen gas is then transferred via pipeline to three nearby customers.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \r\nLiquid Hydrogen is stored on site. The liquid hydrogen is vaporized into gas and supplied to customers via pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\n\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nIn accordance with EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Theodore, AL Hydrogen Station has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.
