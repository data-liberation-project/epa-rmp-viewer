The facility has had no NH3 release since it's last PHA. There have also been no modifications or retrofits since the last PHA. At this update and revalidation all new data elements have been included. The Risk Management Program at  Tri Boro Fruit Co., inc. complies with US EPA and Cal ARP requirements. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) RMP and PSM Guidelines have been implemented at this facility. \n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Tri Boro Fruit Co., inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Packing and storage of grapes..  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include  and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration.\n\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario are included in submitted data however not discussed in this Executive Summary.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTri Boro Fruit Co., inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/20/2005.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tri Boro Fruit Co., inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTri Boro Fruit Co., inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTri Boro Fruit Co., inc. carries out highl"
