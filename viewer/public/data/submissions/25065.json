Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nAtlas Cold Storage believes that our workplace should be run in a manner that reduces and/or eliminates the potential for injuries in the workplace.\nThat the cost of injury and illness to employees and damage to Company property is unacceptable.\nThat no job is so important and no service is so urgent that we cannot take the time to perform them safely.\nThat all employees have an individual responsibility in the Company safety program to protect themselves, their co-workers and Company facilities.\nThat in an attempt to minimize the personal and financial loss that can be caused by accidental injury, Management is held accountable for providing safe work conditions for all employees and applying and enforcing safe work practices.\nTherefore, it is the policy of Atlas Cold Storage to conduct our operations in a manner that will prevent injuries to people and damage to Company property and equipment and the will comply with all applicable  regulations for safety and health.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Safety Director is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs.\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence , and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nB.

The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of the system is 40,000 lbs.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n    The closed ammonia refrigeration system removes heat from the storage and blast freezers of the 2.0 million cubic foot facility.  The refrigeration system provides two-stage and single-stage operation with screw compressors for the -35! blast and -10! freezers.  The sub-zero temperatures are provided with low pressure ammonia suction and liquid lines via pumped recirculating accumulators.  The higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for the machine room.\nC.    Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from V-3 Intercooler.  The V-3 Intercooler operates at 10!F. and approximately 24 psig.\nThe V-3 Intercooler receiver is 5 feet in diameter and 20.125 feet tall.  When 50% filled, the receiver capacity is approximately 8,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\nAssumed is that the release occurs through a circular hole located at the bottom of the Intercooler.  Using EPA-default parameter values, the full content of the intercooler is released within ten minutes through a 1.15-inch hole.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the dis"

The potential for a pipe failure is significant given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility.\nAssumed is the failure of a four-inch pipe connected to the main receiver.  The pipe is 100 feet long with a smooth interior.  The receiver serves as an infinite source of anhydrous ammonia at 77!F. and 131 pounds per square inch.  Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative conditions the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 0.64 miles.\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\nVessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\nActive mitigation considered would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits system to equalize to 50-60 psi.\nD.
