      "SummaryText": "    MT. Vernon Water Plant treats 2 million gallons day from Lake Linville. Plant adds at average 120 lbs chlorine to the raw water which kills bacteria and pathegens. Employees at the water  plant are trained by local fire department personal for the use of SCBA. Also we have to get number of hours for the renewal of our treatment license and some of the renewal hours may contain classroom saftey training on handling chlorine. Personal at plant also has a maintance schedule were we test detectors &  replace pigtales \"o\" rings etc. Emergency equipment on hand SCBA  - ton cylinder repair kit- detection system-ammonia aersol - auto shut off - wind sock. The plant has a license operator on duty 24hrs day. The site were the chlorine is stored is locked at all times and only trained personal is allowed in.\n\n   Mt.
