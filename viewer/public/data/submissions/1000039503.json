The plant site consists of a main processing plant, refrigeration facility, and refrigerated cold storage. The refrigeration facilities use anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the 14 elements of OSHA's PSM program: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Hot Work Permits, Employee Training, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Planning & Response, Contractor Safety, Audits and Trade Secrets \r\n\r\nEmployee participation brings together people that know and understood the system to develop the Program. Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by the refrigeration system. This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia. \r\n\r\nIn order to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia, a system of checks and balances has been established. This system evaluates safety prior to the work being done, and provides a review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed. Standard operating procedures are in place for each operating phase and are followed by the workers who operate or maintain the system. The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained according to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and according to a documented preventive maintenance program.\r\n\r\nA training program is in place for those employees and contractors involved in working on or around the refrigeration system and covers operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. The facility also has a training program for all employees an"
