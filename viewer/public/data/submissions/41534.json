GLNRP has installed a cryognic gas processing plant at the Chalmette Refinery, an eighty mile long 10\" pipeline from Chalmette to Geismar, LA and a fractionation plant in Geismar.  Present personnel complement is 26 for the operations and maintenance activities. \n\nThe Geismar Fractionation Facility separates pipeline liquid natural gases to produce the following pure components:\n\n1.  Ethane\n2.  Ethylene\n3.  Propane\n4.  Propylene\n5.  N-butane\n6.  Isobutane\n7.  Natural gasoline\n\nMost of the liquids are shipped to customers via pipeline.  Some products are shipped by tank trucks.  There is limited on-site storage of products in pressurized tanks.  All products are gases at atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility\n\nGLNRP has developed an overall safety and health policy to prevent accidental releases of flammable materials to the environment.  The policy is supported by many programs such as compliance with OSHAs 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulation which includes communication of risks and hazards to the employees and contractors, the development of an employee training, certification, and retraining program with written operating procedures.  Since the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, it qualifies as a Program 3 facility under EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe facility management also stresses the development and documentation of the process safety information, a management of change procedure, pre-startup safety reviews, employee participation in safety reviews and an equipment mechanical integrity inspection program for all major equipment items a"

Work Areas - as needed\n2.  Portable Fire Extinquishers - monthly\n3.  Pressure vessels - as specified in API\n4.  Extension cords, motorized hand tools - every three months\n5.  Yards, parking lots, roofs, etc. - annually\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years as required by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 regulation.  In addition, incident investigations will be conducted immediately after any accidental release or incident occurs.  The cause of the incident will be determined and appropriate steps are taken to prevent recurrence of the event.\n\nThe facility also has an emergency action plan in the event of a release of a flammable material.  The following provide support for the plant in the event of a fire:\n\n1.  Ascension Parish LEPC\n2. Prairieville Volunteer Fire Department\n\nThe facility engineering staff also follows and adheres to guidelines set forth in American Petroleum Institute (API) standards and recommended practices.  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes for fire protection systems, National Boiler Inspection Codes (NBIC), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel and piping codes, and the National Electric Codes for flammable environments.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nGLNRP has implemented numerous procedures to ensure te safety and well being of its employees and the general environment surrounding the facility.  The process units and storage tanks have been inspected as necessary prior to the introduction of hydrocarbons into the facility.  The facility staff have performed a thorough safety analysis of process.\n\nSince the facility is an OS"

The initial PHAs and subsequent safety analyses included employee participation at the unit operator level.\n\nThe facility has a policy of periodic mechanical integrity inspections, depending on the type of equipment.  The safety relief valves that protect vessels, tanks and piping systems,  are integral parts of this program. \n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Geismar Fractionation Plant is a new facility and there is no five-year accident history.  However, in the time of its operation, there have been no accidents involving a covered chemical.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe Geismar Fractionation Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The emergency action plan is designed to address the facility's main hazard - hazard of fires and/or explosions.  The responsiblities for various functions during the emergency are clearly defined in the response plan.  Gathering places (primary and secondary staging areas, as well as, one off-site staging area) for employees evacuated from the control room and plant area by the emergency conditions are also listed.\n\nThe action plan contains reporting procedures for employees when the fire is too large to be extinguished by a portable handheld fire extinquisher.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental releases including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.
