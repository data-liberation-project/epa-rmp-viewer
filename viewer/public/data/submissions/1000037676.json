The primary products produced at the facility are condensate, propane, butane, and residue gas.  This facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program due to the type and quantities of chemicals that are located onsite.\r\n\r\nThe Chunchula Gas Plant's environmental, safety, and health policies empha the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. The Chunchula Gas Plant has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years. One part of these programs is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. \r\n\r\nThe RMP regulated chemicals onsite are isobutane, butane, ethane, methane, isopentane, pentane, and propane. There are no toxic chemicals that exceed RMP thresholds. The facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, as well as Program 3 of EPA's RMP Rule. \r\n\r\nThe Chunchula Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, to Chunchula Gas Plant employees, and to the preservation of the environment. One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The Chunchula Gas Plant utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  The Chunchula Gas"

      "SummaryText": "Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained emergency response teams will make necessary efforts to contain, mitigate, monitor, and/or stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.   \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe EPA has defined the worst case scenario as the hypothetical rupture and full release of all contents of the facility's largest storage tank, assuming all safeguards have failed, during extremely stable weather conditions. While the probability of this scenario is extremely low, it does provide a template for emergency response planning. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario was determined through the use of the RMP*Comp.  A release of a flammable mixture from the condensate storage tank was used for this analysis.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure depends on the heat of combustion and storage quantity. A vapor cloud explosion of a flammable mixture composed of mostly pentane results in the largest distance to the endpoint (0.9 miles), and, is thus, the worst-case release scenario. A worst case release from this tank would affect a population of approximately 65 individuals.\r\n\r\nFacilities must also prepare an alternative scenario that could have an off-site impact, based on facility operations. The alternative scenario may take into account emergency response control measures and actual storage and weather conditions. The alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst case scenario. \r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the release rates for the alternative release scenarios, the Chunchula Gas Plant choose to use Chapter 9:  Estimation of Release Rates for Alternative Scenarios for Flammable Substances located within the Risk Management Program Guid"

      "SummaryText": "ance for Offsite Consequence Analysis issued by EPA.  This method uses several parameters to calculate the release rate of a flammable substance.  It was determined that this method would provide a more accurate release rate for the alternative case scenario analysis.  Several different scenarios were analyzed using different tanks and chemicals within the storage area. There were no offsite public or environmental receptors affected by any of the scenarios; therefore, only one scenario was chosen.    \r\n\r\nFor the condensate mix which includes high quantities of pentane, a hypothetical release scenario was identified using 10\" seam split.  Calculations estimated that approximately 11,542.95 lbs/minute would be released for 60 minutes which would result in a release of approximately 692,576.9 lbs of pentane. The 2010 census data reported that there were no offsite public or environmental receptors affected by any of the scenarios; however, knowledge of the area demonstrated that there are two homes within the area with an estimated population of 4.    \r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The facility has existing safety features in place applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  These safety features help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  These features include but are not limited to: (1) hydrocarbon/hydrogen sulfide detectors with audible and visual alarms, (2) process relief valves that discharge into the plant flare system, (3) automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process, (4) plant and compressor station emergency shutdowns, (5) fire and smoke detection system with audible and visual alarms, (6) diking to contain liquid releases, (7) redundant equipment and instrumentation such as uninterruptible power supply for process control and safety systems.

The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled. PHAs are performed on an established schedule for RMP processes. A team with a certified PHA Leader performs PHAs on the RMP process and other process nodes not regulated by the standard. The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements and generally accepted industry standards.  The PHA requirement is met by the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Studies conducted at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. The recommendations are then prioritized and implemented accordingly. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is completed in a timely manner. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Health, Environmental, and Safety Coordinator.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates its PHAs of affected units.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Operations Supervisor as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the operating procedures discuss consequences of deviating from the safe limits and provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Changes to operating procedures are tracked through the management of change (MOC) process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial basic training in the Chunchula Gas Plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive ongoing refresher training and refresher courses on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level and to continually enhance the capabilities of the employees."
