This plan is intended to be used in conjunction with Dominion Energy Questar Pipeline, LLC's Process Safety Management/Risk Management Standard Practice and the Skull Creek Dew-Point Plant Operating Procedures.  The plan contains the required hazard assessments, five-year accident history, release prevention program elements, emergency response program, management system to oversee implementation of the program, and personnel assignments responsible for developing, implementing and integrating the program elements.\n\n\n\nSkull Creek DPP is located in a remote area in Moffat County, Colorado, approximately 81 miles Southeast of Rock Springs, Wyoming.  The gas processing plant can process up to 55 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCF/D,) delivered from interstate pipelines.   There are separate process trains used in series to reduce the dew point of the gas: a refrigeration process train and a Joule-Thompson process train. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration process train uses a refrigeration system to chill the inlet gas to reduce the dew point of the gas. The system uses propane as a refrigerant in a closed-loop cycle and the refrigerant is recycled within the system.  By chilling the process gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) condense and collect in a separator.  A Joule-Thompson process train further chills the gas by reducing pressure through a control valve. Upon lowering of the process gas pressure and temperature, NGL in the process gas condenses and collects in separators. The processed gas stream (now known as residue gas) exits the top of the separators and leaves the fac"

An NGL stabilizer removes the lighter hydrocarbon components (mostly methane gas) from the liquid NGL.  Any separated methane fraction is recompressed via an overhead compressor, and re-introduced to the pipeline system.  Stabilized NGL are stored short term onsite in two 30,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks, and then removed from the facility via truck loadout.  Administrative controls on the NGL tanks limit the storage of NGL to 24,100-gallons per tank.  \n\n\n\nTo prevent formation of hydrates during either of the chilling processes, ethylene glycol (EG) is injected into the process stream at various locations. Rich EG (EG containing water) is collected within the separation equipment. Rich EG is transferred to an EG reboiler where water is driven off. EG is then recycled by re-injection into the process.  Heat is required in the NGL stabilizer, provided by circulating hot oil (Therminol 59) through the NGL reboiler. This oil is heated in a skid mounted fired heater located some distance from other process skids, circulated via pumps within a closed loop system and is continuously recycled.\n\n\n\nNGL is a flammable mixture subject to the RMP rule as it is primarily comprised of a mixture of propane, ethane, butane and pentane, with a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Flammability Rating 4 [will rapidly or completely vaporize at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, or is readily dispersed in air and will burn readily (e.g., propane, butane) and flash point below 23?C (73?F)].  The threshold quantity for regulated flammable substances is 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of NGLs at Skull Creek DPP is 48,200 gallons or 198,102 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals or products, as based on an average NGL density of 4.11 pounds per gallon, in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold quantities for flammable substances.\n\n\n\nPropane (used as a refrig"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of Skull Creek DPP, and in implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n"
