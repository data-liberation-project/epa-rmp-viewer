This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Glades Crossing facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring our high standards.\r\n\r\nThe Glades Crossing Gas Plant is operated by American Midstream. The plant is a natural gas liquid extraction LP-Gas processing facility with LP-Gas mixture and LP-Gas storage and sales to wholesale markets. The facility consists of NGL storage tanks with their associated pipeline, valves, pumps, and compressors on site. Natural gas liquids and natural gas are the regulated substances handled in this facility. The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident pr"

Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Glades Crossing Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. The Glades Crossing Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Glades Crossing Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): The Glades Crossing Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the What-if or HAZOP method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: The Glades Crossing Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge"

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors: Glades Crossing uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods for increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR): The Glades Crossing Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: The Glades Crossing facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance mea"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: The Glades Crossing Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires changes to process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The Glades Crossing Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

American Midstream places daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure an incident-free record continues. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction facility, it is our policy to follow our Emergency Action Plan, which is linked with the Jones County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Emergency Response Plan. Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly. All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP). A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed. Employees of this facility are issued individual copies of the Emergency Action Plan when initially hired. All of the opera"

Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\n-The Management of Change provisions ensures we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n-The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\r\n-The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n-Compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection. We encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to learn more about our latest information on emergency response for the county. We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture resulting in a failure of a single natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact.  The NGL release scenario was selected because the two (2) facility 16,000 gallon NGL storage tanks are the same capacity, each exceeding the capacity of the facility 2,000 gallon propane refrigerant storage tank, the other flammable material stored at the facility.  A single NGL storage tank release is evaluated because it is unlikely both tanks would simultaneou"

The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the release scenario.  The worst case release method for a flammable mixture, the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi, was used in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario evaluated for this facility included a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) of a single NGL storage tank as if the contents existed entirely of propane.  This scenario was selected as the majority of the NGL composition is propane and the release calculations give a conservative estimate for the radius of impact.  This type of scenario is unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individuals operate this facility daily.  The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the release scenario.  The BLEVE release method for propane liquefied under pressure resulting in a distance in which the exposure may cause second-degree burns was the basis for evaluating this scenario."
