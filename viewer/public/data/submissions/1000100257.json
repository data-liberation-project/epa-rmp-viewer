Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWe at Daily's Premium Meats are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.\r\nThis commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program\r\nthat covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and\r\nemployee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our\r\npolicy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous\r\nammonia. If such a release were to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control\r\nand mitigate the release. We are also completely coordinated with the South Salt Lake City Fire\r\nDepartment, who provides our emergency response services. In addition, we have a contract\r\nwith L.A. Roser Company to provide 24 hour service and emergency response on the ammonia\r\nrefrigeration system.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nWe have one regulated extremely hazardous substance present at our facility. This substance is\r\nAmmonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be\r\npresent in this facility, based on process calculations, is 14,322 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific\r\nPrevention Steps:\r\nWe have taken the following steps as required by 40CFR, Part 68 of the EPA Clean Air Act\r\nregulation. Our ammonia process is subject to the OSHA PSM regulation, 29CFR1910.119. Our\r\nammonia process is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The\r\nfollowing sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program\r\nthat we have in place.\r\nProcess Safety Information: Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards\r\nassociated with our ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently and\r\nsafely. The methodology used to conduct these an"

Roser Company and are\r\nre-validated at a regular interval of every three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis\r\nare corrected as soon as possible.\r\nOperating Procedures: Daily's Premium Meats maintains written operating procedures. These\r\nprocedures address various modes of operation including initial start-up, normal operations,\r\nemergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and a start-up after a\r\nturnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators and\r\ncontractors involved in the process.\r\nTraining: Our facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\r\nand contractors who are operating the ammonia system are qualified to follow the required\r\nprocedures. Our Maintenance Manager is RETA certified through Garden City Community\r\nCollege, and several other technicians have also received ammonia system training at that\r\nfacility. We evaluate each operator independently to evaluate their readiness to operate our\r\nplant. All employees also receive interactive training through the Alchemy Training System at\r\nleast annually.\r\nMechanical Integrity: We conduct well documented maintenance and inspections for the\r\nammonia refrigeration system to ensure that it is operating properly. Process equipment\r\nexamined during the maintenance and inspections includes pressure vessels, storage tanks,\r\npiping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\r\nOnly qualified personnel with specialized ammonia system training conduct maintenance\r\noperations. Any deficiencies identified during maintenance or inspection are corrected as soon\r\nas possible.\r\nManagement of Change: Written procedures are in place to manage changes to the ammonia\r\nrefrigeration system process, chemicals, technology and equipment.

These reviews are\r\nconducted to confirm that the design, installation, maintenance and operation of the ammonia\r\nrefrigeration plant is safe prior to any equipment operation.\r\nCompliance Audits: We conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions\r\nrequired by the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations are being consistently\r\nimplemented. These audits are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions\r\nnoted during the audits are corrected as soon as possible.\r\nIncident Investigation: Daily's Premium Meats has not had to conduct an incident investigation.\r\nWe are prepared to investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have\r\nresulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. These investigations would be conducted to\r\nidentify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the\r\nincident from recurring.
