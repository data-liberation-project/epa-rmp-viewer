In our Saginaw facility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by United States Environmental Protection Agency.  Chlorine is needed in our milling process, it is necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our coworkers.\n\nWe have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility,  It is our policy to implement controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Our emergency response procedures includes notification of the Saginaw Fire Department and of any potentially effected neighbors.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized plant employees, management personnel and contractors.  Our chlorine system is enclosed within a building on our property.   \n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are Flour milling, grinding wheat into flour.\n\nOur only regulated substance is Chlorine.   Chlorine is used to whiten flour and provide specified baking and cooking properties required by our clients for breads, batter, mixes and similar flour products.\n\nChlorine is received by truck in 2,000 pound cylinders.   A total of eight cylinders are stored in two separate buildings between the main office and mill complex.  Our maximum capacity is"

The Worst Care Release Scenarios and the Alternate Release Scenarios including administrative controls mitigation measures to limit distances for each reported scenario:\nWorst-Case Scenario - Involves our largest vessel of 2000 pounds    released outside, during a cylinder unloading accident that causes rupture of the vessel, with no passive mitigation.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the worst-case scenario is approximately 1.3 miles.\n\n\n        Alternative scenario - A connecting line breaks causing a liquid release through a\nsmall hole approximately 1/4 inch  diameter.  The liquid chlorine flashes immediately\nto vapor and is carried downwind.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm for the             alternative scenario is     estimated to be 0.2 miles.  This release has the possibility of             extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the             Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  One  process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The elements of the standard include: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Reviews, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, and Contractors.  \n\n This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.   Our facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  The delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained in regard to chlorine hazards and emergency response.  Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing ch"

Our chlorine systems are regularly inspected by a chlorine system professionals who make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue the safe handling and use of chlorine.\n\n5.Five Year Accident History:\n\nThere has been no reportable accidental releases, injuries, or environmental damage resulting from our chlorine system in at least the past 20 years.\n\n6.Emergency Response Plan\n\nCargill Incorporated carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid, medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nA process hazard analysis of our chlorine system was conducted on February 4 1997.  From this review, the recommendations were:\n\n        Continued development and implementation of standard operating procedures \n        and scheduled maintenance activities\n\n        Continued implementation of equipment manufacturers' operation and maintenance\n        procedures\n\n        Continued implementation of a mechanical integrity program, including regular chlorine                            system  inspections by qualified system specialist. \n\n        Continued application of the present training program with all employees involved in the\n        chlorination process."
