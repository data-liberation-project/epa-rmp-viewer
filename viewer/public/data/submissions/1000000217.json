      "SummaryText": "F. R. Blankenstein Co. has been under this name since 1939.  Our sales are approximately 80% wholesale/industrial and 20% retail.  We stock and sell welding, restauarant, janitorial, paper, water treatment, swimming pool and household supplies and equipment.  All merchandise purchased from our suppliers is bought, received and sold as it comes from them.  Nothing is  repacked, relabeled,manufactured or otherwise altered.\n\nFor over 40 years we have bought, stocked and sold 150 lb. cylinders of chlorine gas (from Tesco, then Thompson-Hayward, and now Harcros).  During this four decade span we, with our suppliers, have held safety training seminars every two to four years for our customers.  Factory qualified people demonstrated safety kits and put on training programs, including slides, film, and video tape.  All water works, waste water systems, fire departments, and interested industries were invited and most attended.  This was being done long before there were government regulations.  We do not sell chlorine gas to anyone other than those named.  We do not sell chlorine gas to any swimming pools or individuals. \n\nSince then the local fire departments have state trained firemen (as many as 18 in the department in  Natchez) with the knowledge and equipment to handle leaking 150lb. cylinders, 1 ton cylinders and railroad tank cars.\n\nWe work closely with the Natchez Fire Department and the Adams County Civil Defense.  The Fire Department brought each fireman on each of three shifts to our warehouse and video-taped our whole facility as we walked through it discussing hazards and plans in case of an emergency. Should an emergency occur we immediately call: 911; Natchez Fire Dept.; Adams Co. Civil Defense; MEMA; and Harcros Chemical Company."
