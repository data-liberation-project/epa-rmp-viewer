      "SummaryText": "A.  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGenpak LLC (Genpak) produces foam polystyrene food trays and containers using a single screw and tandem system of extruding expanded polystyrene foam sheets.  The process takes polystyrene pellets through an extrusion process where a nuclient and blowing agent (isopentane) are added.  The sheets are then thermoformed and cut to produce the final product.\n\nIsopentane is delivered to the Genpak-Montgomery facility via tank truck.  The tank truck is unloaded into a 12,000 gallon aboveground storage tank (AST) using a transfer pump.  Administrative controls are in place which limit the capacity of the tank to 85% of its maximum, therefore, the maximum amount of isopentane which can be stored in the AST is 10,200 gallons/51,000 pounds.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of isopentane vapors to the atmosphere during product transfer.  Isopentane is pumped from the AST to the isopentane pump room where the pressure is increased, and injected into the extruders.\n\nAs a result of the manufacturing process, isopentane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the threshold limits outlined in EPA regulations.  Genpak-Montgomery has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Genpak\n\nGenpak-Montgomery is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate response to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nSafety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC.  Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations Genpak performed the following offsite consequence "

Genpak elected to use the look-up tables contained in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document to calculate estimated release rates and to determine the distances to the appropriate flammable endpoints.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Genpak-Montomery was calculated assuming that the entire contents of the AST (10,200 gallons/51,000 pounds) of isopentane is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool in the containment area located underneath the storage tank.  The quantity of isopentane that is evaporated from the liquid pool in the first 10-minutes of the release was then assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud ignites.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  Using Equation C-1 from the guidance document, the distance to an overpressure level of 1 psi from the explosion of the vapor cloud was calculated to be 0.10 miles (528 feet).  There are no environmental receptors located within the 0.10 mile radius.  However, there are major commercial/office/industrial areas within this radius.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nThe alternate release scenario for the Genpak-Montgomery facility was calculated assuming an O-ring failure which results in a 1/4-inch hole in the union located on the 3-inch unloading line, underneath the AST.  The unloading line is equipped with an automatic shutpff valve which is activated when a leak of isopentane is detected.  This shutoff valve is situated after the union with the leaking O-ring.  The scenario results in the formation of a liquid pool containing approximately 302 pounds of isopentane which evaporated, came in contact with an ignition sourc"

The release rate and evaporation rate from the pool of isopentane were calculated using the guidance document assuming that no mitigaton was present.  The distance to the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) for this scenario represents the maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences.  The distance to the LFL for this release, assuming urban topography, D stability and a wind speed of 3.0 m/s, calculated to be <0.10 miles (,528 feet).  There are no environmental receptors located within the 0.10 mile radius.  However, there are major commercial/office/industrial areas within the radius.\n\nD.     Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, the Genpak - Montgomery has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\nE.     Prevention Program Elements\n\nGenpak-Montgomery has developed and implemented all program elements as required by RMP rules and regulations, as follows: \n\n- Management System\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Management of Change (MOC)\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Contractors\n\nF.     Emergency Response Program\n\nGenpak will only respond to incidental releases of isopentane where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.  For non-incidental releases Genpak will rely on outside responders.
