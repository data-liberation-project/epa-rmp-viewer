      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nFacility Overview, Process Description, and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Baker Hughes, a GE company, operates a facility located in Taft, California. The facility's primary activity encompasses the manufacturing and transfer of acrolein, a chemical used in oilfield and agricultural applications, into bulk storage containers and then into transfer and shipping/dispenser containers.  We also rework and service the containers.  The acrolein is used as a pesticide and algaecide for crop protection and a sulfide scavenger, biocide, and corrosion inhibitor in oil field applications.\n\n\n\nProcesses at the facility are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] for Acrolein production, storage and loading processes containing more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8) and propylene (CAS No. 115-07-1). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  Propylene is a flammable substance which is a gas at ambient conditions, but is stored as liquid under pressure at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe production process uses air, propylene, and steam to manufacture specification-grade acrolein by a catalyzed reaction of the listed raw materials.  Raw materials are passed through the reactor vessel catalyst to produce raw acrolein and byproducts.  The acrolein is separated from the other reactant byproducts and residues in a series of quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.  The finished spec-grade acrolein is collected in three 1,000 gallon process tanks pending quality evaluation, and ultimately transferred into dedicated ISO-containers on flatbed railcars for storage prior to repackaging.\n\n\n\nA maximum inventory of 260,000 lbs of propylene can be on site at any one time with up to 130,000 lbs of propylene per railcar storage vessel and a total of two (2) railcars o"

The process generates approximately 700 lbs/hr of acrolein, with up to 30,000 lbs present in a single ISO-container and a total of twelve (12) ISO - containers on the rail siding and up to four (8) ISO-containers on truck chassis for temporary/overflow storage.  \n\n\n\nThe acrolein ISO-container storage is the dividing point between the manufacturing and packaging operations.  The storage is the end point of the manufacturing process and the starting point of the packaging/storage operations.  In the packaging area, the facility is capable of holding approximately 1,800 individual containers of finished acrolein product staged for shipping to customers.  Approximately 170,000 lbs. of acrolein is packaged per month, with variable daily rates of fill depending upon existing inventory and customer demand.\n\n\n\nTo supplement the manufactured supply of acrolein for packaging, a truck rack for unloading incoming loads of acrolein also exists in the packaging area.  ISO-containers of acrolein are received on flatbed truck trailers and unloaded into the railcar mounted ISO-containers for storage prior to repackaging.  Although multiple ISO-containers on trailers can be held in storage at the plant, the process only allows for unloading of one at a time.\n\n\n\nBaker Hughes and Taft Manufacturing Company are committed to the ongoing safety and sustainability of our operations.  To ensure the protection of our employees, our neighbors, and the environment, we have implemented a HSE management system that utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein and propylene are handled in a safe manner. Details of the facility's prevention program are summarized in the following sections.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTaft Manufacturing has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA as well a"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information- \n\nA detailed record of safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes is maintained at the facility and accessible to all employees at all times.  Regular review of the process safety information is conducted to verify it is current and accurate.  The information is consulted when making decisions about possible equipment and procedural changes, when conducting hazard reviews, and when training, among other uses.  The current set of process safety information is always consulted prior to conducting any PHA for the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses - \n\nAt least once every 5 years, a skilled and knowledgeable team including personnel with expertise in engineering, plant operations, and/or maintenance conducts a comprehensive study to identify hazards associated with our processes are ensure they are effectively mitigated or eliminated.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is scaled to fit the complexity of the process, and may be HAZOP, WHAT-IF, or CHECKLIST methods.  Non-management employees are always included in the study, and involved in making suggestions to improve the safety and environmental operation of their work environment.  Any employee not directly participating in the PHA is informed of the recommendations in a company meeting, and given access to the tracking program to see the progress towards completion of the recommendations.  All recommendations are completed within 2.5 years of the PHA, with the majority being completed within a year of the study. "

To inform any contractor of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes on the site, and annual orientation is conducted and records are maintained.  Additionally, embedded maintenance contractors are provided regular training on the written maintenance procedures and Preventative Maintenance Plan for the facility.  All Contractors are informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and safety data sheet (SDS) of all chemicals on-site are made available upon request. Each contractor submits their own site-specific health and safety plan to inform their own employees of the expectations for safe performance. Taft Manufacturing also uses temporary labor occasionally to help with staffing of the packaging area.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Frequency of inspection and the procedures followed are set based upon manufacturer's recommendations for the equipment.  In the absence of manufacturer's equipment, Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) are used to determine an appropriate frequency.  To assist the maintenance teams in tracking maintenance activities, the facility uses the CMMS program Maximo.  Using this database, management can review the information to analyze frequent failures or otherwise identify areas of the facility in need of additional review.  Maintenance records as a whole are reviewed at least annually to identify facility trends and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - \n\nTo ensure the safety of the process and to ensure all operators are informed of change before it is enacted, the facility has a written management of change procedure covering changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the intended change, allowed to provide input to the intended change, and provided training to deal with the modification. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review - \n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - \n\nAt least once every three years the PSM/RMP progra"

The team follows known audit protocol and identifies any corrective actions required to ensure the integrity of the management system.  Actions resulting from audits are tracked in a database accessible to all employees, and are closed in a timely manner, typically within a year of the receipt of the audit report.  Audit findings are shared with all employees in a company meeting and updates on progress in completing recommendations are likewise shared.  The two most recent audit reports are kept in the facility file and are accessible to any employee who wishes to view them.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - \n\nTaft Manufacturing Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.   Recommendations from the investigations are tracked for implementation in the HSE database and are accessible to all employees.  Findings and corrective actions from investigations are shared with employees at the facility, as well as across the company to improve performance from lessons learned.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - \n\nBaker Hughes and Taft Manufacturing are fully aware that effective process safety and accident prevention requires a team effort.

In each case, additional correction was applied using the hierarchy of controls and applying elimination of the hazard or engineering controls as a first correction, and changing procedures/administrative controls as a secondary correction.  Neither of the incidents resulted in serious injury, and were first-aid level injuries only.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes response procedures for all magnitude of incidents from minor first aid/near miss response to major events including medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nAll operating procedures include instructions on identifying emergency conditions within the plant, and mitigation measures to prevent a release.  In the event that those emergency response protocols fail, and a release of material from the process does occur, all facility operators are trained in donning of protective gear and responding to the area of the process to contain and control the release only.  Facility personnel are not trained in rescue or fire-fighting (beyond incipient stage fires) and will not respond to rescue.  After critical operations personnel have responded to place the plant in fail-safe mode, they will evacuate.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment, including fire sprinklers, monitors, deluge systems, and extinguishers, is regularly inspected and serviced.
