      "SummaryText": "Hukill Chemical Corporation has developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP) because of the amount of 70% Hydrofluoric Acid (HF-70) that is kept on-site.  HF-70 is stored on-site in a diked 10,400 gallon storage tank, and in up to approximately 180 55-gallon drums in their warehouse.\n\nAn analysis of a worst case release scenario, as defined by the EPA rules, and more likely alternate release scenarios, selected from EPA guidance documents, was conducted and is documented in this plan.  The alternate case release scenarios indicate that a radius of less than two-tenths of a mile would be included in the distance to toxic endpoint. \n\nHukill developed and Accidental Release Prevention Program as part of this Risk Management Plan.  Most of the Prevention Program elements, such as training, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures, were already in place prior to the development of this RMP.  The Prevention Program is designed to operate and maintain the system and the equipment in a manner that will reduce the possibility of an accidental release.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Bedford Fire Department."
