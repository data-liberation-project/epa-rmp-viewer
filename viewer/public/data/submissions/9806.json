      "SummaryText": "1.0 Toca Gas Plant Risk Management Plan:  Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Shell Western E&P Inc. (SWEPI) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\tSUBSTANCES\n\nSWEPI operates the Toca Gas Plant located in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.  Tejas Natural Gas Liquid, LLC is the owner of this facility.  The Toca Gas Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of two processing plants, Toca I and Toca II.  Toca I is a refrigerated absorption plant.  Toca II is a cryogenic plant.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility via pipeline.  Residue gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, SWEPI identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. \n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Toca Gas Plant are rich/lean oil, raw make, propane, natural gas, sponge oil, heating oil and slop oil.  However, SWEPI has determined that heating oil and slop oil have an NFPA flammability hazard rating of 2 and 3 respectively, which exempts these mixtures from threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Toca Gas Plant is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Toca Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable. Rich/lean oil is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.53-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for propane as follows.  A 2-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared during loading causing the entire contents to empty from the truck tank.  The propane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for propane. The alternative-case release of propane resulted in a 0.28-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Toca Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case  or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Toca Gas Plant.  Because the processes at  the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\nOperating Procedures\nThe Toca Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup (2) normal operations (3) temporary operations (4) emergency shutdown (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.
