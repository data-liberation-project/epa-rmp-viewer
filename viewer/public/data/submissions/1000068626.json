      "SummaryText": "and Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\r\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenario for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, Appendix F: Supplemental RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants. For alternative release scenario analysis, the release rate and distance to endpoint for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide was EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, Appendix F: Supplemental RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, Exhibit F-14, Release Rates and Distance to the Endpoint for Chlorine Vapor Releases as well as Exhibit F-18, Release Rates and Distance to the Endpoint for Sulfur Dioxide Vapor Releases. \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest chlorine or sulfur dioxide storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor in an outdoor setting within 10 minutes of tank failure. An urban setting was chosen as the topographical setting. Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles corresponding to an endpoint chlorine concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (volume/volume) or an endpoint sulfur dioxide concentration of 0.0078 mg/l or 3 ppm is reached. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario - An outdoor release of chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas due to valve failure was considered for the alternative release scenarios. It is assumed that mitigation occurs within one hour of the start of the release under neutral weather conditions. As in the worst-case scenario, an urban topographical setting was chosen. The more likely indoor release scenarios were not chosen because the facility is equipped with a scrubber system that is designed to activate upon detection of a leak.  The scrubber system prevents the gasses from escaping to the outside an"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe City of Coon Rapids, MN West Water Treatment Plant uses the chemical chlorine for the purpose of disinfection of the city water supply and sulfur dioxide for de-chlorination prior to distribution of the water. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.) The City of Coon Rapids is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and feed processes at our facility. It is our policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends on the safe handling procedures that we use combined with the safety devices included in the design of this facility and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nIf a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide should occur, we are coordinated with the Coon Rapids Emergency dispatcher and in turn the Coon Rapids Fire Department and Emergency Operations Coordinator, who will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of an unforeseen release.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Coon Rapids, MN West Water Treatment Plant has two regulated substances, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, at the facility. Chlorine, a toxic gas stored under pressure as a liquid, is used for disinfection of the city's water supply. Sulfur dioxide, also a toxic gas under pressure, is used for de-chlorination prior to distribution.\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility at any time is five 2,000-pound tanks, for a total of 10,000 pounds. The maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide at our facility at any time is three 2,000-pound tanks, for a total of 6,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario"

      "SummaryText": "d would prevent an offsite release above the endpoint value.\r\n\r\nThe maximum distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm (v/v) for chlorine and 0.0078 mg/l for sulfur dioxide is 0.1 miles for either chemical. It is possible for a release of this nature to extend beyond the facility boundary, however it is unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Coon Rapids, MN West Water Treatment Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in 40 CFR part 68. The Plant is also in compliance with OSHAs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Rule as specified in 29 CFR 1910.119. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders are handled minimally outside of the facility and are stored indoors. The facility is designed with both chlorine and sulfur dioxide detection systems that automatically activate a caustic scrubber system in the event of an indoor release. Additionally, a vacuum demand delivery system automatically stops the flow of chlorine or sulfur dioxide if a piping or valve failure causes a vacuum loss. Water Treatment Plant operators are competent in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.\r\n\r\n5. Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Coon Rapids MN West Water Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the history of the facility. There have been no documented releases over the last five years.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nEmergency Response by the Coon Rapids, MN West Water Treatment Plant employees will be limited to incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the City of Coon Rapids Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. In the event of a catastrophic event, the City of Coon Rapids' com"
