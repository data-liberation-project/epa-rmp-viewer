Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\r\nThere has been one incident in the last 5 years that resulted in minor offsite impact, and required off-site assistance.  The site has performed an in-depth investigation of the incident and determined primary and contributing causes.  The site has also implemented corrective actions to prevent the occurrence of other, similar incidents with the plant's chemicals.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nPeoria  County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified, primarily through the county Emergency Coordinator.\r\n\r\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nFrom time to time, findings result from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Consequently, The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant continuously improves and updates operating and maintenance procedures, replaces and/or maintains equipment to original - or higher - specifications and/or design codes and develops and implements both capital and expense projects to improve both plant automation and EHS performance. Such improvements are part of our continuous improvement efforts at the site."

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant believes process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. Employees participate in engineering design reviews, Pre Start Up Safety Inspections, PHA's, and attend regular meetings where incidents, MOCs, mechanical integrity and other topics related to process safety are discussed.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, contractor safety performance is evaluated.  The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and site processes through a comprehensive safety orientation prior to beginning work on site.  Part of the orientation includes familiarizing contractors with emergency response procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State Building Codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Mapleton Metal Organics Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out this hazard analysis was HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years or whenever significant process changes occur.  Representative employees from the plant operations and maintenance are always included. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are subsequently addressed.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Mapleton Metal Organics Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup af"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at the Chemtura Mapleton Metal Organics Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Timber Hollis Fire department  and the Peoria County Emergency  Planning Coordinator, providing additional emergency response expertise. \r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities are  the manufacture and distribution of aluminum alkyls. We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are ethylene and ethyl chloride.  The regulated substances are used in the manufacture of aluminum alkyls.  The maximum inventory of ethylene  at our facility is  60,000lbs. while ethyl chloride  is  present at our facility in quantities up to 120,000 lbs. \r\n\r\n3.Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternate case scenarios have been calculated and impacts have been assessed for the site's covered chemicals.  Administrative controls and mitigation measures, intended to limit the distances and impact for each reported scenario, have been documented.  Alternate release scenarios listed in 68.28(b)(2)(i) through (v) have been considered.\r\n\r\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have the EPA's ALOHA software for release"
