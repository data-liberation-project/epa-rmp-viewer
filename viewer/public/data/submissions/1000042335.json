      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics-Chattanooga, TN\r\n\r\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics Company is an ISO9001:2008 and AS9100C manufacturer of multilayer co-fired electronic packages.  Processes revolve around 30 plus years of experience in material science, engineering, design, tooling and manufacturing of multilayer ceramics.  AdTech Ceramics provides High Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (HTCC), Ceramic Feedthroughs, Multi Layer Aluminum Nitride (AlN), Chemical Ceramic Milling, and Injection Molded Ceramics to the military, aerospace, medical device and other high reliability applications industries.\r\n\r\nSystem Overview\r\n\r\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics Company has a process by which anhydrous ammonia is \"dissociated\", or broken down, into its elemental components, nitrogen and hydrogen.  Saturated anhydrous ammonia vapor is piped to dissociator units that heat the ammonia to 1750\u00b0F, thereby facilitating separation of the NH3 molecule into its component parts, nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) gases.  These component gases mix to become process gas used for firing kilns and furnaces in a controlled atmosphere free of oxidation.  Anhydrous ammonia is supplied by tanker truck through a liquid filled connection.   Emergency shut-off valves are provided at both the liquid filled and vapor return line to allow quick shut-off of liquid and vapor flow in the event that there is an accidental pull-away of a truck or a hose rupture.  Ammonia is stored in a liquid state in equilibrium with its vapor at saturation conditions in a pressurized vessel.  The vessel is maintained at approximately 125 psig by an electric vaporizer controlled by pressure switches modulating the heat input to the ammonia vaporizer.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage Vessel\r\n\r\nAmmonia storage includes a 12,000-gallon stationary, horizontal, cylindrical pressure vessel for storing liquefied anhydrous ammonia.  The storage vessel is d to provide approximately 90 days of continuous supply of dissociated ammonia"

The ammonia storage vessel temperature is monitored through the local indicator.  The level in the vessel is monitored through the local gauge.  An alert system including a horn is installed for leak detection and high level alarm.  The ammonia tank pressure is indicated through a local gauge.  The tank is equipped with two (2) sets of dual pressure relief valves set at 250 psig atop 3-way valves; excess flow valves at all fluid flow nozzles; and thermal relief valves set at 350 psig on associated liquid ammonia lines.\r\n\r\nAmmonia  Dissociators\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia vapor is piped from the top of the storage tank at 125 psig and is reduced to 35 psig to provide constant pressure feed to the dissociator vessels.  At each of the three (3) dissociator vessels the NH3 vapor is again reduced to 12 psig for introduction into the pre-heater.  NH3 vapor is then piped into the catalyst chamber and heated to approximately 1750\u00b0F.  The dissociated ammonia gas (DA) is then piped into the plant for use in the kilns and furnaces as process gas. Atop each dissociator vessel piping is a Kunkle pressure relief valve set at 15 psig.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced Technical Ceramics Company has diligently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release.  The facility has not had an accident in the past five years involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently implemented for the ammonia process. Futhermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia proces"
