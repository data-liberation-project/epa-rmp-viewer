The Ed Love Plant is a 45.7 million gallon per day treatment plant that consists of aluminum sulfate (ALUM) for coagulation, lime for pH control, fluoride for tooth decay prevention, chlorine for disinfectant and orthopolyphosphate for corrosion inhibtor.                                                                                                                                                                                   The source water for the plant is Lake Tuscaloosa that has a capacity of 40 billion ghallons and is a very clean water source. Raw water turbidity averages around 6.0 NTU. The backup to Lake Tuscaloosa is Lke Nicol, a four billion gallon lake and Lake Harris a one billion gallon lake.

The plant has two one ton cylinders that are on line and connected to a common header and consume 1200 lbs per day at maximum capacity of plant. The chlorine is in liquid form and is vaporized and fed into the post chemical mixer and into the finished water.                                                                                                                                                                                       Maintenance operators and plant operators  work daily on changing chlorine cylinders and follow the procedures for RMP for changing cylinders.Maintenance personnel check all lines from the valves on chlorine cylinders that connect the valve to the manifold feed. As cylinders are being changed out, the exhaust vent is energized to remove any fumes from the chlorine room. All operators and maintenance personnel check self contained air supply and protective clothing in case there is a discharge. The scrubber is filled with a 12% solution of sodium hydroxidev (NaOH) in order to neutralize the chlorine. The concentration of the chlorine is checked monthly in order to maintain the 12% concentration. The scrubber has the capacity to withstand a one ton release.
