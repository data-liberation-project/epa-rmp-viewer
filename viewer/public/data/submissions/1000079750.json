Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Foam Plant, as part of the Woodbridge group of companies, believes the health & safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, is of the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating & maintaining all of our processes in a safe & responsible manner.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n\n\nComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\n\nReview and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety, & environmental improvements.\n\n\n\nOur complete Health, Safety, & Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility.\n\n\n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and to ensure protection of the environment.  Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source & Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Atlanta Foam Plant is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry.  The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals a"

Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, vacuum or mechanically crushed, trimmed, and prepared for shipment to customers.\n\n\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck, and is stored in 2 tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 210,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\nContractor Awareness\n\nHot Work Permitting\n\nMonthly Workplace Inspection by members of the JHS&E Team\n\nSafety Information\n\nHazard Reviews of our Processes\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTraining\n\nEquipment Maintenance Programs\n\nRMP Compliance Audits\n\nAccident/Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have an established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines both the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce those hazards.  Controls are in place to reduce exposure to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems are setup for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and c"

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Atlanta Foam Plant has only had one instance that required reporting under EPA's five-year accident history report. This was an overpressurization of a TDI tank during filling. The accident was handled promptly on-site to limit health and environmental impacts. Due to the quick response, no TDI was released to the environment and no employees were injured. New controls will be installed with the repair of the tank to help prevent a recurrence of the accident, and the facility will strive to ensure that no additional accidents occur in the future.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nAs a non-responding site to the RMP chemical, the facility meets the Emergency Action Plan requirements and addresses them in the site Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). Actions that are taken by facility personnel and addressed in the ICP include activation of the local emergency notification system and calling 911 from a safe location [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(1)] and directing an evacuation, including exit route assignments [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(2)]. All employees are trained to assist other employees in a safe and orderly evacuation [29 CFR 1910.38(c)(2)]. Should the scope of any incident exceed the capability of our staff, such as a large release, the employee discovering emergency shall follow the protocol provided in the ICP to notify facility personnel, isolate the covered process if safe to do so, evacuate the facility and perform headcount at the designated muster point, and contact emergency responders. We maintain an ICP, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training to effectively protect workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
