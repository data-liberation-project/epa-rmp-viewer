      "SummaryText": "Galloway Company produces condensed sweetened milk and other dairy products.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our refrigerated tanks and product coolers. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Safety and Regulatory Compliance Manager is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGalloway Company produces condensed sweetened milk and other dairy products. Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Galloway facility.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employee Participation Program\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the Galloway facility over the past five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Galloway facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with the Neenah Menasha Fire Rescue.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGalloway Company is committed to operating our ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and responsible manner. We are evaluating changes to the ammonia detection and ventilation systems to improve safety at the facility."
