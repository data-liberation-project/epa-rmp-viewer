The Jasper WWTP consists of several wastewater treatment processes, including Chlorination, High Rate Trickling Filtration, Sedimentation and Biological oxidation. Treated water and sludge, following disinfecting with Chlorine, is then disposed of in accordance with State and Federal laws.\n     \n     Chlorine gas has been in use for nearly a century as the choice disinfectant in the treatment of both sewage for discharge and surface and ground water for drinking.  Currently the Jasper WWTP maintains a maximum inventory of 6,000 pounds of both Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide gas.  Under EPA's Risk Management Program, Clean Air Act 112(r), any industry utilizing Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide, regulated gases, above the threshold quantity of 2,500 and 5,000 pounds respectively, must develop a Risk Management Plan and implement a Risk Management Program.  \n\n     The Jasper WWTP, in implementing their Risk Management Program (RMP), is currently undergoing changes in both process design and operations, as well as improving on their emergency response preparedness plans.  The Plant is currently prepared to respond to incidental leaks of either gas, and have on hand self-contained breathing equipment, ton container repair kits, escape respirators, first aid stations, and fire extinguishers located throughout the facility.\n\n     In the spirit and law of the RMP, the Jasper WWTP recognizes and is pursuing optimal public involvement in response to regulated substance emergencies.  The Jasper WWTP acknowledges that as a result of being in compliance with the RMP Rule, the safety of the surrounding community as well as that of on-site workers is significantly enhanced.

      "SummaryText": "WWTP is dedicated to minimizing the risk of using Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide gas while at the same time improving the quality of local services.  \n\n     Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide gas is required at the Jasper WWTP for disinfecting sewage prior to further treatment and disposal.  Chlorine gas is the disinfectant, and Sulfur dioxide is added to chemically react with excess Chlorine.  Too much Chlorine in the wastewater can lead to the formation of carcinogenic compounds, therefore Sulfur dioxide is required to remove it.  The Jasper WWTP recognizes that Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide gas, if accidentally released into the environment, may cause severe injury and even death for a significant distance from the source.  The Jasper WWTP has recently adopted new policies under its RMP to prevent and prepare for the uncontrolled release of a regulated gas from the Plant.  \n\n     The Jasper WWTP  is currently owned and operated by the Jasper Water Works & Sewer Board of Jasper, AL. The Plant covers thirty four acres of fenced land, and is overseen by the General Operations Manager, Mr. Don Welch (256) 221-2141.  The Chief Operator of the plant, Mr. Howard A. Bell, will be the person who has the primary responsibility for the implementation of the RMP.  Mr. Bell's responsibility under the RMP will include the training and execution of the facility's safety, environmental  and emergency response programs.  Additional individuals may be assigned responsibility for implementing individual requirements and will report to Mr. Bell on delegated matters.  Responsible individuals will communicate information to other employees involved in operation and maintenance of the regulated process involving Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide gas, as required.  All responsible individuals so involved will be listed by name, title and duties, in the RMP located on site at this facility.\n\n    Any material changes in the design or maintenance [except for \"replacements in kind\"] of the current regulated "

The public may contact the Jasper WWTP by calling (256) 387-0142 or the Jasper Water Works & Sewer Board at ((256) 221-2141) for additional information regarding the Jasper WWTP Risk Management Program.\n\n     The Jasper WWTP currently maintains up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substance, process, and equipment, including Material Safety Data Sheets for Chlorine, maximum intended inventories, and safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures and process flows for the regulated substance.  Equipment specifications and process design Codes and Standards are also maintained in the RMP document on site. \n\n     In the case of an uncontrolled release of Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide gas from the Jasper WWTP, an integrated Emergency Response Plan has been adopted involving the coordinated effort of several organizations, including the local Fire Department, Emergency Management Agency, Police, Sheriff's office and Medical Emergency services and Hospitals.  The Jasper WWTP is prepared to assess and repair incidental or controlled leaks of the regulated materials but is currently not authorized to respond to uncontrolled releases of either Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide from their facility.  Instead, the Jasper WWTP has coordinated first response assistance from federally regulated Hazardous Materials (HazMat) specialists.  \n\n     Currently the Jasper Fire Department cannot legally respond to an emergency which requires containment of either Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide gas.  However, Level A suits are being ordered which is the principal reason they have not been certified as HazMat specialist. The Jasper Fire Department is currently up to date on HazMat training and will be qualified to serve as first responders once they have acquired the proper equipment.  In addition to their HazMat training, the Fire Department has planned to join the Water and Wastewa"

For the next few months the Jasper WWTP will continue to rely on emergency assistance from local volunteers and neighboring counties. \n\n\n     EPA requires each regulated facility to analyze a Worst-Case Scenario release for each of its regulated substances.  A Worst-Case Scenario is the release of the entire contents of a regulated substance container.  In addition EPA requires as well an Alternative-Case Scenario for each regulated substance in which the released regulated gases are brought under control at some point following uncontrolled release events.\n\n     In the both Worst-Case Scenarios, for Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide, both of which are detailed within the facility's RMP, a scenario is considered in which the uncontrolled release of the entire contents of a ton container of gas occurs.  There are no mitigation features included in these Worst-Case Scenarios, such as enclosed buildings or other structures, during the release of these regulated gases.  The endpoint radii for such a release, in which injury to those exposed is potentially possible, was calculated using parameters which are facility specific as well as criteria provided by EPA.  The endpoint radii was calculated to be 3.0 miles for Chlorine, and 3.1 miles for Sulfur dioxide, following the loss of the entire contents of a one ton container gas.  Close to the source of such a release the potential for serious injury is high. \n\n     The safety mechanisms in place at the Jasper WWTP are designed to prevent the Worst-Case scenario from occurring.  One of the principal mechanical lines of defense are the vacuum regulator valves on the ton containers of both Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide. These valves release gas from the ton container only when a vacuum is applied, hence, if a line should break in the process manifold of either Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide, the regulator valves on the sour"

Other physical devices in place include detectors capable of setting off alarms when the atmospheric concentrations of Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide rise above 1 ppm, about the level detectable by humans.\n\n     Although the potential for an entire ton container of the gas to escape the Plant's boundaries is unlikely, it can happen.  The EPA requires all responders to such a release to coordinate with the local Emergency Management Agency, the Fire Department, HazMat specialists and other local authorities such as the Police Department and Sheriff's office, in order to effectuate the best plan for evacuation efforts, if needed, and other requirements to assure the greatest protection for those who may be exposed to the gas.  As described below, recommendations have been submitted regarding improved maintenance and safety, the introduction of a community siren system, as well as initial response activities developed through coordinated efforts with the participating agencies and rescue organizations.\n\n     As part of the Worst-Case scenario Emergency Response Action the cooperating agencies considered, and is currently implementing, procedures for responding to sensitive receptors within the endpoint distance of the regulated gas.  For example, local Schools, Hospitals and other sensitive receptor sites are currently being integrated into the community's Emergency Response Plan through the efforts of the Fire Department, LEPC, Police Department and others.  Cooperative interaction between the various rescue organizations is enhanced under the RMP Program.  An evaluation of the potential impact of released gas on the surrounding environment is also included in the RMP. USGS maps showing the effected areas within the endpoint distance are filed within the facility's RMP.  The estimated population within the 3.0 mile endpoint radius is 6,900 persons for Chlorine and 7,200 within the 3.1 mile endpoint radius of Sulfur dioxide.\n\n     In the Al"

      "SummaryText": "ternative Release Scenario the Jasper WWTP adopted conditions of an uncontrolled release in which the failure of a check valve results in the release of the regulated gas for a period of  approximately 60 minutes.  At this time the gas leak is arrested and brought under control by emergency response personnel.  The endpoint radius for Chlorine was calculated to be 1.2 miles (Jasper WWTP chose a scenario provided by the AWWA's Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants).  Mitigation features which would impede the dispersal of the released gases, such as an enclosed building, were integrated into the Alternative Release Scenario calculations.  The population of Jasper affected within the 1.2 radius is estimated at 760 persons.\n\n     For the Alternative Scenario with Sulfur dioxide the Jasper WWTP chose the failure of a 3/8 inch line which leaks uncontrollably following failure of the automatic shut off valve to close.  The release is assumed to occur for 60 minutes prior to being arrested.  The endpoint radius distance for this scenario is 0.3 miles, or approximately 1,500 feet from the source.  Population calculations from the 1990 Census indicate that approximately 140 persons would be subject to exposure if not evacuated in time.  Preparations for this scenario include a rapid response to the area by local Fire, Police and Sheriffs and subsequent evacuation of persons who may be in harm's way.  Once the local Jasper Fire Department is fully certified to become first responders a scenario such as this would be assumed to be under control within 30-40 minutes, thus lowering the potential endpoint radius significantly.\n\n     Currently the regulated gases are connected to the Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide processes in a fire proof, brick building located in the Southeast corner of the property.  A two ton hoist system removes the ton containers from delivery trucks and secures them inside this building for processing.  Chlorine dete"

In the event of a partial release of Chlorine or Sulfur dioxide gas it is anticipated that the bulk of the gas will be contained within the immediate vicinity of the Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide building since there is a thick forested woodland down gradient from the regulated gas storage area.  \n     \n     There has been no accidental release of Chlorine gas beyond incidental events, such as minor leaks, in the last five years.\n\n     During the development of the Jasper WWTP's RMP Program several recommendations were made which are currently being addressed.  Recommendations were introduced for windsocks, sirens, upgrading engineering process materials and instruments, and further upgrading Jasper WWTP's standard operating procedures for all process activities which are material to the Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide process.  In addition, training will be improved and documented assuring that all Operators at the Fort Payne WWTP are competently trained in the design and everyday handling of Chlorine gas."
