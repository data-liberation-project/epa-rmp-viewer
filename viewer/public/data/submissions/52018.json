      "SummaryText": "1.  Facility Policy.  The owners, management and employees of Alliance Ag. Coop. Company are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release occurs, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Adams County LEPC and/or other authorities, to mitigate the release and minimize its impacts on the public and the environment.\n2,  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of fertilizer products to farmers.  The fertilizer product anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in tanks designed for that purpose.\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The facility follows the provisions of the 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous Ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n4.  Five-year Accident History.  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years that met the RMP reporting criteria.  To our knowledge, there have not been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan. Employees are trained to respond to minor releases of ammonia, but we do not plan to have our employees respond to major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release, call 911, and call all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.  There are no specific safety recommmendations regarding the strorage or the use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
