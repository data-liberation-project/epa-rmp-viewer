In fulfilling this commitment, management systems are in place to provide the resources and training to maintain compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, ensuring that safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Accident prevention is emphasized through strict operating procedures, safe work practices, ongoing training and administrative and operational controls. While continually striving to prevent accidental releases, should one occur, the refinery maintains a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team for fast response and incident mitigation and control.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery Carson Plant, located in Carson, California, is a petroleum refinery that converts various crude oils into intermediate products. The Carson Plant supplies Tosco's Wilmington Plant with these intermediate streams and they are subsequently used to produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. Other co-products of the refining processing such as coke, sulfur, and carbon dioxide are sold directly from the Carson Plant. The refinery produces and/or uses regulated flammables, including propane, butane, hydrogen and mixtures of regulated flammable substances. Tosco's Carson Plant does not exceed the EPA threshold quantity for any RMP regulated toxic substance.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nTosco's Los Angeles Refinery, Carson Plant has no regulated toxics in quantities that exceed listed federal threshold values, therefore; this Risk Management Plan contai"

Controls to prevent and/or mitigate such a release were not considered during this evaluation, therefore; the butane is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite into a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for these WCSs would include offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a VCE resulting from a release of butane during railcar loading. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this ARS includes offsite impact in the immediate vicinity of the refinery. \n  \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe Tosco Los Angeles Refinery has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that follows the elements found in the OSHA PSM standard to prevent incidents from occurring. The following is a summary of these elements and a description of the management system that is in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation is regarded as essential to the continuous improvement of the LAR PSM program, and hence in the prevention of accidents. LAR has a written employee participation policy that outlines the many ways in which employees are involved in the accident prevention program, and employees have access to all information generated within the program. All process hazard analysis teams include an experienced unit operator, and employees are also members of teams formed for compliance audits, incident investigations and pre-startup safety reviews. The plant emergency response team is comprised of qualified employees who receive specialized training and participate in e"

Employee assistance is enlisted to develop training programs and operating procedures and compile other critical process information. Additionally, LAR has various safety programs designed to increase plant safety by encouraging employee involvement. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLAR maintains key technical documents that contain information essential to safe operation of the various processes. This information is accessible to employees to facilitate the identification and understanding of hazards posed by chemicals used or produced in the processes and includes chemical hazard, process technology and equipment information.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) have been compiled for all chemicals used onsite, whether or not they are deemed hazardous. MSDSs include information regarding a chemical's toxicity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability, permissible exposure limits, hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing with other materials and other physical data.\n\nOperating Information Manuals have been prepared for the various process units. Information available in the manuals includes process flow diagrams, safe operating limits for process parameters, consequences of deviation from design criteria, controls, alarm and shutdown settings and inventory.\n\nEquipment design and construction documents on file include information such as process and instrumentation diagrams, construction specifications and materials and electrical classifications.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nLAR conducts a comprehensive program to identify potential hazards that may be associated with processes in the various units and thereby control/properly manage them.\n\nThe Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique is the type of process hazard analysis (PHA) utilized at LAR to ensure that a systematic study of each process is carried out.

The typical HAZOP team includes a knowledgeable operator and engineer who systematically analyze detailed process drawings to identify potential hazards. These potential hazards are assigned a risk rank according to specified criteria. The team evaluates accident prevention and mitigation measures already in place and makes recommendations if they believe additional measures are necessary.\n\nFindings of the team are documented and reviewed by management for resolution. Hazards assigned the highest risk rank are given priority, thereby ensuring that each hazard receives the appropriate attention. All approved mitigation measures are tracked to completion. Documentation is retained as to the resolution of all PHA findings.\n\nRevalidation of PHAs are conducted at least every 5 years, or when a major process change is to be implemented, to ensure that process controls do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features. Again, documented findings are forwarded to management to ensure that critical mitigation recommendations are implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nLAR has set forth detailed written procedures with step by step instructions for the various modes of process operations, including startup, normal and temporary operations, emergency operations and shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures are accessible to employees for reference and training and kept evergreen by revisions implemented through the management of change process, periodic review and annual accuracy certification. \n\nTraining\n\nAll employees of LAR that are involved in operating a process are trained in the process and its operating procedures. This training emphasizes safety and health hazard issues, emergency operations and safe work practices.

Employees involved in maintaining process equipment integrity are trained on the process, its hazards and safe work practices and procedures.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAdherence to safe work practices is deemed imperative at LAR to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These safe work practices include: 1) a permitting system to authorize and control any hot work (spark-producing) activities, 2) a confined space entry permitting system, 3) procedures to safely remove hazardous materials from equipment and piping prior to performing work on or within them, and 4) a lockout/tagout system to confirm that equipment undergoing maintenance is isolated from its energy source.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nAll process changes that occur at LAR are managed via a comprehensive management of change (MOC) system. Managed changes include those to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures and facilities. Special consideration is given to the technical basis for the change, as well as safety and health impacts, operating procedure modifications, time period for the change and authorization requirements. All changes are reviewed and approved by knowledgeable personnel from various disciplines to ensure that potential new hazards are managed and any controls in place are not adversely affected. Affected employees and contract workers receive training on the change prior to its implementation. In addition, process safety information and operating procedures are revised to reflect any changes.\n\nIncident Investigation \n\nShould an incident occur that results in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of regulated substances, LAR promptly begins a thorough investigation. A knowledgeable investigation team determines the cause and develops corrective action recommendations to prevent recurrence. Manageme"
