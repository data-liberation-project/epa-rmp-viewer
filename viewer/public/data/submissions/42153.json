This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n* Acknowledge the construction and operation of a new source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\n\nMEC uses aqueous ammonia at a concentration of approximately 30% (by wt) and stores greater than 20,000 lbs making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is not subject to either the OSHA or EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 2 facility.\n\nThe RMP addresses the Program 2 requirements of CalARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 2 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n* identify hazards\n\n* design and maintain a safe facility\n\n* prevent releases\n\n* minimize the consequences of releases.\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\nThis RMP applies to the MEC facility located at:\n\n1 Blanchard Rd.\n\nSan Jose, CA. 95013\n\nUTM: N 4119623m, E 611409m\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Metcalf Energy Center (MEC) is a 600-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant, with a 230-kilovolt (kV) switchyard"

No new transmission towers will be required. Natural gas for the facility is delivered via approximately one mile of new 16-inch pipeline that is connected to an existing PG&E transmission backbone pipeline that runs along the eastern side of U.S. 101. Recycled water for cooling is supplied by the South Bay Water Recycling Program (SBWR) and is delivered from a tap into SBWR?s existing main pipeline in eastern San Jose via a new 20inch, 7.3-mile pipeline. Industrial wastewater and sanitary sewer from the plant is transported from the plant via a 12inch (maximum) forced main installed in the same trench as the recycled water pipeline and connected to San Jose?s sewer system downstream of any system constraints. Process makeup water and domestic water is supplied from the city?s municipal water system (San Jose MUNI) via a 1.25-mile pipeline or from new onsite wells. This supply will also serve as a backup water supply for plant cooling. \n\nThe site is located just west of Monterey Road, between Metcalf Road to the north and Bailey Road to the south.\n\nSubstance Used/Stored:    Aqueous Ammonia <=30% Solution (CAS# 1336-21-6)\n\n                Ammonium Hydroxide, 15000 gallon tank\n\n\n\nFacility SIC Code: 4911    Facility NAICS Code: 221112\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency action policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0 respectively.

The Santa Clara County and/or City of San Jose Fire Departments will be the first responders in an ammonia emergency. MEC personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, MEC personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. The fire departments will handle spill/release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, MEC may join forces with the fire departments and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\n\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n\n* Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, piping network, flow controllers, and injection grid.\n\n* Monitoring of tank and system pressures and temperatures.\n\n* Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\n\n* Installation and use of ammonia detector(s) in the main tank area.\n\n* Installation and use of closed circuit cameras to view the ammonia storage area.\n\n* Provide all required safety and response equipment.\n\n* Provide a chemical specific training program.\n\n* Access to the MEC facility site is controlled and fenced.\n\nThe piping and distribution network is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console.  All liquid (aqueous ammonia) carrying piping is dual contained. Review of the P&IDs (Appendix C"

Data developed from the operational experience at these facilities will be directly applied to the operation and safety aspects of the MEC facility. Operational and safety issues identified at any Calpine facility are immediately analyzed for applicability to other operational sites. Additionally, the following will be used to identify and track safety improvements at MEC.\n\n* Completion of the initial PHA on January 10, 2005 for the MEC facility\n\n* Required periodic updating of the PHA per the CalARP regulations\n\n* Implementation and revision to safety and training procedures\n\n* Completion of the seismic ?walk-down? inspection\n\n* Completion of the CBO?s inspection of construction, i.e.,?ascertain compliance with applicable building and seismic codes\n\n\n\nThe facility will constantly strive for improved performance and reliability from all its processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified they will be evaluated by staff for application and implementation.\n\nTraining\n\nThe facility staff, as well as Calpine corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of listed substances can be reduced and/or eliminated by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.\n\nThe training program is comprised of the following:\n\n* Initial employee training\n\n* Periodic re-training and certification\n\n* Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification \n\n* Refresher training\n\n* Training records for eac"

This scenario results in the release of approximately 481.5 pounds of ammonia. The toxic endpoint value of 201 ppm is not exceeded at any location, i.e., on or offsite. Ammonia concentrations reach a peak value of approximately 43 ppm, with fence line concentrations on the order of 40 ppm. No offsite population impacts occur under this scenario, and the zone of impact is entirely within the facility boundary.\n\nThe alternate release scenario is the failure of the tank truck vessel unloading hose with the spill contents being discharged to the loading pad surface, which drains to an underground sump. This scenario results in the release of approximately 14.9 pounds of ammonia. The toxic endpoint value of 201 ppm is never reached, and fence line concentrations are on the order of 6 ppm. Therefore this scenario will not affect any offsite populations, and the zone of impact is entirely within the MEC facility boundary.\n\nIn addition to running OCA scenarios for the CalARP and federal toxic endpoint value, the worst case and alternate release scenarios were also evaluated for the California Energy Commission COC HAZ-4 value of 75 ppm (30 minute averaging time). The COC-HAZ-4 worst case release shows a fence line concentration of approximately 74-75 ppm, while the COC-HAZ-4 alternate release scenario shows a fence line concentration of approximately 10 ppm.
