The JV will be known as Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene, JV. The Ethane Cracker (C2 Cracker), LDPE, LLDPE and Utilities units were registered by the previous owner\\operator under Sasol North America.  These units will now be registered in this RMP as the Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene, JV. and operated by Equistar Chemicals, LP. All the chemicals were previously registered, and the only significant change is that there are no toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity (TQ) as specified in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and guidelines.\n\n\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene Joint Venture is committed to operating and maintaining its processes to protect the employees, the public, and the environment. A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities used to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.

In addition, Ethylene is polymerized, and an assortment of products are produced as polyethylene plastic pellets. The site has one Ethane Cracking unit and two Polyethylene Units- one Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and one Low Linear Polyethylene (LLDPE) manufacturing unit.   These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their substantial accidental release: \n\n\n\nToxics - \n\n\n\nNo toxic chemicals used inside the units are above the threshold quantity.  Although the design was for Chlorine gas to be used, the line from supplier was blinded off and bleach is being used instead.\n\n\n\nDichlorodimethylsilane (DMDS) used in the LLDPE unit is below the threshold quantity and thus not reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlammables - \n\n \n\n\n\n1,3-Butadiene:  Approximately 5 million pounds are stored in tanks and railcars as well as portions of mixtures within process equipment.  It is sold as a finished product.\n\n\n\nEthylene:  Approximately 1.67 million pounds are produced in the C2 Cracker.  It is used internally to produce LDPE and LLDPE.\n\n\n\nEthane:  Approximately 1.5 million pounds are stored and used on-site. It is used as feedstock for the units and pumped to a underground storage dome.\n\n\n\n\n\nPropylene:  Approximately 5.7 million pounds are stored and used on-site. It is used in the Olefin units as a compressed gas for refrigeration and reboilers.\n\n\n\nFlammable Mixtures:  Regulated substances in flammable mixtures are:  1,3-Butadiene, Butane, 1-Butene, cis- and trans-2-Butene, Ethane, Ethyl Acetylene, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isobutylene, Methane, 2-Methyl-"
