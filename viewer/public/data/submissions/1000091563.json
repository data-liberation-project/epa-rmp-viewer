The JV will be known as Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene, JV. The Ethane Cracker (C2 Cracker), LDPE, LLDPE and Utilities units were registered by the previous owner\\operator under Sasol North America.  These units will now be registered in this RMP as the Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene, JV. and operated by Equistar Chemicals, LP. All the chemicals were previously registered, and the only significant change is that there are no toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity (TQ) as specified in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and guidelines.\r\n\r\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene Joint Venture is committed to operating and maintaining its processes to protect the employees, the public, and the environment. A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities used to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. The site emergency response personnel also coordinat"

      "SummaryText": "e with the Calcasieu Parish LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene, JV. uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. In addition, Ethylene is polymerized, and an assortment of products are produced as polyethylene plastic pellets. The site has one Ethane Cracking unit and two Polyethylene Units- one Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) and one Low Linear Polyethylene (LLDPE) manufacturing unit.   These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their substantial accidental release: \r\n\r\nToxics - \r\n\r\nNo toxic chemicals used inside the units are above the threshold quantity.  Although the design was for Chlorine gas to be used, the line from supplier was blinded off and bleach is being used instead.\r\n\r\nDichlorodimethylsilane (DMDS) used in the LLDPE unit is below the threshold quantity and thus not reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlammables - \r\n \r\n\r\n1,3-Butadiene:  Approximately 5 million pounds are stored in tanks and railcars as well as portions of mixtures within process equipment.  It is sold as a finished product.\r\n\r\nEthylene:  Approximately 1.67 million pounds are produced in the C2 Cracker.  It is used internally to produce LDPE and LLDPE.\r\n\r\nEthane:  Approximately 1.5 million pounds are stored and used on-site. It is used as feedstock for the units and pumped to a underground storage dome.\r\n\r\n\r\nPropylene:  Approximately 5.7 million pounds are stored and used on-site. It is used in the Olefin units as a compressed gas for refrigeration and reboilers.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixtures:  Regulated substances in flammable mixtures are:  1,3-Butadiene, Butane, 1-Butene, cis- and trans-2-Butene, Ethane, Ethyl Acetylene, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isobutylene, Methane, 2-Methyl-"

Employees participate in PHA's and they have access to the PHA's and other process safety information, the employees review operating procedures on a yearly basis to ensure updates and correctness of procedures.   \r\n\r\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained and uses this as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility. All contractor workers must attend the Safety Council of South West Louisiana training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant. In addition to basic training, Louisiana Integrated Polyethylene, JV. onsite specific training is required prior to entering the plant.  The company has a rigorous process for pre-screening all contract companies to ensure they meet all company requirements.\r\n\r\n4.0 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\n1. The facility had a small flash fire on July 6, 2019 during a normal operating procedure being executed during a routine sampling activity in the LLDPE Unit. One employee was injured during the flash fire and no off-site impact occurred.\r\n2. The facility had an ethylene decomposition on January 132020 in the LDPE Unit that resulted in a fire during the start-up of the unit. The fire damaged equipment and two employees sustained minor first aid injuries when they tripped and fell while evacuating the area. No offsite impact occurred from this event.\r\n\r\nNo meetings on the incidents were held with the LEPC due to COVID-19 restriction from the LEPC office\r\n\r\n5.0 Emergency Response\r\n\r\nThe site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all the various federal, state, and local regulatory requireme"
