      "SummaryText": "Effingham Equity is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspecitons and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidential release occur, the facility has oriented the Dieterich Volunteer Fire Dept. and the Effingham County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response and minimize the impact of the release in our community and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and alternate case scenario, however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including the Illinois Department of Agriculture regulations as well as OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nEffingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 0 1910.38.  Emergency planning and community right to know informations is provided to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, LEPC and the local fire department as required by SARA Title III of EPCRA.\n\nImproving safety at Effingham Equity is an on-going process.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implentation at this time."
