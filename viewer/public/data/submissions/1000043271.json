The chemicals are transferred from the rail cars or trucks to individual storage tanks except for some minor ingredients, which are stored in drums or totes. \r\n\r\nAll of the ingredients, except for MDI, are blended in-line according to the foam formulation and mixed using a dynamic mixer. That polyol based mixture and the MDI are pumped separately to 3 pairs of high pressure pumps. In some cases, a preblend of the polyol and some of the ingredients might be made and used in place of straight polyol.\r\n\r\nThe high pressure pumps boost the pressures of the polyol mixture and the MDI streams and supply 3 mix heads. Within the mix heads, the polyol mixture and MDI streams are brought together at high pressure and intimately mixed. That mixture immediately begins to foam.\r\n\r\nThe foam is poured from the mix heads onto a conveyor line that moves the foam through each step of processing. The liquid foam is poured onto a facer material in evenly spaced intervals and the foam and facer travel to the laminator to be heated. At the laminator entrance, a top facer is brought down onto the foam. In the laminator, the foam rapidly expands to the pre-designated thickness and solidifies. Next the foam moves down the line to be trimmed and cut to pre- measured lengths. Once the foam is cut to , it is stacked, wrapped, and cured in a warehouse. It is later shipped to customers.\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nGAF has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices. Stringent material and contractor requirements have"

Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe GAF Isocyanurate Foam facility in Cedar City, Utah is a new facility and has not had any incidents to date.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams.  Additional training with outside organizations is also conducted.\r\n\r\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\nSince this is a new facility, no planned changes to safety system have been identified at this time."
