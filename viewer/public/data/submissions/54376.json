The contents of this RMP and PSM document Rich Product?s compliance with the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r)(7), 40 CFR 68, and 29 CFR 1910.119 for the protection of employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThe Rich Products facility is located at 3555 East 14th Street, Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas, at North 25.91728 Latitude and West -97.47252 Longitude. The responsible official at the facility is Eddie De La Rosa, Production Manager. The food processing operation utilizes Ammonia (Anhydrous) in its process. A single tank on the north side of the property houses 23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The container has manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency, and an alarm will trigger if a release occurs. Emergency air supply and power are available. The facility remains staffed twenty-four hours a day. Employees check the anhydrous ammonia processes routinely throughout the day.  The facility maintains two Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatuses (SCBA) within the facility, however Rich employees are not first responders in the event of an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\nNo accidental anhydrous ammonia releases have occurred at this facility"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of the Ammonia to the air. The 23,000 pounds worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by a single vessel. The RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of Ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 23,000 pounds of Ammonia is 1.9 miles. The estimation of total potentially affected population within the entire area of the circle is 56,275 persons. \n\nClean Air Act regulations require that the alternative release scenario selection is more plausible than the worst-case scenario. The scenario selected involves a valve failure/pipe failure. This failure results in the release of the entire contents of the container over a period of 30 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 767 pounds of Ammonia per minute. The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.2 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of Ammonia to reach the toxic endpoint (0.14mg/L) as a result of a 30 minute release of 767 pounds of Ammonia per minute. No potentially affected population lives within the area of the 0.2-mile alternative release radius.\n\nA search of U.S. Geological Survey maps did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint. Environmental receptors include natural areas (national parks, state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges) and federal wilderness areas.\n\nIt was determined that the facility that stores and uses Ammonia was designed, built, and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines. Continuous inspections as to the integrity and the condition proce"

The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at minimum once every five years. \n\nRich Products ensures that each employee presently operating the Ammonia process, including each newly assigned employee, has been successfully trained or tested in the operating procedures. Annual refresher training provided to each employee operating the chlorination process ensures that the employee understands and adheres to the current operation procedures of the process.\n\nRich Products facility Employee Participation Plan is as follows and is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.83. The plan requires personnel to participate in the Process Hazard Analysis, to have access to analysis records, and requires management to consult with employees on Process Hazard Analysis, standard operating procedures, emergency response, training, and other information regarding the facility. \n\nThe Rich Products emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can be expected to occur at the facility. Effort has been made to identify potential causes and consequence scenarios; however, it is possible that an event could occur that has not been foreseen. The Program Hazard Analysis and the Hazard Assessment are examples of this effort. The emergency procedure complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nRich Products maintains a written emergency response plan that includes specific instructions in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia. The plan is in accordance to 40 CFR 68.180 as stated in 4.2. It includes public notification protocol, and emergency health care (the MSDS includes emergency health care information). Rich Products employees received HAZWOPER training in December 2008. \n\nThe City of Brownsville Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility?s Emergency Response Program. Both departments are members of the Cameron County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision "
