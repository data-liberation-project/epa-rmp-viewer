      "SummaryText": "The Cargill Meat Solutions - Nebraska City, NE primary business is processing wholesale distribution of meat products for human consumption. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  \r\n\r\nFacility release modeling was performed using EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp. The worst-case scenario is based on the High Stage Accumulator as that vessel could potentially hold the largest quantity of ammonia. No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenario. \r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario is based on a situation from reckless driving, a truck backing into a pressure vessel. Other alternate cases were considered, including vessel overfilling, over pressurization scenarios, pipe ruptures and material handling and transfer hoses. \r\n\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/ RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility has an emergency action plan in place and conducts periodic response drills and coordinates with the local fire department a"

      "SummaryText": "nd LEPC. The facility is committed to continually improving safety through program implementation and execution. The facility has never experienced a release incident that meets the EPA's 5 Year Accident Reporting criteria involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The main floor system shutdown can be manually operated using a switch located outside the engine room.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska City facility did not have any process expansions requiring the addition of ammonia since the last RMP resubmission. However, the total quantity onsite shows and increase due to new and more accurate methods available for calculating the maximum intended inventories onsite. The maximum intended inventory calculation is conservative for modeling purposes but does not reflect the normal operating inventory that is kept onsite for daily operations."
