      "SummaryText": "1.The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\nThe Na-Churs/Alpine facility located in Corydon, Indiana complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our ammonia storage system, it is our policy to immediately notify the Harrison County Sheriff's Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use. The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia. The ammonia storage process consists of two above ground storage tanks (13,000 gallons each) and associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n3. The worst case scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential failure of a 13,000-gallon storage tanks (the largest vessel) filled to 90% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each ammonia tank to 90% capacity), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization. Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) was determined to be 0.3 miles. The public receptors affected under this worst-case scenario include private residences, office and or industrial facilities. The residentail population within this 0.3 mile radius is approximately 72 persons, which was estimated using EPA's Environmental Justice Geographic Assessment Tool.\n\n4. The alternative release scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential release of ammonia through the transfer hose (i.e. caused by the rupture of a connection between the ammonia unloading station piping and"

      "SummaryText": " the ammonia delivery tanker truck), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization. The release rate of ammonia from the 2\" diameter transfer hose with an initial operating flow of 85 gallons per minute was determined using RMP* Comp, to be 600 pounds per minute to the outside air. It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 3 minutes. Therefore the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 1880 pounds of ammonia. Utilizing RMP* Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.2 miles. The public receptors affected under this scenario include private residences, offices and or commercial facilities. The residential population within this 0.2 mile radius is 32 persons, which was estimated by EPA's Environmental Justice Geographic Assessment Tool.\n\n5. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law at the Na-Churs facility in Corydon, Indiana.\n\n6. Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility has never had an accident involving its ammonia storage process. The accident history includes no events resulting deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n7. The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving ammonia storage system, it s Na-Churs' policy to immediately notify the Harrison County Sheriff's Department, who would respond to the emergency. We have communicated this policy with the Harrison County Sheriff's Department.\n\n8. Planned changes to improve safety: None"
