Therefore, this section is not applicable.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Manteca Facility is not a First Responding facility and therefore employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Wilbur-Ellis Manteca Facility has filed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that follows the requirements of the CCR Title 8 \u00a73220, with the local fire department and the local CalARP authority.  The responding fire department is located approximately 2.8 miles from the facility and inspects the facility on a regular basis; and has participated in facility emergency response drills.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements. To improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia system, Wilbur-Ellis is in the process of developing a more comprehensive anhydrous ammonia inspection checklist for the bullet tank system and nurse tanks.  The comprehensive checklist will include daily, weekly, and annual inspection frequencies, including visual and non-destructive tests to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks, valves, piping, etc. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry standards.  \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is also implementing a facility-wide comprehensive corrective action/preventative action (CAPA) log to track and facilitate completion of listed CAs on a timely basis.  Recommended improvements and identified deficiencies from the inspection checklists, compliance audits, and PHA studies will be included on the facility CAPA log along with the priority, employee responsible, and targeted completion dates."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers, including regulated substances:  Anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored at the site in an 18,000 gallon bullet tank.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia to 82% of the bullet tank capacity. The total capacity stored onsite is 56,000 pounds; which is based on the number of gallons stored onsite (12,000 gallons) and the specific gravity of ammonia (0.682).\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 14,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqueous ammonia, based on 24% ammonia by weight and the specific gravity of ammonia, is approximately 50,300 pounds. \r\n\r\nThe anhydrous and aqueous ammonia at the facility is considered retail, since anhydrous ammonia from the facility is delivered directly to the farmer (end user), thus is required to follow the EPA RMP Program 2. However, the facility currently follows the CalARP Program 3 requirements for anhydrous ammonia and Program 2 for aqueous ammonia as required by the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, the CalARP Participating Agency (PA) for the local"

The findings and corrective actions that resulted in the Hazard Review Update have been incorporated into the Facilities Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  The completion on the corrective actions and safety improvements are tracked on the facilities CAPA Log that is kept onsite and monitored by the corporate EHS department.  \r\n \r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis part of the Hazard Assessment was reviewed and revised June 2014 and is summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the worst-case release scenarios is defined as a release from the largest storage vessel at the facility. The anhydrous ammonia worst-case scenario is a release of 56,000 pounds from the anhydrous ammonia bullet tank.  The aqueous ammonia worst-case scenario is a release of approximately 25,133 pounds of ammonia from one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks.\r\n  \r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the alternative-case release scenarios is defined as a release scenario that is more likely than the worst-case release scenario. The anhydrous ammonia alternative case scenario is a release during the transfer of ammonia from the bullet tank to a nurse tank. The aqueous ammonia the alternative-case scenario is a release from a 4-inch hose during the transfer between a storage tank and the delivery truck.\r\n \r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalational hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).
