Process safety information, consisting of technical standards, specifications and levels, promotes safe process design and operation.  Process hazard analysis evaluates hazards against safeguards needed to mitigate likelihood of an accidental release. Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.  \r\n\r\nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.   \r\n\r\nThe facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release, in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring.

As a non-responding facility, the RMP emergency response program and emergency response plan requirements (40 CFR 68.95) are not applicable at this facility.  However, the facility does maintain an emergency response plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify first responders, secure critical operations before evacuation, evacuate the facility, and account for personnel, among other items.  Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their limited role in response to small accidental releases.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\nThe Director of Terminal Operations has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program at this facility.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Winona Terminal is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors in the surrounding community and the environment.  This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Winona Terminal is a facility which receives propane by railcar.  The propane is stored on site in above ground storage tanks and then delivered to market via transport vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSeveral storage vessels and railcars were evaluated.  There is one worst case release scenario associated with release of 380,000 pounds of propane from a 90,000 gallon storage vessel.  The entire inventory of the vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, impacting an area with a 0.6 mile radius.  The release has the potential to affect a public receptor and the vessel is therefore considered part of a Program Level 3 process.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is associated with a sheared propane discharge pipe, releasing 180,000 pounds of propane in 10 minutes, when isolation valves mitigate the release.  The propane is assumed to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, impacting an area with a 0.3 mile radius.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility"
