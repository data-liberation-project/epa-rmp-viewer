If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, County Emergency Management, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\nThis facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 20 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or the use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time.\n\n"
