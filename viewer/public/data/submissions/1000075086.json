Anderson Water Treatment Plant has established a Risk Management Plan according to Federal EPA's (40 CFR Part 68) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) regulations to enhance already existing safety and emergency action programs.  City of Inglewood is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees, the communities where its facilities are located, and customers.  City of Inglewood staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nCity of Inglewood has an emergency action plan in effect to handle potential emergencies at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan provides notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards and mitigation procedures that will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated periodically and has been reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP and CalARP regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe City of Inglewood Sanford M. Anderson Water Treatment Plant maintains chlorine on-site for use in disinfecting water treated by the plant.  There is a single chlorination building located at the facility housing the chlorine containers.  Chlorine gas is supplied under vacuum from the containers to the chlorinators which regulate the chlorine feed.  Downstream of the vacu"

      "SummaryText": "um regulators installed on each container, the system is operated under vacuum as a safety measure.  The vacuum is created at the chlorinators by water flow through a set of injectors.  In case of a break, the vacuum regulators close automatically minimizing the quantity of chlorine gas that may escape from the system.  Also, the entire system is connected to the gaseous side of the container.  This is also an important safety feature.  Chlorine detectors are provided for the chlorination building to maximize safety and minimize release of any chlorine gas from the storage building into the atmosphere.  The detectors alarm locally and remotely. \r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nCity of Inglewood Sanford M. Anderson Water Treatment Plant has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of the implementation of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to PSM, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed.  Also, common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute are implemented in system design and day-to-day system operation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe five-year accident history (November 2013 to December 2018) for the City of Inglewood Sanford M.
