Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ely Siding facility is owned/operated by Plains Midstream Canada. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until marketing can find a suitable market for the liquids. Propane (odorized) is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Ely Siding facility in amounts above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n?    Correcting non-compliance found during re"

However, they do operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since operations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Ely Siding Facility within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Bellows Falls Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?    The Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n?    The Hazard Review provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety s"

Compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n\n?    An ongoing dialogue with the local Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
