The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nIneos  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nIneos  carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Ineos to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ineos .  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIneos conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the prov"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nIneos  truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nIneos  hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Ineos  has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nIneos  has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release meeting the RMP definition during this period.\n\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nIneos  carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  A new ambulance and an off-site response vehicle were purchased in 2004.  A new fire truck was purchased in 2005.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA project was initiated to review the Hot Work permitting system. A team of Process Technicians, the Safety Supervisor, and Maintenance Representatives reviewed the existing process for compliance and efficiency. The process was updated to include a permit to work process so that all work in the process unit was covered.  Additionally a safety analysis was integrated into the process.  Previously this was done in a separate function.  The revised process has been operation for almost a year and has been determined to be a significant improvement in overall safety and it has improved both maintenance and operations efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                            A splash wall was installed on top of the Hydrogen Cyanide storage tank dike wall.  This wall will minimize spill over to adjacent areas in the event of a complete tank failure.  Plant Analyzer Houses were upgraded to include Oxygen detectors and auto shutdowns for personnel protection.

      "SummaryText": "lonitrile process as is currently in use  was originally introduced in the late 1950\u00bfs by Sohio.  The Lima plant currently in operation was the second generation design, built in 1966 and is the current design of favor for licensee plants built around the world.  The Green Lake Plant, ANIII, was the third generation design and was built as a stand alone plant, totally self-sufficient.  The new design plant at Green Lake employed a few design changes to help minimize waste products and disposal.  One of these changes was the introduction of the \u00bfHot\u00bf quench system.  The Lima design plant utilizes a cold quench system where the temperature of the quench system is controlled via cooling water exchangers for an outlet temperature of about 115\u00baF on average.  The Green Lake quench was designed to run with the aid of cooling water and operates at about 180\u00baF.  Lima's design was updated to a similar quench system in the 1990s with the exception of retaining the cooler quench water temperature.  They have shown better efficiencies with this cooler temperature so this project added exchangers to obtain lower quench water temperatures similar to the Lima plant.  This change did not affect our release scenarios.\nIneos  Green Lake RMP Executive Summary \r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at  Ineos  are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.
