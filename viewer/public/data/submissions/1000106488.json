The facility is enclosed by fence and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThis terminal complies with all Federal and state rules and regulations that govern the storage,\nhandling and transportation of propane. It also complies with the EPA's Accidental Release\nPrevention Rule. The terminal was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58 code for the storage and handling of propane. Periodic inspection of the entire system is done to ensure continued safe operations. All maintenance and improvements are done per the latest NFPA code in effect at the time. Regulatory authorities, to ensure that it is operated and maintained properly, inspect this terminal. The employees are trained as required by the appropriate codes and regulations using the Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\nEmergency response program:\nThe emergency response plan at this terminal was based upon the NPGA bulletins Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How to Control Small Leaks and Fires and the CETP training program. Employees are trained in emergency operating procedures such as\ncontrolling sources of ignition and leaks. Employees are not trained in emergency medical response and are not equipped to respond to offsite releases.

Terminal staff will not respond to\naccidental releases of flammable substances at our facility but has coordinated response actions with the local fire department. Our response plan includes procedures to call the local emergency responders such as the fire and law enforcement departments as well as any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled:\nThe regulated substance handled at this terminal is propane. The purpose of this facility is to store propane for distribution to wholesale customers. Most of the propane is received by rail car and stored in 4 large storage tanks. Up to 12 rail cars may also be stored on site at any given time. In rare cases, it is received by truck transports. This facility is equipped to unload rail cars and truck transports. It is set up to load transports and bobtails; however, the majority of the propane is loaded"
