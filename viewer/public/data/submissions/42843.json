      "SummaryText": "LignoTech USA, Inc. (LTUS) manufactures lignosulfonate specialty chemicals by using non-toxic solutions known as spent sulfite liquors and other regulated and non-regulated substances. A solution of formaldehyde, a regulated substance, in water is used as a raw material. Propane, another regulated substance, is used a back-up fuel for certain processes.  LTUS (and its predecessor companies) have manufactured lignosulfonate specialty chemicals for over seventy years while continuously striving to protect the environment, our employees and the community from the hazards associated with these regulated substances. LTUS has excellent accident release prevention programs for formaldehyde and propane.  These programs are strictly enforced.\n\nAn extensive Process Hazardous Analysis has been performed for formaldehyde and the hazards identified have been corrected. A worst-case scenario for formaldehyde has been determined to be a rupture of the storage tank containing a maximum amount of 7650 gallons.  Due to an exceptional passive mitigation system, less than 1 pound of formaldehyde will be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes. The distance to endpoint with wind speeds of 3.4 miles per hour is 0.1 miles. The estimated residential population within this distance is 45.\n\nAdditionally, an extensive Process Hazardous Analysis has been performed for propane and the hazards identified have been corrected. A worst-case scenario for propane has been determined to be a vapor cloud explosion caused by the total release of propane from the storage tank. The distance to endpoint of 1 psi overpressure with wind speeds of 3.4 miles per hour is 0.4 miles. The estimated residential population within this distance is 650. The Rothschild Elementary School will be affected.\n\nIn the past five years, we have had no release of formaldehyde or propane from their respective storage tanks or distribution systems.  Our Emergency Response Program has been prepared according to the requirements o"
