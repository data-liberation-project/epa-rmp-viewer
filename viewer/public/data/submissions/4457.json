      "SummaryText": "The City of Azusa water treatment facilities use the acutely hazardous material (AHM) chlorine in sufficient quantity to warrant the establishment of a RMP program.  Water is treated with chlorine at two sites in Azusa, employing the same basic chlorination process at each site.  The primary water treatment facility for the City is the Canyon Filtration Plant.  Chlorination was first introduced at the Canyon Filtration Plant in 1960.  The original system operated with chlorine gas under pressure.  In 1990, the current chlorination system, which operates at a slightly negative ( vacuum ) pressure, replaced the original equipment.\n\nThe City of Azusa Water Division has had no accidents involving the use of chlorine for water treatment.  Even with Azusa's outstanding chlorine-management safety record, during the course of the RMP document, consideration was given to a wide range of postulated accident scenarios, including fire-related chlorine release, a leak release, and various other system or facility failure scenarios.\n\nThe chlorinator system is connected to a valve in the vapor space of the chlorine container.  Chlorine gas passes from the supply container through a vacuum ( negative pressure ) regulating valve.  Should the system vacuum be lost, due either to a shutdown of the water flow or a break in the chlorine supply line, the vacuum regulator at the tank outlet closes, isolating the chlorine supply container and preventing a gaseous release.\n\nDuring normal operation the maxiumum chlorine supply is two full ton containers, with one empty container awaiting retrieval by the chlorine supplier.  The chlorine room is equipped with a hoist for lifting and movement of the chlorine ton containers.\n\nThe Canyon Filtration Plant chlorine room is equipped with a chlorine leak detetor and an exhaust blower which is controlled automatically from outside the room.  In the event of a chlorine leak, the leak detector will activate an alarm light and horn in the plant control "
