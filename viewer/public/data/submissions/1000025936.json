              "Description": "The chlorine process at the Dodge Pumping Station is a system used to inject chlorine into raw water for the purpose of disinfection. The chlorine building is a separate building from that of the main pumping station building. One ton chlorine containers, are located in the chlorine building. Two containers are fitted with gas regulators, which are attached by vacuum lines to an automatic switch-over. From the switch-over, the vacuum line runs approx. 200 feet under ground to the main pump building. The chlorine gas is then injected into a 30 inch raw water transmission line via the automatic chlorine controller. Ammonium Sulfate in solution is pumped into the raw water transmission line just prior to the point of chlorine injection; this forms chloramines used as a disinfection. The average gas flow is approx. 50 pounds per day. The system is designed to shut down if there is a vacuum leak in the system or if there is a gas leak detection.",

      "SummaryText": "The Southwest Water Authority (SWA) is a political subdivision of the North Dakota State Water Commission established for the purpose of supplying water to the southwest region of North Dakota. The SWA delivers an estimated 4.5 million gallons of treated water per day to its customers. This figure continues to rise as the SWA expands serving a larger area and also due to the recent oil activity in our area. Because of the amount of chlorine stored and used in the water treatment process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and also at our Dodge Pumping Station (DPS), we as management / operators are required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA under 40 CFR Part 68-Chemical Accident Pervention Provisions ruling. Up to four chlorine containers (8,000 lbs.) are stored at each location. The amount of chlorine used at the WTP is an approximate average of 130 pounds per day and the amount used at the DPS is an approximate average of 50 pounds per day. The SWA is in compliance with the EPA's Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA). Each year since the reporting year of 1992, the SWA has submitted to the state and local emergency response authorities, documentation of the hazardous chemicals used and stored at both our locations. All treatment operators employed with the SWA are trained in chlorine safety and are well versed in the operational aspects of the chlorine / ammonia disinfection process. On-going training sessions for chlorine safety as well as other safety training is and will be conducted on a regular basis. All operators engaged in the maintenance of the chlorine process equipment are well informed as to the equipment mechanics, calibration and testing. The RMP is well received and is an important part of the safety program for the SWA. The SWA has a company written emergency response plan and the RMP is used in conjunction with this plan. The SWA has an excellent chlorine accident history. Our records show that there has never been a chlorine related "
