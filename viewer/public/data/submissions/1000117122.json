The terminal also adheres to various PSM-related corporate standards which hold the terminal to high standards. \n\n  \nDescription Of Harvest Midstream Alliance Belle Chasse Terminal and The Regulated Substances Handled \n  \nIn November 2021, Phillips 66 announced the closure of the Alliance Refinery and the transition of this facility into a crude oil terminal.  Harvest Midstream\u0092s acquisition of the Alliance Belle Chasse Terminal closed  on February 28, 2023.  This facility sits on approximately 3,200 acres, has 1 million barrels of active storage capacity and two loading docks. The terminal is located in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River, is about 25 miles south of New Orleans and 63 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nThe previous owner  (Phillips 66) developed and implemented its process safety management (PSM) program in the early 1990's, in response to the Occupational Safety Health Administration's (OSHA's) promulgation of the regulations contained in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery submitted the last RMP on December 6, 2021.  After the transition to a crude oil terminal, Phillips 66 submitted a Facility De-Registration Request to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on May 27, 2022.  \n   \nThe Harvest Alliance Belle Chasse Terminal is subject to the RMP rule due to the presence of flammable mixtures that contain the following regulated flammable chemicals: methane, ethane, propane, butane, butene, pentane, isobutane, isopentane, pentene, and 2,2-Dimethylpropane.  There are no toxic chemicals in quantities above the RMP threshold amount. \n  \n DISCUSS WORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE WORST CASE \n\nThe General Acciden"

This information is readily accessible to all personnel. This allows for the safe operation and maintenance of the terminal. \n  \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - PHA's are performed or updated for each PSM covered process at least every 5 years. All recommendations are tracked to closure. PHAs are also performed during the design stage before a significant change is \nmade to a process, and any recommendations are resolved before implementing the change. \n  \nOperating Procedures - Alliance Belle Chasse Terminal has written operating procedures that address different modes of operation (normal operations, start-up, shutdown, and emergency) at the terminal and serve as a reference for experienced personnel and a training tool for new employees. All procedures are certified annually. \n  \nTraining - The terminal has an extensive on-going training program that addresses both training for new employees and refresher training for all operators. Employees are not allowed to work independently until they have demonstrated adequate knowledge in a process, and records are kept on each employee's progress. \n  \nContractors - Contract workers at the terminal follow the same safety procedures as Harvest employees.
