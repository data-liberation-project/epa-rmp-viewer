If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Win-Bur-Sew Fire Protection District and the Winnebago County Emergency Services Disaster Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service. Medical emergencies will require notification of Rock River Emergency Medical Services (critical care provided by REACT transport helicopter). The primary hospital response is provided through Rockford Memorial Hospital (also the nearest Level 1 Trauma Center). The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Rockford Terminal Butane Blending System is a refined product storage and truck distribution facility, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the gasoline load rack). The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including two horizontal storage vessels, the associated piping, one injection skid, two sample analyzers along with gasoline fast loops, and one truck offloading point.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios were evaluated and communicated to the Win-Bur-Sew Fire Protection District.  Additionally, the local Emergency Response Action Plan was updated to reflect the addition of butane.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Rockford Terminal Butane Blending System complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of "

The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\n\n\n\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety. Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles.\n\n"
