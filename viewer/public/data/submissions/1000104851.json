This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, ExxonMobil modified its safety programs by adopting a concept of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS).  Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS (most recently in 2010) and evaluated it against the international standards for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) and Occupational Health and Safety Managements Systems (OHSAS 18001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, Lloyd's concluded that ExxonMobil's OIMS is consistent with the intent and meets the requirements of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  We further believe ExxonMobil to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental, occupational health & safety management considerations have been integrated into its business processes for ongoing operations and for the planning and development of new projects.\r\n\r\nAnother example of ExxonMobil's commitment was establishing a hydrofluoric (HF) acid steering group to coordinate the release prevention and emergency response efforts of its HF alkylation units worldwide.  The group established best practices for the operation and maintenance of the units and led efforts for a consistent approach to HF acid release response through enhanced detection and automatic i"

ExxonMobil Billings Refinery also follows API 751, an industry standard for HF alkylation units.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Refinery, located near Billings, Montana, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia (>20%), hydrofluoric (HF) acid and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.  Even though anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are present in amounts less than the RMP threshold quantities, we treat them in the same way by applying the accidental release prevention and the emergency response programs.  For the purpose of the Risk Management Plan, ExxonMobil Billings Refinery considered all covered processes to be Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery.  EPA's Program Level 3 prevention requirements were implemented because some processes at the refinery meet Program Level 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, ExxonMobil Corporation has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at each of its operations worldwide that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program and this summary describes OIMS.  Further, as already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 as valid management systems to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\r\n\r\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this Risk Management Plan.

Consequently, most of the reviews / updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Company of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.

This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  Some mitigation options, though, may involve process modifications that can only be implemented during a complete downtime of the covered process.  Implementation of such modifications therefore may extend well into the future and are subject to change.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.

In addition, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information and therefore, is controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
