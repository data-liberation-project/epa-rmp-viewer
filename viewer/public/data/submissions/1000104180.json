      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nBrenntag produces chemicals for the purification of public waters in the Southwest. To maintain good relations with the community it serves, Brenntag has established policies, procedures, and systems to prevent negative impacts from its chemicals. Here's a quick summary of these measures. \nBrenntag Houston Facility is located on approximately 54 acres on Haden Road about 0.5 miles off of Interstate 10 just inside of Beltway 8 on the east side of Houston, TX. The Brenntag - Houston Chemical Complex employs 50 hourly plant personnel and 23 administrative employees at the site. \nThe process areas in the facility are Alum, Bauxite, Chlor Alkali, and Specialty Chemicals. \nThe Alum area is the production area for aluminum sulfate (alum) loading and blending, HCL handling, and ACH/PAC manufacturing. It also handles blending of several water treatment products. It also handles loading and packaging of sulfuric acid products. \nThe Bauxite area is responsible for the manufacture of the base aluminum sulfate material utilized in the Alum/Aqualum area products. \nThe Chlor Alkali area is the production area for sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and repackaging of chlorine from 90-ton rail cars to 2000-pound containers and 150 pound cylinders. It also handles loading and packaging of caustic and KOH products.\n Blending and repackaging of various chemical products is the activity that takes place at Specialty Chemicals.\n Other facilities located on the property include an administrative building, truck terminal building, guardhouse, maintenance shop, laboratory, and change house. \nBrenntag is a MARSEC facility and complies with the site Facility Security Plan on file with the Coast Guard (DHS). Brenntag adheres to the TWIC card policy as set for by the Department of Homeland Security and ensures proper site security 24 hours per day. All Brenntag employees must be TWIC certified and all visitors/contractors/vendors are subjected to vigorous standards for plant access."

      "SummaryText": "Brenntag repackages chlorine and utilizes it for Sodium Hypochlorite bleach manufacture at the Houston facility. The chlorine arrives on site via rail car and is off loaded at one rail spot. Brenntag maintains an inventory of full rail cars (10-15 depending on the season) but only utilizes one railcar (180,000 lbs) for manufacturing purposes at any given point. Sulfur Dioxide cylinders (150 lb.) are warehoused and distributed from the Houston facility. Brenntag maintains an inventory of no more than 100 cylinders at any given time. Brenntag does not manufacture Sulfur Dioxide. \nThe handling of chlorine in the Houston Facility gives the potential of effecting the outside community. This is the chemical which is the driving force behind the policies, procedures, and systems which govern the operation of the entire Brenntag facility. Under OSHA 29CFR1910.119 (Process Safety Management) Brenntag developed a manual that helps prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic release of chlorine. Brenntag operators receive 40-hour Hazwoper training in addition to prescribed \"hands on\" training topics throughout the calendar year. This level of training allows us to respond to facility incidents which may occur. This level of training coupled with an active involvement by all employees to identify needed change is invaluable to maintaining a safe and reliable facility. Other aspects of the PSM such as Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Pre-Start up Reviews, Process Hazard Analysis are all rigorously followed, reviewed, and updated to ensure optimum safety and compliance with PSM/RPM regulations. \nBrenntag Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is reviewed and update annually. The ERP is divided into sections ranging from administration, policies, duties, chemical information, notifications, evacuations, drills and communications. Brenntag conducts plant wide drills quarterly and participates in drills the facilities located on"

      "SummaryText": "Haden Road. Other participants in the Haden Road drill include Office of Emergency Management, Sheriff's Department, and ESD-12 Fire Department. \nCommunications is an important tool in an effective response or mitigation process. At Brenntag, any level of chlorine above 0.5 ppm will shut the entire process down. At this action level a plant wide alarm sounds informing all operations of a chlorine release. If a problem exists, operations personnel secure their process areas and proceed to the response team assembly area. \nBrenntag has continued to be vigilant in the area of accident prevention and accidental releases as our five year history will show no reportable incidents during this time frame."
