These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, and the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nTwin City Foods is located at 1315 Sherman Street in Lake Odessa, Michigan. The refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n\n\nThe facility's two systems use a total of 38,511 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for warehousing and distribution of food and related products and services.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Twin City Foods ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, Twin City Foods operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that kills power to engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on t"

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nTwin City Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed in April 10, 2007, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Twin City Foods facility located at 1541 W. 27th Street. The Twin City Foods safety committee has completed several items, including the recommendations, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These chan"
