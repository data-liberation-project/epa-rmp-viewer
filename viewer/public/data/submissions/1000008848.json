      "SummaryText": "Harford County Government owns and operates the Abingdon Water Treatment Plant located at 3340 Abingdon Road in Abingdon, MD.  This facility is designed to provide up to 10 million gallons per day of drinking water to the citizens of Harford County.  The water source is surface water from either the Susquehanna River or Loch Raven Resevoir.  Chlorine, delivered, stored and fed from one ton containers, is used for disinfection of finished drinking water in compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Harford County has established an accidental release prevention program to include Process Safety Management, Risk Management Plan, Emergency Response Plan and most recently a vulnerability assessment.  All employees are trained in all aspects of safe handling and working procedures to include Hazardous materials Operations training tailored to the sapecific equipment and Personal Protective Equipment utilized at this facility.  All contractors are required to be trained in and adhere to Harford County established training, safety and PPE requirements.  The County's strict adherence to established safety training and Personal Protective Equipment requirements have resulted in an excellent safety record with no reportable incidents.  Harford County's commitment to the safety of its employees and citizens is a continuous effort.  The County is constantly looking for ways to limit employee and public exposure to toxic substances from their facilities and continues to pursue technological and training advances to assure continued success of this program."
