This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternative release duration assumed is 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes. No passive or active mitigation is considered in this scenario.

      "SummaryText": "ank was originally designed to store anhydrous ammonia, Arkalon determined that the maximum volume of aqueous ammonia that could be stored in this tank is 13,705 gallons. For this worst-case scenario, it assumed that a catastrophic failure of the tank resulted in the release of 102,378 pounds, which equivalent to the maximum tank capacity of 13,705 gallons, using the specific gravity for 26\u00b0 Baume aqueous ammonia, as stated on the Safety Data Sheet (SDS). A determination spreadsheet is included as part of this documentation detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of aqueous ammonia. Since the toxic chemical is not stored in a diked area, no passive mitigation is assumed in the endpoint calculation. As required by the rule, it was assumed that the spill spreads out until a depth of one (1) centimeter (0.39 inch), and assuming the spill occurs onto a flat, not-absorbing surface. Since a release would likely be onto, in part, a somewhat porous surface (soil), the distance estimated may be overestimated. Guidance provided by EPA\u2019s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (March 2009) indicated that a ten (10) minute release rate for aqueous ammonia, a neutrally buoyant substance in both rural and urban environments was appropriate. RMP*Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (2.7-mile radius); the model results are also provided as part of this documentation. The highest daily maximum temperature (40 CFR 68.25(d)(2)) from the previous three (3) years was provided by the Midwestern Regional Climate Center cli-MATE application. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS), which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, businesses, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth.

The endpoint used was an over pressurization     of 1.0 pound per square inch (psi), a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations \u2013 therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP*Comp was used to determine the alternative distance to endpoint (0.1 miles); the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, businesses, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility\u2019s knowledge of nearby residences.

Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.  Denaturant is stored in a 200,000-gallon aboveground steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. No passive mitigation was assumed to contain a worst-case release. The facility\u2019s natural gasoline (denaturant) SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 1,146,750 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (0.8 miles); the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, businesses, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility\u2019s knowledge of nearby residences. A worst-case release would likely travel to the northeast, where it would be contained within natural topography inside the facility boundary."

Arkalon Ethanol, LLC is permitted to manufacture up to 121 million gallons of ethanol per year. The anniversary date of the most recent resubmission of the RMP was November 21, 2017.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\nArkalon has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nArkalon has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nArkalon\u2019s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for Arkalon is Richard Hanson, Plant Manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The facility EH&S Manager also assists the Plant Manager with RMP and spill response coordination:\n\nChris Chaffin, EHS Manager\nWork: 620.276.4719\n24-Hour: 620.417.4822\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Arkalon ethanol plant is located in Liberal,"
