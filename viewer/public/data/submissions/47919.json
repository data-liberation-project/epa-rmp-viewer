The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from wet natural gas that is gathered and compressed from gas producers in the area.  The Plant consists of refrigeration and treating processing trains and compressors driven by internal combustion engines.  Once at the plant, the incoming natural gas is sent through a separation and refrigeration process and then through an amine treating process to remove carbon dioxide gas.  The treated gas is then compressed to pipeline pressure and dehydrated through a Triethylene Glycol dehydration process.  The residue gas leaves the facility via pipeline while the remaining natural gas liquids (NGL's) are stored in a series of pressurized bullet tanks.  The NGLs leave the plant via tank trucks.  As a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the Plant at any one time.  Although there are plans to add additional processing trains and equipment, the actual inventory within the Plant should not change significantly.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RE"

      "SummaryText": "LEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Anderson Gulch Gas Plant.  The Anderson Gulch Gas Plant has been classified as a Program 1 because no public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.  The processes at the gas plant are regulated by OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  \n\n1)  EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\n2)  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on an ongoing basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n3)  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitig"

All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4)  OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n1. Unit startup\n2. Normal operations\n3. Temporary operations\n4. Emergency shutdown\n5. Normal shutdown\n6. Initial startup of a new process\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the Anderson Gulch Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper or lower limits.  This information along with operating procedures is readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perfo"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years and can be satisfied through the review and certification of operating procedures.  All of the training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n6)  CONTRACTORS\n\nThe Anderson Gulch Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n5.
