Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with HUNTSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilities primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), and Formaldehyde. The Sulfur Dioxide, Formaldehyde and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Formaldehyde are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 82,745 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is present at our facility at levels below 10,985 lbs.\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed record of w"
