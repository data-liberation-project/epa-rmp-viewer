      "SummaryText": "EcoElectrica, L. P. Pe?uelas Power Plant and LNG Terminal (EcoElectrica) owns and will operate a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) marine unloading and storage terminal and a 507 MW combined cycle power plant. The facility is located in the Municipality of Pe?uelas, Puerto Rico. The intent of the facility is to provide the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) with additional electric power.  The LNG stored at the terminal will be vaporized to form natural gas which will be combusted in the power plant combustion turbines.  Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) will be an alternate fuel and low sulfur distillate oil will serve as an emergency backup fuel if LNG or LPG are not available.   The power plant consists of a combined cycle generating module which includes two combustion turbines/generators exhausting into separate heat recovery steam generators (HRSG's).  The HRSG's produce steam that will be routed to a steam turbine /generator and to a desalination plant capable of producing fresh water from sea water.  Other facility processes are a closed cooling water system, a demineralization plant and a remineralization plant to produce potable water for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) systems for Pe?uelas and Guayanilla. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nEcoElectrica will use anhydrous ammonia for the control of NOx emissions generated during combustion processes.  Ammonia will be stored within EcoElectrica premises.  For the potable water system, EcoElectrica will use and store chlorine onsite.  EcoElectrica has the capacity to store chlorine and ammonia (anhydrous) over the RMP threshold quantities (2,500 lb and 10,000lb respectively).\n\nEcoElectrica is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the RMP rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This determination has been made on the following basis:\n\n* As determined in the off-site consequence analysis for chlorine and ammonia, public receptors are within the circle with its center at the point of the release a"

A maximum of 75,158 pounds of ammonia will be stored at the facility at any given time.\n\nChlorine will be stored at the facility in a ton container.  A maximum of 2,000 pounds of chlorine will be stored at the facility at any given time, but EcoElectrica has the capacity to store 17 1-ton containers of chlorine.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Ammonia  \n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for ammonia is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank, over a period of ten (10) minutes, due to a tank rupture . The largest amount of ammonia in the tank at any given time is 75,158 pounds. The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.  \n\nThe analysis for ammonia was made taking into consideration the topography, which was determined to be rural and any passive mitigation, such as dikes or enclosures. EcoElectrica does not have these types of mitigation systems for the ammonia storage area.\n\nThe maximum distance to the endpoint was determined to be 4.9 miles using the RMP CompTM Program.

This is based on 1990 Census data obtained from the LandView(R) III program. \n\nThe \"alternative release scenario\" for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of ammonia through a safety valve that due to overpressure of the 2inch internal diameter pipe used to fill the anhydrous ammonia container, releases anhydrous ammonia for a period of 10 minutes, over rural topography. The topography determination was based on the few buildings and other obstructions (e.g., trees) in the area where the ammonia process is located. The maximum distance to the endpoint was determined to be 0.5 miles using the RMP Compa Program.  This scenario is based on an assumed wind speed of 3.0 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour), Class D stability, and an air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit at 50 percent relative humidity.  Appendix B contains the RMP Compa Program summary for this scenario.\n\nThe estimated population contained within this circle is 140 persons.  This is based on 1990 Census data obtained from the LandViewa III program and U.S.G.S. Maps.  A complete summary of the LandViewa III data is contained in Appendix C.
