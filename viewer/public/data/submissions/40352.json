      "SummaryText": "The Turner Road Vintners West Facility (TRV-WF) is located at 5852 West Turner Road, Lodi, California and is operated by Canandaigua Wine, which is owned by Constellation Brands, Inc. Construction of this facility began in 1998 and was completed in 1999.  It is designed as a wine grape processing and wine production facility. All process and operations conducted at the facility are integral parts of the winemaking and distribution.\n\nCanandaigua Wine maintains a commitment to worker and public safety as evidenced by the resources invested in accident prevention and in the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the West facility.  Canandaigua Wine maintains a proactive stance, as a labor intensive agricultural based industry, Canandaigua Wine is dedicated to the protection of natural and human resources.\n\nCOVERED PROCESS:  REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Refrigeration system, which contains 36,000 lbs of ammonia, is a Risk Management Plan Program 3 (RMP).  This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of three (3) 400 hp FES S-Series screw compressors, and two (2) low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation systems. The compressors and high pressure receiver are located in a Machinery Room.  There are twelve (12) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine and two (2) shell & tube heat exchanger used for either direct cooling or heating of the wine. One of the low pressure recirculator\u00bfs serves the cooling jackets on twenty-four (24) storage and fermenting tanks.  The other low pressure recirculator serves the cooling jackets on eighteen (18) storage and fermenting tanks.  \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN/PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT\n\nIn addition to being regulated by 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and 19 CCR 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program, the TRV-WF is regulated by Title 8 CCR 5189 Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM).

The main elements of the program are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nEmployee Participation includes involvement in the process hazard analysis, development and review of operating procedures, process safety information, and mechanical integrity inspections.  \n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been conducted on the existing system and the new expansion.  The PHA methodology was a What If/Checklist based on the Uniform Mechanical Code, ANSI/IIAR 2 1999, IIAR Bulletin 110 and the Compressed Gas Association.  The PHA is revalidated every 5 years.\n\nAnnual certification is performed for the process safety information and operating procedures.  Training on operating procedures and mechanical integrity is provided to affected employees.  All employees are trained in Hazard Communication and the Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The PSM/RMP program also has procedures for Hot Work, Contractors, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review.\n\nAnnual inspections are conducted for Storm Water Pollution Prevention compliance, Hazardous Materials Inventory Reporting, and Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting requirements. All programs and policies are designed for compliance with applicable environmental and safety regulations including Title 8 CCR General Industry Safety Orders. Some of the additional programs and policies that are currently in place:\n\n\u00bfInjury and Illness Prevention Program\n\u00bfRespiratory Protection\n\u00bfHazard Communication\n\u00bfConfined Space Entry\n\u00bfControl of Hazardous Energy\n\u00bfAccident Investigation\n\u00bfStorm Water Pollution Prevention\n\u00bfHazardous Materials Management Plan\n\u00bfToxic Chemical Release Program\n\u00bfAnnual Safety Day\n\nSafety meetings are held regularly by Department Managers and all employees are provided with initial training and annual refresher training in all necessary safety programs."

      "SummaryText": "FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred within the last five years at Turner Road Vintners West Facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIt is the goal of Canandaigua Wine to be self-sufficient in responding to the control and containment of hazardous materials or other emergencies. Canandaigua recognizes that inadequately trained and equipped personnel can result in an injury. For this reason the emergency response program will utilize a combination of response strategies. On-site personnel are trained first in awareness and self-protection, and then in specific control and containment procedures. Reporting and communications with emergency response agencies is entailed in the program. An ongoing commitment to joint participation exercises with local emergency responders is a key element of the program.\n\nThe emergency action plan (EAP) for Turner Road Vintners lists the responsibilities of the employees, the Operations Department Management Staff and the General Manager during an emergency situation. The EAP discusses medical emergencies, fires, earthquakes, flood, electrical power failure and hazardous materials releases. There is an emergency release reporting form for the release of hazardous materials. The General Manager or Incident Commander (IC) is in charge of notification and reporting with public agencies. An emergency notification roster lists all public agencies for emergency notification. A list of Turner Road residents and their phone numbers are included for emergency notification.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nUpgrades in technology, automated process controls, new standards and methods are reviewed and considered for implementation as part of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). In addition to the PHA, planned changes to improve safety are evaluated as a result of RMP/PSM compliance audits."
