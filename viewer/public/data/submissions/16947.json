Accidential release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility we package aerosols, using propane, isopropane, butane and DME, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in handling these propellants.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and solvents, combined with the safety devices inherent in our facility.  We are continually updating our training of our personnel and insuring safe handling procedures are developed and used.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the NPGA'LP-Gas Safety Handbook and Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, police, federal, state, hospital, emergency response personnel and any potentially affected neighborhoods.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to package aerosol products using flammable propellants and solvents.  They are received at the facility in tankers and in drums.  The (bulk) material is stored in 3 propellant tanks, 6 flammable solvent storage tanks and the drums are stored in our flammable drum storage room.  Fencing to authorized employees, contractors and management personnel restricts access to the site.\n\nThe maximum amount of flammable propellant, 3 bulk tanks, that can be stored at this facility is 23,000 gallons.  At this time, only two propellant tanks are in use and this will lower the amount stored to 18,565 gallons.\n\nThe maximum amount of flammable solvents, 6 bulk tanks in addition to drums and totes, that can be stored at this facility is 19,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nThe worse-case scenario is the complete lose of the largest propel"

Since the vapor cloud formed from this rupture is considered to form a explosive cloud, the local authorities are required to evacuate the populace for at least 0.30 miles down wind of the tank rupture.  The alternative release scenario, is considered to be a fill line disconnected from the tank body.  This again will be similiar to the worse-case scenario.  The tanks are surrounded by a protective I-beam guard rail to prevent accidential impact by all types of vehicles.  The tanks are also equiped with flow control valves to prevent excessive loss of material from the tank in the event of line breakage other then at the tank wall.  Gas sniffers are used to trip alarms to notify personnel of high levels of vapor in the filling gas house.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nControls are in place when the propellant tanks are being filled by the highly trained delivery driver.  Procedures developed by the propane indusrty are strictly enforced by the driver.  General accidental release is limited to the time the tanks are in the filling process.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history.\n\nNone to report.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nThe emergency response program is in place as per the RCRA Emergency/Contingency Plan requirements.  In the event of a hazardouse event, the local-state-federal authorities are notified as needed.  The local hospital will also be notified if required.  The Detroit Water & Sewerage Department will also be notified if material has entered the drain system.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAt this time all regulatory requirements are being reviewed for accuracy.  Telephone numbers are to be checked for correct area codes.  A new-updated Safety Plan is presently in process and approval.  A new Hazmat Survey is in process for the local Fire Department.  A new Spill Plan has been develop"
