      "SummaryText": "1.    Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Actagro, LLC, Biola plant facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 4516 N. Howard, Biola, CA, 93606 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged fertilizers to our customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in one above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 16,800 Gallons or 86,000 pounds.  The ammonia is stored in two tanks that are of equal size and are always equalized to hold the same quantities.\n\n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and alternative Release Scenario\n    The worst-case release scenario is failure of both storage tanks when filled to 60% percent capacity for each tank for a total of 16,800 gallons.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.10 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or most likely potential incident) is a release from a 1.5-inch line.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .48 miles.\n\n4.    Accidental release Prevention Program\n\n    Anhydrous Ammonia: The facility has implemented the provisions of the A?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1A?, published by the American Nati"

Five Year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, or regulated products in the past five years that:\n    Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe following is a list of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated products in the past five years that have occurred at the facility: None\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facilityA?s emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia process at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n"
