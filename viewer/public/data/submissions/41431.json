      "SummaryText": "The City of Neosho's Crowder WWTP  is a 3 MGD Wastewater treatment facility for the City of Neosho.  Chlorine gas is used for disinfection of the treated wastewater.  This presents the risk of chlorine gas release.  The plant complies with all State EPCRA regulations.  The chlorination equipment was updated in 1988 to an all vacuum operated system, which is the safest type available.  The chlorine system is used intermittently between March and October.  Between times of operation, tank main valves are shut and tanks are out of service.  In the past 5 years there have been no chlorine release accidents at the plant.  In a worst case scenario, if the total contents of a 1 ton cylinder (2000 lbs.) were to be released in 10 minutes with a wind speed of 3.5 mph, the toxic endpoint would be 2.2 miles from the plant.  In an alternative scenario, if a release was for 60 minutes at a rate of 10.5 pounds per minute and wind speed at 6.7 mph, the toxic endpoint would be .1 miles from the plant.  Operators have been trained in emergency response to a chlorine release.  We also work closely with the Newton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Neosho City Fire Department in the event of any chlorine release.  Emergencies will be handled in accordance with the Newton County Emergency Operations Plan."
