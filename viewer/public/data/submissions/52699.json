      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nChesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. owns and operates a natural gas processing site, the Daube Ranch Compressor Station, in Johnston County, Oklahoma. The station is designed to process natural gas, during which liquid products are recovered from natural gas. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for offsite sales.\n\nThe Daube Ranch Compressor Station has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Daube Ranch Compressor Station is located near Gene Autry, Oklahoma and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Daube Ranch Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion involving 293,548 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in the product tank. Using the EPA OCA Guidance Equations, the entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.54 miles. The WCS will affect two public receptors. A consideration of the 0.54 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning. \n\nChesapeake's management is committed to the following:\n-Preventing accidents;\n-Training"

Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community. \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Daube Ranch Compressor Station is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of the flammable mixture from a 2? hole at the bottom of the Product Tank (9,900 lb/min).  The release is expected to be isolated by operations personnel within 15 minutes or by automated station shutdown system to shutdown all engines, station utilities and actuated valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the flare. The resulting vapor cloud explosion reaches the 1 psi overpressure point at 0.43 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nChesapeake encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n2. Performing necessary calculations for RMP\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n4. Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\nEmployees have access to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nChesapeake keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These technical documents address the following:\n1. Chemical properties "

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\nChemical ?specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in material safety data sheet (MSDS). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operators? procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nChesapeake has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process. This program systematically examines for potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted with a team of Chesapeake employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The team?s findings are forward to Chesapeake?s Management for resolution. The approve"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nChesapeake maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary.\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nTraining\n\nChesapeake has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.
