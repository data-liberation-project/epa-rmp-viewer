ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE WILL BE RECORDED AND REPORTED TO THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND E.P.A.  ANY PEOPLE WHO COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE RELEASE, WILL BE NOTIFIED.  THE LOCAL RESPONSE AGENCY WILL BE CONTACTED TO SECURE ANY SPILL AND TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER PROBLEMS. IF NECESSARY, THE PERSONNEL AT THE FACILITY WILL RESPOND TO EMERGENCY ROUTES AND WILL HELP ANY CUSTOMERS TO ESCAPE, USING THE SAME ROUTE.         \n\n2  FACILITY AND SUBSTANCE\n CRAMER AGRI CENTER                  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n3.WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE-CASE\nIF THE FULL NH3 STORAGE TANK WOULD EMPTY BECAUSE OF A RUPTURED PIPE, THE 18,000 GALLONS OR 83,000# OF PRODUCT WOULD HAVE AN ENDPOINT OF .56 MILES. THERE ARE 24 RESIDENTS LIVING WITHIN THIS AREA.\nIF A TRANSFER HOSE FAILED, 12,000# OF PRODUCT WOULD BE RELEASED, IF IT TOOK TWO MINUTES TO STOP THE LEAKAGE.  AGAIN, THE ENDPOINT IS .56 MILES AND INCLUDES A POPULATION OF 24.\n\n4.GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nTO PREVENT A RELEASE, I CHECK HOSES AND PIPING AROUND THE RISER AND TRANSFER PUMP EVERY DAY OF OPERATION. ALSO, WHILE I AM FILLING TANKS, I WALK AROUND EACH TANK I AM FILLING TO CHECK THINGS LIKE THE TANK HOSE, HOLD-DOWN BOLTS, TIRES, AND VALVES. I CHOCK THE WHEELS OF THE TANK THAT IS FILLING AS WELL AS TURN-OFF THE ENGINE OF TRUCK THAT MIGHT BE CONNECTED TO THAT TANK.  HOSES AND RELEASE VALVES ARE CHANGED, ACCORDING TO THE DATES ON THE EQUIPMENT, OR IF THEY ARE DAMAGED AND/OR LEAKING. I AM THE ONLY EMPLOYEE WHO IS TRAINED AT MY FACILITY, SO I DO ALL THE TRANSFERING, DELIVERIES, AND REPAIRS.\n\n5.RELEASES\nI HAVE NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AT MY FACILITY. \n\n6.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nMY PROGRAM INCLUDES NOTIFYING THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, REMOVAL OF ALL PERSONNEL IN THE SPILL AREA, NOTIFYING THE EPA AGENCY AND THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.\n\n7.AT THE PRESENT TIME, I HAVE NO PLANNED CHANGES"
