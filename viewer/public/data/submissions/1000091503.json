The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Petsource employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be met by using good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Petsource owned activities.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Petsource facility is a refrigeration cold storage facility. The refrigeration system is used for cooling and freezing capabilities required for the processing and storing of petfood products. The cooling medium for refrigeration at this site is anhydrous ammonia (subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68) consisting of 32,000 lbs. which is used in a closed loop recirculating and recycling system.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n* Employee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n* Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia SDS and a detailed description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.

Based upon potential hazards identified, recommendations have been developed to improve the safety of the system.\n\n* Operating Procedures: Written, detailed standard and emergency procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees who operate the system are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* Contractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices and all standard and emergency operating procedures.\n\n* Pre-Start-up Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed for their effect on the system as a whole.\n\n* Management of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\n*Incident Investigation: Procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, review, and documented using and investigation team. Any recommendations are resolved to improve the safety of the facility.\n\n* Compliance Audits: Audits will be conducted at least every three years as mandated by OSHA Standard 29 CFR Part 119.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPetsource has not had a release of ammonia from the Petsource facility that has affected the public or the environment.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an incident requiring off-site response, the Petsource First Responder at the Awareness Level will notify the Seward Fire Department a"

The Plant Emergency Coordinator with cooperation from the Evacuation Coordinator and the Headcount Coordinator will evacuate all employees to the assigned evacuation area, perform a head count of everyone on-site, and wait further instructions from the Incident Commander for the Seward Fire Department. Upon site arrival, the Seward Fire Department will assume Incident Command and will contact the HAZMAT Team for assistance and designate individuals to proceed with off-site evacuation of the immediate facility and surrounding community(s) if necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPetsource completes a thorough review of the ammonia system each time a design change is implemented. Petsource is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems.\n\n"
