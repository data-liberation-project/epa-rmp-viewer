This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical integrity inspection, process control systems and by recognition of occupational and process safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. \n\nTo prevent accidental releases, Solar Gas achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n- A commitment to OSHA's Process Safety Management and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's RMP, and the Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulations, which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n- Development and use of Hess Corporation and Solar Gas operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n- Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized and generally accepted good \nengineering practices  (RAGAGEP), specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction and operation of facilities containing hazardous materials.\n- A comprehensive equipment inspection and testing program.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nSolar Gas has one regulated flammable, propane.  Propane is delivered to the facility by rail.  The product is stored in above ground bullet tanks or an underground cavern. If propane is transferred from rail to bullet tanks, and then loaded on trucks, no water removal process is required. Propane stored in the cavern is processed to remove water before loading into trucks. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nProcesses at Solar Gas that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management"

Solar Gas  adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the past five years, Solar Gas had one accidental release as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nSolar Gas maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved. The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. The emergency response program includes elements required to be within the facility response plan for the alternative release scenario. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSolar Gas conducts ongoing efforts to reduce risk through the Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management. These include recommendations from process hazards analyses, employee suggestions, incident investigations, compliance audits and a review of the preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity programs."
