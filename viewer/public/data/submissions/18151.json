There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA  Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provied to the local emergency planning committee for coordinaiton in the community response planning.\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."

      "SummaryText": "1.  The Faculity Policy: The owners, management, and emplyees of Studer Fertilizer Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidential releaces of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular maintaince and inspections and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidential releace occur, the faculity has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for any releace and minimize the impact of the releace to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved,stored, and distributed for direct applicaion as a crop nutrient and also used for blending in a mixing operation to make mixed-grade fertilizers for application. The maximun quantity stored would be 183,396 in the facility's 3 tanks. The capacities of each of these tanks are, 140196, 21,600, 21600 pounds.\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank (tanks) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maxiumum quantity released would be 183396 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures (or if applicable the quantity in rail car if greater).  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.16 miles.\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 11908 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.16 miles.\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSIK61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 19"
