Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAmerican Products recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Dallas facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden  resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Ronnie Waldrop,  Maintenance \nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the "

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAmerican Products is owned by Best Brands,  LLC. The Dallas facility is a  bakery and distribution center. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 14,500 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regu\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of 5,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the # 4 ammonia condenser.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel .9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n         Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the condenser; \n         Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n         Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the vessel;\n         The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels; \n         The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; \n\nThe alternative release scenario at the facility involves the release of 1140 pounds of ammonia over a 30 minute period through a defective pressure safety valve (PSV) on the"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n         Employee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n         Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist  Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety. \n\n         Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Training: A t"
