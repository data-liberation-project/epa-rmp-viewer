The safety department also conducts incident investigations to determine the events and causal factors of each incident with the goal to improve safety and prevent reoccurrences.  A Behavior Based Safety program is also in place at Atlas Point to encourage all employees to recognize and encourage safe practices. \n\n\n\nCroda has made safety performance a priority at the Atlas Point facility.  We have partnered with OSHA in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) a voluntary program for worksites that show excellence in occupational safety and health. This shows Croda's commitment to effective employee protection beyond the requirements of OSHA standards. As a VPP STAR Worksite, Croda has developed and implemented systems to identify, evaluate, prevent, and control occupational hazards to prevent employee injuries and illnesses. \n\n\n\nThe Croda Atlas Point site also has a Community Advisory Council, which meets quarterly to foster communication with our neighbors and answer questions of concern.  Participants include the Delaware State Police, the Delaware Bridge and River Authority, a local school district, local businesses and government agencies, as well as local community organizations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Croda Atlas Point site produces hundreds of products that provide desired chemical properties for household cleaning products, personal care products, and industrial applications.  The site contains ten different processing units designed to provide the range of chemical specialties required.  Raw Materials are received in railcars, tank trucks and drums.  Products are shipped out in tank trucks or drums.  Several of the processing units convert EO or PO to desired products.  EO and PO are toxic chemicals regulated under RMP.\n\n\n\nIn 2018 a new processing unit came on-line to produce EO from ethanol.  Previously, EO was received in railca"

The ability to convert ethanol to EO will substantially reduce the amount of EO railcars stored on-site, replaced by ethanol a less hazardous material that does not need to be regulated under RMP.  The process of converting ethanol to EO consists of converting ethanol to ethylene and then ethylene to EO.  Ethylene is a flammable material regulated under RMP.  There is no storage of ethylene on-site; it is consumed as it is produced in the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Prevention Program 3 specified in 40 CFR 68.65 to 68.87. The components include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor work.  The Atlas Point site is also regulated under the OSHA PSM standard 1910.119 for the toxic and flammable materials on-site.\n\n\n\nAtlas Point uses expert industry consultants to advice on compliance with industry standards from NFPA, ANSI, API, ISA and others. \n\n\n\nSome of the safety features in use, categorized as passive or active mitigation systems include the following.\n\n\n\n- A network of 90 combustible gas sensors located strategically to detect leaks or loss of containment. Leak detection by the sensors will automatically trigger a staged response, starting with an alarm and progressing to firewater deluge, depending on the extent of the leak.\n\n\n\n- Ethylene oxide gas sensors worn by personnel in the process areas.  These sensors alarm if ppm levels of ethylene oxide are detected, allowing personnel to respond prior to exposure to harmful concentrations.  They also provide an early warning if there are leaks.\n\n\n\n- A remote emergency retention area (or spill sump) lo"

The spill sump confines the chemical and is equipped with a water spray system to dilute and contain the spill, thereby reducing the amount released to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n- A diked area surrounds the storage tanks.  The diked area captures spills and directs the liquid to the spill sump by gravity.  The remote location collects leaks of flammable liquid away from process equipment to prevent the spread of fire. Preventing the accumulation of flammable liquids under the storage tank greatly reduces the risk of a storage tank BLEVE.  \n\n\n\n- A water deluge system is installed to quench fires and absorb leaks of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.  It is designed based upon the National Fire Protection (NFPA) standards.\n\n\n\n- All of the chemical processing units have computer control and monitoring.  These systems monitor key parameters such as temperature and pressure and will automatically control the system within safe operating parameters. A redundant interlock system (Safety Instrumented System), independent of the computer control system, is in place to monitor and set the process to a safe state if critical conditions are encountered and the computer control system does not respond.\n\n \n\n- Alarms are wired and controlled through the computer control system and sound an audible alarm as well as a visual flag.

The stack insures that the concentrations at the ground level would be less than OSHA's Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) levels. The modeling used to design the stack included scenarios provided by DNREC and incorporated worst case scenario features.\n\nIn addition, Croda performs a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) inspection twice annually, which will detect small leaks and repair them before they become a hazard. \n\n\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOn November 25, 2018 the ethanol-to-EO unit released 2688 pounds of EO over a four hour period.  The release occurred because of an incorrect gasket that was installed at the EO Purification Column. This gasket was of the wrong material; it degraded and broke apart after three months service allowing a leak path out of the equipment.  To prevent off-site toxic exposure the Delaware Memorial Bridge was closed for the duration of the release.  There were no hazardous levels of EO measured off-site.  Employees were wearing personal EO sensors to warn of EO exposure.  \n\n\n\nOne employee who went to the hospital emergency room to be checked for symptoms of exposure was admitted to the hospital for a 72-hour observation period.  The 72-hour observation period was based on potential of delayed onset of symptoms as described in CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.  The employee was released and returned to work with no limitations.  No other on-site or off-site consequences were found.\n\n\n\nChanges were introduced as a result of the accident.\n\n\n\n- Improved/ upgraded equipment: the unsuitable gasket was replaced with the correct gasket.

Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Croda accidental release prevention program includes the components of EPA's RMP Emergency Response section, specified in 40 CFR 68.90 to 68.95.\n\n\n\nCroda maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that describes the site's emergency response program. The local community emergency response organization, Holloway Terrace Fire Department, and the New Castle County Local Emergency Planning Council (LEPC) have received a copy of the ICP and have included it in the community emergency response plan.\n\n \n\nIt is Croda's policy to respond in an efficient and effective manner to any emergency that occurs at the Croda Atlas Point site. Croda personnel regularly prepare for emergencies by conducting emergency drills that have included the local fire department.  A group of Croda employees have been trained to act as emergency responders and/or incident commanders.  Croda emergency personnel can be reached 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe ICP includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n\n\n\n- Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures.\n\n\n\n- Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.
