The facility is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Facility operations include painting and sandblasting, railcar interior cleaning, an organic scrubber system, an ammonia flare for venting cars containing ammonia, and a flare for venting flammable gases.  Before a tank car is cleaned, any remaining contents in the car must be removed.  These processes, specifically the venting operations, involve the use of the following regulated toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantity:\n\n7 Ammonia \t7 1,3 Butadiene\t7 Chlorine\n7 Butane\t7 Butene\t7 Isopentane\n7 1 Butene\t7 2 Butene\t7 2 Methyl 1 butene\n7 2 Butene cis\t7 2 Butene trans\t7 3 Methyl 1 butene\n7 Isobutane\t7 Isoprene\t7 2 Methylproprene\n7 Propane\t7 Propylene\t7 Nitric Acid\n7 Hydrochloric Acid\t7 Pentane\t7 1 Pentene\n7 1,3 Pentadiene\t7 2 Pentene (E)\t7 2Pentene (Z)\n7 Dimethylamine\t7 Ethlyamine\t7 Oleum\n7 Methylamine\t7 Trimethylamine\t\n\nGATC also transports in its railcar fleet other commodities which it does not process, has never processed, and does not intend to begin processing, at the facility, but which are included on the regulated toxic substances list for accidental release prevention.  GATC has established administrative controls to prevent these commodities from arriving at the facility.  Nonetheless, the regulation still requires preparation of worst case and alternate release scenarios for these commodities.  Based upon engineering judgement and process knowledge, the alternate release scenarios for these substances were assumed equal to the worst-case release scenario.  These substances are as follows:\n\n7 Bromine\t7 Carbon Disulfide\t7 Chloroform\n7 Ethyl Chloride\t7 Allyl Alcohol\t7 Formaldehyde\n7 Ethylene Oxide\t7"

GATC has established administrative controls to prevent cars from arriving at the Facility carrying the following commodities in excess of the TQ:\n\n7 Acetaldehyde\t7 Methyl Ether\t7 Propylene Oxide\n7 Vinyl Acetate Monomer\t7 Vinyl Chloride\t7 Ethyl Ether\n7 Acrylonitrile\t7 Epichlorohydrin\t7 Ethylenediamine\n\nIt is noted that GATC has applied for a Title V Operating Permit, but the permit number had not been issued as of this writing. \n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nGATC is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with relevant  regulations and good operating practices.  These operating practices strive to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the rail car cleaning process.  If an accidental release were to occur, GATC has response measures in place to minimize the release impact.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS \n\nThe worst-case release scenario incorporated the following:\n\n7 At the time of this writing, GATC used the latest available version of USEPA's RMP*Comp software to estimate distances to the toxic and flammable (1 psi overpressure due to an explosion) endpoints for the 59 substances listed above. \n\n7 For the worst-case release, GATC analyzed 59 regulated substances.

Closing both of these valves within 5 minutes introduces a 50 percent spill mitigation control factor. \n\nPentane Alternate Release Scenario\n\nA likely alternate scenario is that the hose connected to the flare ruptures and the remaining pentane vapor escapes through the rupture. The release duration is assumed to be 5 minutes.  No mitigation measures are in place.  \n\nAdditional Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nAll other alternate releases consider the potential release of  the regulated substance due to a leaking valve. This scenario assumes that the release occurs over a 15-minute period, and no active mitigation systems are in place.\n\nThe toxic and flammable endpoints do go offsite for the alternate release scenarios.  Active mitigation measures were considered, where applicable.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn December 1995, GATC performed a hazard and operability (HAZOP) process hazard analysis (PHA) in order to identify potential hazards at the facility.  GATC has several process controls in use such as relief valves, check valves, flares, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms, and procedures in the event of a release.  Additionally, a hose inspection and replacement policy is in place to further minimize the likelihood of a release.\n\nGATC has developed a set of operating procedures contained in the GATC Car Cleaning Procedures Manual.  The Manual documents procedures for acceptance, inspection and sampling of incoming railcars, and provides the documentation for operating the rail car cleaning system.

The Manual documents procedures for acceptance, inspection and sampling of incoming railcars, and provides the documentation for operation of the rail car cleaning system.  These procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  GATC has developed a training plan to attempt to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.  Up to date and accurate instruction and continued employee training procedures will aid in future facility safety."
