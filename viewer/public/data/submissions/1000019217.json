      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nThe Gallup Wastewater Treatment Plant (GWWTP) in Gallup, New Mexico is the City of Gallup\u00c2\u00bfs only wastewater treatment plant, currently serving over 22,000 people in the area.  The GWWTP receives, treats and releases wastewater from residential, commercial and industrial sources.  The facility stores and uses only two regulated chemicals, anhydrous chlorine and sulfur dioxide, in quantities higher than the threshold quantities.  The terms anhydrous chlorine and chlorine are used interchangeably and specifically refer to a chemical listed in the RMProgram regulations.\n\nThe chlorine is used in the chlorination process to disinfect wastewater.  Chlorine is stored within a building in three 1-ton containers and up to five, 150-pound cylinders.  The total maximum intended inventory is 6,750 pounds.  The chlorine is liquified under pressure in the containers.  Chlorine is drawn as a gas from the 1-ton containers through a vacuum feed system.  The gaseous chlorine is then metered into a solution through two chlorinators.  The chlorine solution is then fed to various chlorine feed points.  The sulfur dioxide is used in the dechlorination process in which sulfur dioxide reacts with water and hypochlorous acid created by the chlorination process.  The hypochlorous acid must be removed from the wastewater prior to discharging the effluent into the Puerco River because hypochlorous acid has detrimental effects on aquatic life.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in the dechlorination storage building in 12, 150-pound cylinders.  The maximum intended inventory of sulfur dioxide is 1,800 pounds.  The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and therefore, the chlorination and dechlorination processes are subject to the Program 3 RMProgram Regulations.\n\nMinimizing Risk\nThe major driving force in the development of the RMProgram regulations is reducing the risk to public health by minimizi"

      "SummaryText": "ng the potential of a chemical release.  The GWWTP has a multi-layer system in place to meet this goal.  The RMProgram includes the following: (1) properly trained operators to safely handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide; (2) leak detectors located where chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored and/or used; and (3) chemical release prevention and emergency response plans in place.  Trained personnel respond to alarms to assess whether a release poses an imminent danger to employees or the public.  While a significant release is unlikely, the emergency response plans have been developed for just such an occurrence.  The emergency response plans include procedures to be followed by operators trained to take appropriate action including contacting the City of Gallup Fire Department and New Mexico State Police.\n\nManagement System\nWithin the management and administrative roles of the GWWTP, responsibility has been defined to coordinate and implement the RMProgram.  Overall development and management of the RMProgram is the responsibility of the RMProgram Manager.  The Project Manager is the designated RMProgram Manager.\n\n5-Year Accident History\nAny accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage must be reported in the RMProgram submission to EPA.  Based upon interviews with plant operations, maintenance, safety, and training staff and management, no major chemical release has occurred at the GWWTP in the last five years.\n\nChemical Release Prevention Program\nThe GWWTP has a chemical release prevention program in place for the use chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the facility\u00c2\u00bfs chlorination and dechlorination processes, respectively.  Key provisions of the prevention program are as follows:\n\nWritten procedures have been prepared for the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, including directions for sa"

Employee competancy is evaluated annually by the project manager, regional safety manager or other member of STES management.  \n\nIncidences, including minor releases are investigated to improve the safety of the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  \n\nOnce completed, incident investigations are shared with employees.\n\nA process hazard analysis, which identifies potential hazards and ways to improve the safety of the chlorination and dechlorination processes, is conducted every five years, or when significant changes are made to the process.\n\nA maintenance program is in place to prevent accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  Maintenance practices are consistent with guidance provided by the Chlorine Institute and Compressed Gas Association. Prevenative maintenance schedules are directed through the use of a computerized maintenance management system.\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every three years to evaluate the RMProgram and its implementation for compliance with EPA RMProgram regulations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe GWWTP has an emergency response program in place.  This program consists of personnel trained to recognize releases, assess the situation, and engage the proper emergency response personnel.  When external emergency response is required, GWWTP personnel will notify the City of Gallup Fire Department and/or New Mexico State Police then establish an incident command system.  Incident command is transferred to the Fire Department or the New Mexico State Police upon their arrival.  GWWTP personnel familiar with the chlorination and dechlorination processes remain on-site to assist the emergency response agencies if necessary.  The Fire"
