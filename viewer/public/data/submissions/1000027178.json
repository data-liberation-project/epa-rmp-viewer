The covered process at the Terminal is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as  the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following summary addresses the combined elements of these three programs and describes the activities surrounding the implementation of each element. These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Owosso Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Code (NFPA-58 [2011]) requirements for LP-Gas storage. In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, a Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Owosso Township Fire Department and Shiawassee County, MI LEPC.\n\n\n\n1. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Owosso Terminal involves employees in the programs developed to support process safety management and accident prevention. Employees are included in every element of the program, from development, to active participation, to program updates. They are members of the process hazard analysis (PHA) team, the compliance audit team and make up the safety and emergency response teams. They implement the mechanical integrity, operator training and contractor safety programs. Employees have access to information created as part of this accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n2. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled and is made available to all facility personnel. This may be done by physical records and internal computer-based records. PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to "

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units. Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel.\n\n\n\n4. Standard Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten standard operating procedures are developed and implemented. The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical team, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if an upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\n5. EHS Operator Training\n\n\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the facility are provided with comprehensive initial training and periodic refresher training.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Owosso Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. This is a \"new\" butane blending process; consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Owosso Township Fire Department .  A Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, and Sara Title III. The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required. Our Discharge Prevention, Containment and Countermeasure Plan (DPCC) and Facility Response Plan (FRP) provide the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Contained in these Plans are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur at the terminal. These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions. Th"

This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, flame retardant clothing and first aid equipment. An inspection, testing and maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment. Fire extinguishers are inspected monthly and receive annual maintenance per the international fire code. Inspection reports for emergency response equipment are filed onsite.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Owosso Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Owosso Township Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire capability. The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Owosso Township Fire Department and LEPC. The Owosso Township Fire Department also maintains a full hazardous material response team, is aware of the Facility's butane blending system access and sources. Sunoco Logistics-Owosso Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the system.\n\n\n\nWe also maintain a relationship with the Owosso Township Fire Department. Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely. These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the terminal.\n\n\n\nE.
