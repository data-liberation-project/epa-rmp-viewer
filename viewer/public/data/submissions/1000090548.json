This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations,  industry standards and practices, process safety policies and guidelines developed by Marathon Petroleum Company.  Exaqmples of resource materials are Marathon Refinery Standard Practices and Health and Safety Standards. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery is located at 474 West 900 North in Salt Lake City, UT.  The refinery is owned by Tesoro Petroleum Corporation. The refinery processes 63,000 barrels of crude oil per day in a variety of processes to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG),  etc.  The refinery has five(5) processes that contain materials above the threshold quantity and are,therefore, covered by the RMP rule. These processes are all classified as Program level 3 processes. All covered processes contain  regulated flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The flammable mixtures typically contain  various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. One process contains a Toxic substance (H2S) above threshold quantities which is hydrogen sulfide.\n\n\n\n HAZARD ASSESSME"

It was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (TK-329 BB Feed Sphere) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. ALOHA&trade; was used to calculate a distance of 0.5 miles to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint resulting in a VCE. The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effect of the WCS.  Based on the distances to the endpoint, calculated using the ALOHA model, effects from the WCS would reach offsite.\n\n\n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS):\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a release of flammable liquid isobutane from a isobutane sphere.  The distance to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the ALOHA modeling, would reach offsite. This release scenario was selected based on industry history, and because it is a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Details concerning the ARS analysis have been provided to the EPA. \n\n\n\nToxic Worst Case Scenario (WCS):\n\nThe Tesoro Salt Lake City Refinery worst-case scenario for toxics assumed that the Amine Regenerator Tower, E-205, located in the Sulfur Recovery Unit, experienced a catastrophic failure resulting in the complete release of the entire contents of the tower. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm H2S was 2.7 miles.\n\n\n\nToxic Alternative Release Scenario (ARS):\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, it was assumed that the Sour Water Stripper, E-231, located in the Sulfur Recovery Unit, experienced a failure resulting in a release of hydrogen sulfide from the stripper The distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm H2S was 2.4 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nFollowing is a summary of "

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Examples of these are the Joint Health and Safety Committee, STEPP Steering Committee, and the Refinery Process Safety Committee.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Asset divisions within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table sum"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table and in Standard Operating Instructions.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Salt Lake City Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and tracked.  Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and their final resolution is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operat"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them in accordance with the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the Salt Lake City Refinery maintains a Safe Operating Limit Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nFor the written procedures for process operations, the Salt Lake City Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
