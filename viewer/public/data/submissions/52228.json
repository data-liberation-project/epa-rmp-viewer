      "SummaryText": "RMP Facility and Regulated Substances\nZep Inc is a leading producer of retail and commercial cleaning products.  The Zep Inc ? Seaboard Plant is comprised of numerous small manufacturing units.  These units include a 1.) liquid cleaning product unit, 2.) handcare product unit, 3.) solvent product unit, 4.)  acidic cleaning product unit, and 5.) aerosol production unit.  The Aerosol Plant uses non-odorized propane and isobutene in three different mixture concentrations to serve as propellant for aerosol can products.  The propellant is injected into the cans in an enclosed gashouse.  Both propane (CAS # 74-98-6) and isobutane (CAS# 75-28-5) are regulated under EPA?s Risk Management Program rules.   Propane is additionally regulated under OSHA?s Process Safety Management rules.  These propellants are generally described as LPG (liquefied propane gas) mixtures and are hazardous due to flammability.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention\nIn order to insure proper operation of the Aerosol Plant and to prevent undesirable releases of LPG, operating procedures and employee training have been developed.  The efficacy of this training and procedures is checked at least every three years by the conduct of detailed 3rd party audits. A Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA) is likewise conducted periodically to assess the LPG process for potential safety improvements.  Additionally, a battery of preventative maintenance (PM) tasks are completed regularly to insure proper mechanical operation of the LPG system.  Finally, mechanical integrity is assessed periodically including annual checks for LPG leaks using EPA Method 21.  \n\nSpecific Accidental Release Prevention Systems \nSeveral systems are in place to detect and respond to an LPG leak or fire.  These systems include:\n1.Fire water sprinkler system serving the (3) LPG tanks\n2.A gas leak detection system with visual and audible alarm response serving the aerosol plant can filling area\n3.A halon deluge system in the gashouse \n\nEmergen"

This equipment includes leak detection monitors and fire-fighting equipment.  Trained incident commanders lead any response to an accidental release.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nWhile a few noteworthy accidental releases have occurred within the past 5-years, no such release has resulted in a fire, property damage, loss of life, or triggered an evacuation among Zep?s neighbors.  Fugitive leaks from filling or process equipment have occasionally been found and are subsequently repaired on a timely basis.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAlthough no specific infrastructural or process changes or improvements are planned, incremental improvements to the PSM/RMP program are on going, especially driven by periodic compliance audits and PHA?s.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        Alternate Emergency Contacts\nGerald McKie, Safety Engineer, ofc 404-603-7681, cell 404-593-7308\nDavid Apgar, Director of HSE, ofc 404-603-7771, cell 817-797-1638\nDavid Korn, VP-Chief Compliance Officer, ofc 404-605-8702, cell 404-931-3742"
