      "SummaryText": "The Town of Gilbert North Water treatment plant is a 45 Million Gallon a day municipal water treatment facility.  Chlorine Gas is used for disinfection of the finished municipal water supply. For normal operations, four one-ton containers are positioned on a separate set of trundle racks adjacent to the storage racks, and are connected to the chlorination system. Chlorine is supplied to four chlorinator units from two one-ton containers via a vacuum transfer system. In addition to the  four one-ton tanks that are on line the chlorine building houses twelve 1- ton cylinders on trundle racks  as backup supplies for empty cylinder change outs. As many as 18 one-ton containers can be stored in this building. \r\nThe chlorine storage area is completely enclosed there is a 3000 (cfm) fan that maintains negative pressure on the chlorine building 24/7 operation. There is a chlorine sensor in the intake vent to the air-flow fan that upon sensing chlorine at 0.5ppm shuts off the air-flow fan and starts the Chlorine scrubber system. The wet scrubber system utilizes Rayon grade caustic soda (NaOH) to scrub the chlorine concentration and exhaust to atmosphere.\r\nThe Town of Gilbert is proactive in maintenance of the chlorination process equipment as well as the safety equipment. In compliance to OSHA's Process Safety Management standard - 29 CFR 1910. 119, we perform weekly, monthly, quarterly & annual preventive maintenance on all critical components. All operations staff receives training on operating procedures through in-house instruction and review of the plant's operations and maintenance manual. The Gilbert facility provides annual refresher courses and trainings with respect to chlorine handling and safety (OSHA standards 29 CFR 1910.) and review with our Chlorine distributors. The chlorinator equipment manufacturer representatives witness bi-annual preventive maintenance of the chlorinator lines & headers during which the system is hot power washed and nitrogen dried as pa"

      "SummaryText": "rt of our system audits.\r\nThe facility has not had an accidental release from the covered process in the seventeen years it has been in service (1996). The facility is secured from public access, entrance gates to plant are kept closed. Only plant staff and select Administrators have security badge access and visitors must call via intercom from gate to have gate opened and is directed to front office to sign in and get a visitor pass. The Gilbert plant is staffed by at least two water treatment plant operators at all times 24/7.\r\nIn the event of an un-manageable or catastrophic release of chlorine, the Town of Gilbert Fire Department will fulfill the role of first responders.  Upon detection of an un-manageable chlorine leak, the water treatment plant operations staff will dial 911 to implement emergency procedures.  The Town's Fire Department will implement the Town's EOC and community notification procedures as necessary.  Operations staff will implement the facilities emergency evacuation procedures to assure all personnel and visitors on-site are evacuated and accounted for.  Any unaccounted for individuals will be reported to the first responders.  Once in a safe location, operations staff will notify the Town's upper management of the situation.  The water treatment plant staff currently works proactively with the Gilbert Fire Department to perform routine walk through tours of the facility to assure responding crews have a basic understanding and familiarity of the site and equipment.  The Fire Department Hazmat team is planning to perform future coordinated full dress drills on site using a simulated leak from a 1-ton chlorine cylinder. Water treatment staff holds routine leak drills to test sensors & alarms and exercise the facilities emergency response plan and evacuation procedures."
