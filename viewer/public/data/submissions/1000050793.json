Olympia Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Olympia Foods' policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur.
