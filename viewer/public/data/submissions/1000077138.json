Davis Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Austin, Texas and operated by Austin Water Utility. The location of the facility is 3500 West 35th Street, Austin, Texas 78703 in Travis County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act 112(r). The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 74,000 pounds of chlorine in thirty-seven (37) one ton cylinders. The facility utilizes 10 cylinders in-service and 8 cylinders stand-by with automatic transfer as the cylinders become empty. Once the cylinders are empty the lines are disconnected and connected to full containers. The facility maintains 19 cylinders in storage and orders chlorine, as necessary, for delivery of new cylinders and removal of empty cylinders. The facility also stores anhydrous ammonia which is a covered process under the Risk Management Program. The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 20,600 pounds of ammonia in two (2) 2000 gallon cylinders. The cylinders are filled, through piping from a truck delivering the ammonia as needed. Procedures require that the cylinders are filled to 85% capacity. \r\n\r\nThe facility has not had a release event associated with either covered process involving chlorine or ammonia. The facility is equipped with several mitigation systems and process controls to respond to an emergency in the event of system failure.\r\n\r\nThe Albert R. Davis Water Treatment Plant maintains a Risk Management Plan containing all of the elements required for a program 2 facility under the Clean Air Act section 112(r) regulations. The plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the potential hazard zone under both the Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios. These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each s"
