Davis Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Austin, Texas and operated by Austin Water Utility. The location of the facility is 3500 West 35th Street, Austin, Texas 78703 in Travis County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act 112(r). The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 74,000 pounds of chlorine in thirty-seven (37) one ton cylinders. The facility utilizes 10 cylinders \"in-service\" and 8 cylinders \"stand-by\" with automatic transfer as the cylinders become empty. Once the cylinders are empty the lines are disconnected and connected to full containers. The facility maintains 19 cylinders in storage and orders chlorine, as necessary, for delivery of new cylinders and removal of empty cylinders. The facility also stores anhydrous ammonia which is a covered process under the Risk Management Program. The facility has the potential to store a maximum of 20,600 pounds of ammonia in two (2) 2000 gallon cylinders. The cylinders are filled, through piping from a truck delivering the ammonia as needed. Procedures require that the cylinders are filled to 85% capacity. \n\n\n\nThe facility has not had a release event associated with either covered process involving chlorine or ammonia. The facility is equipped with several mitigation systems and process controls to respond to an emergency in the event of system failure.\n\n\n\nThe Albert R. Davis Water Treatment Plant maintains a Risk Management Plan containing all of the elements required for a program 2 facility under the Clean Air Act section 112(r) regulations. The plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the potential hazard zone under both the Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios.

Public receptors are impacted under the scenarios; however, there are no environmental receptors. \n\n\n\nAustin Water Utility (AWU) takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine and/or ammonia gases that could affect their employees, nearby businesses, and the public. The facility operates under a current Risk Management Plan which details both the dangers associated with using chlorine and ammonia and the precautions implemented to ensure the safe use of chlorine and ammonia in the chlorination process of treating water for public consumption. Precautions include routine inspection of the equipment, proper stock of emergency response and personal protection equipment, and training of facility personnel on proper operating and emergency response procedures. The most probable type of release may occur when there is a transfer hose failure in the chlorine or ammonia lines. AWU has trained a number of workers who know how to use emergency equipment, self-contained breathing apparatus and other personal protective equipment to repair such leaks. AWU keeps a \"B\" kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on operational leaks. The RMP includes current standard operating procedures for preventative maintenance on the chlorination system. \n\n\n\nAny Emergency Response is to be done in conjunction with the Austin Fire Department. All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the likely types of leaks are available on site. Further, AWU personnel audit the facility to maintain the integrity of emergency equipment, communication systems and the training status of its employees.
