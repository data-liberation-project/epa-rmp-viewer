      "SummaryText": "Harcros acquired this facility and its employees from Lynx Chemical Group in July 2007.  This facility is located on a 27-acre site which manufactures and distributes chemicals.  There are three chemicals above the reportable threshold: anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, epichlorohydrin.   As part of Harcros' continuous improvement process, the aqua ammonia tanks at the Dalton facility are in the process of being upgraded and replaced.  The new tanks also increase Harcros storage capacity of aqua ammonia which is the reason for this change.  An additional RMP covered process was discontinued in 2015, which used phosphorus trichloride, a toxic chemical. Harcros has a long-standing commitment to safety and protection of the environment where we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.   We are proud not to have an RMP reportable incident in the last 5-years.   As a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors we adhere to the principals of Responsible Distribution and are committed to continuous improvement.\n\n The facility has safety features built into the design of the facility that help to ensure safe operations for our employees, the public and the environment.  These features include but not limited to secondary containment, pressure relief valves, isolation valves, manual shutdown systems, system alarms and warning systems.  Since acquiring the facility in 2007 Harcros has made continuous improvements to the processes including but not limited to: upgrading the toxic gas alarm warning system, installation of a new process control system, installation of a new anhydrous ammonia storage tank, improvements to site security, and a recent installation of foam based sprinkler system in the warehouse.  Harcros also conducts internal audits, process hazards analysis, pre-startup safety reviews, contractor safety reviews, and change management to ensure we are continually improving our process.\n\nIn ad"

      "SummaryText": "dition to preventing incidents, Harcros has a robust Emergency Action Plan to mitigate the consequence to the environment, public, and our employees in the case of a hazardous chemical release.  This plan has been coordinated with local emergency responders and includes periodic meetings with responders so they are aware of the hazards of our processes.  Coordination and communication channels ensure the public is quickly notified, if necessary, and actions are promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release.  We periodically conduct emergency drills so all participants are familiar with their duties during an emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
