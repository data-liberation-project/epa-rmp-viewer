Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of AgVantage FS, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Waukon Fire Department, Allamakee Co. Emergency or other authorities, to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 1719 Prarie Ave NW Waukon, Iowa is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. This site is used primarly as a parking area for a number of anhydrous wagons. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
