There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period at the plants.\n\n\n\nTo comply with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), the initial step was to develop a prevention program as required by the RMP and by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. An RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was developed for of the three plant sites. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n?    Written site-specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self-Audits\n\n?    Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n\n\nNext, these additional steps were implemented to bring the PSM program to full compliance:\n\n?    Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\n?    Conducting Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine processes\n\n?    Developing Standard Operating Procedures for safe Chlorine Management\n\n?    Developing a Maintenance Program for the chlorine systems\n\n?    Developing an Emergency Response Plan\n\n?    Training in support of the certification of operators\n\n\n\nThe superintendent, chief operators and several plant operators meet several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/RMP regulation.\n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of Chlorine.\n\n\n\n?    The chlorine delivery system at each of the three plants was designed to use a vacuum process. This process has proven to significantly improve chlorine safety by placing all of the cylinder system under vacuum. Any leak will result in air leaking into the system as compared to chlorine escaping the system.\n\n?    The"

      "SummaryText": " chlorine emergency response plan has been upgraded at all plants. The services of a regional hazardous material response team have been obtained to response to all chlorine incidences.\n\nTo further understand chlorine risks, SK Environment and Engineering PLLC conducted \"Offsite Consequence\" Modeling Analysis, as required by EPA's Risk Management Program. Both \"Worst Case\" and \"Alternative Case\" chlorine release scenarios were studied for each site.\n\n\n\nThe simulation results showed the risk of chlorine exposure varies depending on the plant's location:\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1040 Coble Ave Ext., in Albemarle NC, approximately 2.2 miles south of the Albemarle city center. The plant is located in a low-lying area adjacent to the banks of Long Creek, which is approximately 375 feet west and 15 feet topographically downgradient from the plant. The plant's elevation is 415 feet above mean sea level. The closest public receptors are located to the south of the plant and are situated in areas that are topographically upgradient from the chlorine storage areas. Chlorine is a heavier-than-air gas and tends to flow downhill towards low-lying areas. In a little-to-no wind situation at the plant, a chlorine release would tend to flow eastward down to the creek, then remain in low areas until dissipated but the trailer homes to the south could be significantly impacted.\n\nThe Tuckertown Water Treatment Plant is located at 36576 Highway 49, approximately 10 miles north of the Albemarle city center. The plant is located approximately 1,500 feet west of the Tuckertown Reservoir, which is an impounded section of the Yadkin River. The plant's elevation is approximately 80 feet above the elevation of the reservoir. Chlorine is a heavier-than-air gas, and as such tends to naturally flow downhill towards low-lying areas. The land areas to the west, north and south are topographically upgradient from the plant, creating a natural berm effect, and creating a defined "

Thus, in a little-to-no wind situation or for winds from the northwest, west, southwest, a chlorine release would tend to flow to the reservoir area, where it will initially be contained at the tree-lined shore and then remain in or around the lake until dissipated.\n\nThe Hwy 52 Water Treatment Plant is located at 2510 Highway 52 North, approximately 3.3 miles north of the city center.  The plant is located to the east and topographically upgradient from Highway 52. Since chlorine is a heavier-than-air gas, except in the case of a very strong wind from the west, any chlorine release will tend to flow westward down toward the highway. To the east is a small, circular, man-made reservoir whose elevation is slightly higher than the plant. Little Long Creek is located approximately 2,500 feet east and 145 feet topographically downgradient from the plant. If a chlorine release were to occur during a period of winds from the west, the release would be blown toward the creek into low populated areas. If a release were to occur during low winds the gas would flow down slope towards Highway 52 and the homes and businesses adjacent to the highway or towards the residences to the south of the plant.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Albemarle has had an active Safety Committee.  The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site. The committee's duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nWithin the Utilities Department, there are monthly safety meetings conducted by each plant. There is a review on an OSHA subject or a discussion on a specific water or wastewater safety issue.\n\n\n\nThe Utilities safety program involves the following activities:\n\n?    Conducting ac"
