The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system located at Cold Storage Solutions 230 Kenneth Welch Drive, Lakeville, MA.  It is owned and operated by Cold Storage Solutions Inc.  The only Risk Management Program regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as a toxic substance, liquified under pressure.  \r\n\r\nThis facility is a cold storage warehouse/food distribution facility.  The refrigeration system in this facility has an inventory of approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored on site in two separate ammonia refrigeration systems.  System 1 is 8,000 lbs and System 2 is 7,000 lbs.  This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  Thus, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to meet the EPA Program 3 Level of Compliance.\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Program Manual has been developed by HCG Associates on behalf of Cold Storage Solutions, Inc. specifically to prevent or mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the Cold Storage Solutions facility. As noted in specific sections, portions of this Plan, including technical details associated with anhydrous ammonia operations were prepared by American Refrigeration Company, Inc., of Andover, Massachusetts. This manual was developed to meet the requirements of the Risk Management Plan regulations and is available to government agencies and the public for review.\r\n\r\nCold Storage Solutions operates the 230 Kenneth Welch Drive facility on an approximately 13-acre indu"

The RMP also works concurrently with the OSHA Process Safety Management program under 29 CFR 1910.119.  CSS employees and management staff participate in both regulatory safety programs in order to maintain an accident free work environment.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nCold Storage Solutions has developed a comprehensive emergency response policy that was developed and meets established criteria.  The plan has been provided to the Local LEPC and Lakeville Fire Department.  Included within this program are coordinated annual emergency response drills with the Lakeville Fire Department, as well as internal evacuation and notification employee drills.  Employee training is focused on topics such as:  Ammonia Properties and Emergency Response, Respiratory Protection, Process Safety Management, Hot Works Program, Ammonia Detection Devices, Atmospheric Monitoring, CPR/First Aid, and Emergency Action Plan Implementation.\r\n\r\nProcess Overview\r\nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle.  Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized as a primary refrigerant, with the only substance within the system being Anhydrous Ammonia.  The process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid, repeating the process continuously.  The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammo"

The system then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure temperature and cools the gas until such time as it condenses.  The condensed liquid is pumped into a low pressure side of the system where the pressure is lowered and the cycle repeats itself.  The ammonia changes states form to a liquid-gas-liquid cycle.  Anhydrous Ammonia does not change chemically, and it is not consumed or released during the refrigeration cycle.  Ammonia continually recirculates throughout the system.\r\n\r\nManagement & Prevention Program\r\nCold Storage Solutions has developed a management system that will oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program.  This implementation will be overseen by the following team of employees:\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Parenteau will have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program.  Assistance for program supervision is provided by the Safety Director and the Facilities Maintenance Manager, with ultimate responsibility lying with the Facility Manager.\r\n\r\nScope & Commitment\r\nThe focus of the Management Program is on tracking, reporting, and documenting the operation and maintenance of the Ammonia refrigeration system.  This is required in order to insure a minimal risk to the community, provide a sphere of safety to the environment, our employees, and the facility.  Operations of the Cold Storage Solutions facility comply with all aspects of the Process Safety Management Program.\r\n\r\nCSS Management is committed to the implementation of the Risk Management Program and views it as a vital aspect and integrated part of daily operations.  CSS Management has provided the support and resources to insure the successful implementation of the identified procedures on an ongoing basis.
