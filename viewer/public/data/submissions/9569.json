In\n\nservice to the community, the Village has a history of adhering to proactive approaches for the\n\nprevention and emergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances.  Current\n\nprevention and emergency response polices adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's\n\n(EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR\n\n68 regulations.\n\n\n\n     The Facilities are located in Tequesta, Florida, and utilize chlorine gas in the disinfection\n\nprocess within their water treatment process.  The Facilities maintain an enclosed chlorination\n\narea and chlorination distribution system on-site.  Chlorine is delivered to a central area and\n\nstored on-site in cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure when\n\nfull. The chlorine facility holds a maximum of four (4) 2,000 pound cylinders.\n\n\n\n     The Facilities have an outstanding performance history in conjunction with handling,\n\nstoring, maintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have occurred since\n\nthe system went into service in 1973. The water treatment plant is manned 16 hours/day, seven\n\n(7) day/week, 365 days/year.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe\n\nhandling, maintenance and operation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68\n\nregulations.  The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the\n\nVillage's emergency response officials.  Operational staff are trained according to these response\n\nplans.\n\n\n\n     The EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios\n\nfor toxic substances identified as \"worst case"

      "SummaryText": " release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case\n\nrelease\" is defined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in\n\nthe largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA\n\nspecifies the parameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its \n\n\"toxic endpoint.\"  The alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case\n\nrelease scenario\", such as a pipe leak. \n\n\n\n     Utilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 3.5 miles was calculated for the\n\nworst case release toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.  As per EPA\n\nregulations, the population is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to\n\nthe toxic endpoints.  These population values are 32,663 for the worst case and 307 for the\n\nalternative release.  It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative\n\nrelease scenario, the population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being\n\nmore in the form of an elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a\n\ncircle centered on the point source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     The use of chlorination within water treatment systems has yielded enormous benefits in\n\nthis County related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.   The Village, like virtually\n\nevery modern treatment facility, understands the value and risks of this treatment procedure. The\n\nVillage has an exceptional track record of no accidental releases in its history and remains ever\n\nvigilant in its attention to safety regarding chlorine. The Village supports this regulatory effort to\n\ninform the public in the general vicinity of any utility of the risks associated with accidental\n\ngaseous releases.  Indeed, we support efforts to notify the public of such risks at all points of\n\nexposure including the production, delivery and site storage of chlorine gas.\n\n\n\n     If you have "
