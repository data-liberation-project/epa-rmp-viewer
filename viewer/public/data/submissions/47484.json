Accordingly, our goal is to experience zero injuries, accidents and incidents.  In order to meet this goal, we will commit any necessary resource and we empower each employee to use those resources.  One such resource is our extensive suite of safety procedures.  The core of these procedures is a combination of relevant regulations, industry standards, good engineering practices and best management practices.\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\n\n\nVanderbilt Chemical Corp. (VCC) is a specialty manufacturer of organic and organo-metallic lubricant additives, rubber accelerators, antioxidants, registered pesticide active ingredients and paint additives.  Many of our primary products belong to the dithiocarbamate family.  Some of the products are powders or pellets; others are mineral oil based concentrates or aqueous mixtures or slurries.  Co-products include aqueous solutions of sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4).\n\n\n\nThe primary liquid reactants include amines, diamines, carbon disulfide, mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, alcohol complexes of dithiophosphoric acid, isopropyl and other alcohols.  We store these materials in aboveground storage tanks (AST's), tank trucks, tank cars, totes and drums.  The majority of the AST's are located in the A31 Tank Farm in the eastern portion of the site.  We receive dry solid reactants in bulk \"super sacks\", fiber drums and paper sacks and store them primarily in the A72 Warehouse.  These materials include, but are not limited to, metal oxides (e.g., antimony, lead, molybdenum, zinc), oxidizers (e.g., ammonium persulfate), and various minor processing aids and additives.  Some of these materials are toxic; some are flammable; and some exhibit both toxic and flammable characteri"

The list of regulated substance includes 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances.  Vanderbilt's Murray, KY facility is one of these sources.  The RMP rule describes three categories of sources and establishes different requirements for each category.  The rule considers whether the source:\n\n1. has had an accidental release of a regulated substance with off-site consequences within the last five years,\n\n2. could have an accidental release of a regulated substance that could cause off-site consequences,\n\n3. falls into a specific type of industry and\n\n4. is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management rule2 (PSM).\n\nVanderbilt handles two regulated (toxic) substances in greater than threshold amounts and otherwise meets conditions 2, 3 and 4, therefore it is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Vanderbilt's Murray facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance that resulted in off-site consequences within the last five years.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule requires each affected stationary source to report its 5-year accident history and to determine the off-site consequences of a worst case release for each regulated substance that it handles above the threshold amount.  For releases of regulated toxic substances, the rule defines \"worst case\" as a release whose toxic endpoint reaches the greatest distance from the point of the release under standard weather conditions that do little to dissipate the vapor cloud.  The RMP rule defines a unique toxic end point for each regulated substance.  Worst case naturally occurs when the largest amount of the substance is spilled and the resulting pool has the largest possible surface area.  For releases of regulated flammable substances, the rule defines \"worst case\" as a release t"

The following table lists the RMP regulated substances that apply to Vanderbilt:\n\n\n\nCovered Regulated Substances \n\nRMP Substance\n\n\n\nCarbon disulfide (CS2)\n\nCASRN - 75-15-0\n\nThreshold Amount (lbs) - 20,000\n\nMaximum Amount (lbs) - 105,000\n\nStorage Location - Tank Car \n\n\n\nPiperidine\n\nCASRN - 110-89-4\n\nThreshold Amount (lbs) - 15,000\n\nMaximum Amount (lbs) - 93,150\n\nStorage Location - Tank 31-407-05 or Tank Truck\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nBetween June 1999 and June 2004, there were no accidents involving RMP substances that had off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nWeather Conditions\n\n\n\nAfter the properties of a substance, the amount released and the surface area of the spill are considered, the prevailing weather conditions are the next order of importance in calculating the consequences of a release.  The RMP rule establishes standard \"worst case\" weather conditions and requires each source to consider these conditions when modeling its worst-case releases.  In addition to being \"worst case\", these standard conditions assure that all sources evaluate their scenarios under the same conditions.  Facilities may use weather conditions that are appropriate for their location in their alternate scenarios.  We chose to use the average conditions as based on the closest National Weather Service station (i.e., Paducah, KY) for all alternate scenarios.  The \"worst case\" and the average conditions follow:\n\n\n\nParameter\n\nWorst Case Wind Speed - 1.50 m/sec\n\nAverage Wind Speed - 3.11 m/sec\n\nWind Direction - 180 degrees\n\nWorst Case Humidity - 50%\n\nAverage Wind Speed - 70%\n\nStabil"

The RMP rule sets a concentration of 160 mg/m3 in air to establish the toxic end point for CS2.  We receive this material in 10,000-gallon tank cars and transfer it to one of two 12,500-gallon AST's.  From here, we meter out relatively small amounts to vessels in the various process trains.  Nitrogen pressure is used to force the CS2 off the rail cars into our AST's.  Once in the AST's, we store it under water until it is combined with other ingredients and we transfer it into the process vessels using water pressure.  In addition, both AST's are located under water to ensure that any accidental release from a tank will be protected.  We have always used this simple, robust safeguard at Murray because it maximizes safety and eliminates evaporative losses to the air.  The operating permit issued by the Division for Air Quality of the Kentucky Environmental Protection Cabinet requires us to maintain this water cap at all times.  In addition to this safeguard, Vanderbilt takes other precautions when handling and storing CS2:\n\n1. using N2 pressure to unload eliminates mechanical pump seals;\n\n2. rail cars must not have bottom valves;\n\n3. all unloading is \"over-the-top\";\n\n4. all unloading connections are bolted (no quick-coupled hose connections);\n\n5. special unloading and handling instructions and training.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accident under the RMP rule is a spill of the entire contents of a tank car into the area around the rail siding at \"worst case\" weather conditions.  Such an accident would spill 10,000 gallons (105,000 pounds) of CS2 into an unlined stormwater ditch.  The resulting evaporating pool would have a surface area of about 5,600 square feet (i.e., 520 m2).  In this scenario, the toxic end point occurs 0.86 miles from the center of the release (see below).\n\n\n\nCarbo"

The Maintenance and Engineering Manager is responsible for a subset of the MOC that deals with equipment, including new equipment, revisions to existing equipment and systems, and maintenance of equipment.  The MOC procedure requires that all staff managers (safety, environmental, quality, etc.) and selected operations personnel review and approve all new and revised equipment, procedures or materials, and that all changes be communicated to each affected employee.\n\n\n\nEquipment Integrity - Design/Construction/Installation\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance and Engineering Manager is responsible for ensuring that the design, construction, installation and integrity of all facility equipment are suitable for the intended function and operating environment.  He is further responsible for ensuring that all equipment and its installation meet regulatory and industry standards (e.g., API, NFPA, NEMA, etc.).  Only equipment that meets all applicable requirements and is compatible with the materials to be stored or processed shall be chosen.  All storage and process equipment shall be installed inside secondary containment that is adequate to contain all spills (see below).  \n\n\n\nSecondary Containment Requirements\n\n\n\nSecondary containment means a man made structure whose purpose is to contain spills and releases from storage tanks and process areas.  Examples of secondary containment are:\n\n1. curbs, floor trenches in process areas,\n\n2. sumps, if they are reserved exclusively for spill containment,\n\n3. dikes or berms around storage tanks,\n\n4. gates on drainage ditches near remote unloading/loading areas.\n\n\n\nAll secondary containment constructed after the effective date of this plan shall:\n\n1. be made of concrete,\n\n2. sized to hold the v"

These berms will hold spilled materials long enough (e.g., at least 24 hours) to prevent runoff and to allow for recovery.\n\n\n\nConcrete dikes currently surround the three tanks adjacent to Process Area 21, one of the three fuel oil tanks, the Hydrogen Peroxide Tank and many of the process tanks in or adjacent to process areas (e.g., process and intermediate tanks immediately adjacent to the Area 10).\n\n\n\nConcrete floors and either concrete dikes or curbs and floor trenches, or both protect process areas, as well as specific storage tanks in process areas.  These engineered structures are intended to trap spills, aid in the recovery of spills and to prevent spilled materials from migrating into the environment long enough (e.g., at least 24 hours) to allow recovery.\n\n\n\nContainment structures of both types trap storm water.  This water must be inspected and sampled by a Utility Operator and tested by the on-site Laboratory before it may be discharged.  Stormwater release procedures are addressed in the written work instructions of the Utility Operator.\n\n\n\nFinally, spill control and clean-up supplies (e.g., sorbent clay, pads and booms) are maintained on site to control the types of spills discussed in the Hazard Assessment section.\n\n\n\nPreventive Maintenance (PM)\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance & Engineering manager is responsible for c"

The most common type is a visual observation and is made routinely by operating and maintenance personnel during the course of carrying out their daily duties.  In certain high-risk material transfers (e.g., carbon disulfide and hydrazine hydrate), we use only bolted fittings when unloading transportation vessels and we pressure check the piping system before each transfer.\n\n\n\nThe second is a simple visual inspection conducted periodically by engineering or other trained personnel.  For example, engineering staff might be assigned to inspect process equipment for signs of corrosion, cracks, etc.  For another example, Environmental Operators observe all major storage and operating equipment, dikes, etc. during a weekly \"RCRA\" inspection.\n\n\n\nThe third, and highest, degree of inspection is a detailed engineering assessment of tanks, vessels and structures.  These assessments are conducted by, or under the supervision, of a competent engineer knowledgeable in the field.  Such assessments include thickness measurements on storage tanks and the structural components of tanks and buildings.  The results of all assessments conducted on in-service equipment in recent year's leads us to believe that our tanks and structures are sound and fit for their present duty.  The Engineering Department has developed a written program formalizing these procedures.  In the case of the submerged CS2 tanks, the engineer conducting the assessment supervises specially trained commercial divers who use underwater instruments to collect physical data and cameras to document the condition of the tanks. Finally, we conduct tank tightness tests (c. annually) on Carbon Disulfide (CS2) storage tanks because they are not visually accessible as other AST's.\n\n\n\nAt this facility, all RMP regulated substances are raw materials.

Attention to these rules ensures that transportation equipment is both suitable for the purpose and sound.\n\n\n\nProcedures & Work Instructions\n\n\n\nOperation's management is responsible for drafting written work instructions and operating procedures to ensure quality, safety, pollution prevention and environmental compliance.  Each written procedure includes general spill and release response instructions.  All such instructions and procedures, including changes and revisions, are reviewed by staff functions, including Quality, Safety and Health, and Environmental Managers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\n\n\nEmployee Involvement\n\n\n\nWe do not have a formal, written employee involvement plan however, we do have a formal safety advisory committee made up of employees from all departments and we involve operations and maintenance employees in all process hazard analyses, incident investigations, emergency response program reviews, and so on.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Team\n\n\n\nOur in-house emergency response team is trained to the structural fire brigade level4 and to HAZWOPER's hazardous materials technician level5. \n\n\n\nLoading/Unloading Procedures\n\n\n\nTrained and experienced personnel carry out material transfer activities according to detailed written work procedures.

These procedures are incorporated into this plan by reference only.\n\n\n\nMost bulk liquids are unloaded from tank cars and tank trucks to aboveground storage tanks via reinforced flexible hoses that are connected between the transport vessels and the facility's piping system.  In most of these cases, the hoses are equipped with quick couplings, but only bolted hose connections are used for normal transfers of extremely hazardous chemicals (e.g., carbon disulfide and hydrazine).  Exceptions to the bolted hose rule require approval and oversight by both the Safety and Environmental Managers in conjunction with a senior Operation's Supervisor.\n\n\n\nLow pressure Nitrogen (N2) is used to transfer low viscosity materials, especially those that present extreme fire hazards, whenever possible.  Pumps are used in other cases or when the transportation vessel does not support pressured transfers.  Bulk liquid products are loaded in much the same manner.\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nThe Safety and Health Manager is responsible for establishing the plant's security.  He ensures that a Security Guard screens all visitors to the plant during normal business hours.  Among other things, the Security Guard ensures that each person entering the facility through his station is equipped with the required personal protective equipment and that he has received the required annual briefing regarding:\n\n1. hazards present at the facility,\n\n2. policies, procedures and work rules,\n\n3. emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Safety and Health Manager also reviews the safety and health programs of each contractor and ensures that they periodically demonstrate adequate insurance coverage.\n\n\n\nIncident Reporting\n\n\n\nThe incident report system is the core of the facility's safety, health and environmental protection.
