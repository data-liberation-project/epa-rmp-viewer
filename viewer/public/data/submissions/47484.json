One such resource is our extensive suite of safety procedures.  The core of these procedures is a combination of relevant regulations, industry standards, good engineering practices and best management practices.\r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\n\r\nVanderbilt Chemical Corp. (VCC) is a specialty manufacturer of organic and organo-metallic lubricant additives, rubber accelerators, antioxidants, registered pesticide active ingredients and paint additives.  Many of our primary products belong to the dithiocarbamate family.  Some of the products are powders or pellets; others are mineral oil based concentrates or aqueous mixtures or slurries.  Co-products include aqueous solutions of sodium hydrosulfide (NaSH) and sodium sulfate (NaSO4).\r\n\r\nThe primary liquid reactants include amines, diamines, carbon disulfide, mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, alcohol complexes of dithiophosphoric acid, isopropyl and other alcohols.  We store these materials in aboveground storage tanks (AST's), tank trucks, tank cars, totes and drums.  The majority of the AST's are located in the A31 Tank Farm in the eastern portion of the site.  We receive dry solid reactants in bulk super sacks, fiber drums and paper sacks and store them primarily in the A72 Warehouse.  These materials include, but are not limited to, metal oxides (e.g., antimony, lead, molybdenum, zinc), oxidizers (e.g., ammonium persulfate), and various minor processing aids and additives.  Some of these materials are toxic; some are flammable; and some exhibit both toxic and flammable characteri"

The list of regulated substance includes 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances.  Vanderbilt's Murray, KY facility is one of these sources.  The RMP rule describes three categories of sources and establishes different requirements for each category.  The rule considers whether the source:\r\n1. has had an accidental release of a regulated substance with off-site consequences within the last five years,\r\n2. could have an accidental release of a regulated substance that could cause off-site consequences,\r\n3. falls into a specific type of industry and\r\n4. is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management rule2 (PSM).\r\nVanderbilt handles two regulated (toxic) substances in greater than threshold amounts and otherwise meets conditions 2, 3 and 4, therefore it is subject to Program 3 requirements.  Vanderbilt's Murray facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance that resulted in off-site consequences within the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule requires each affected stationary source to report its 5-year accident history and to determine the off-site consequences of a worst case release for each regulated substance that it handles above the threshold amount.  For releases of regulated toxic substances, the rule defines worst case as a release whose toxic endpoint reaches the greatest distance from the point of the release under standard weather conditions that do little to dissipate the vapor cloud.  The RMP rule defines a unique toxic end point for each regulated substance.  Worst case naturally occurs when the largest amount of the substance is spilled and the resulting pool has the largest possible surface area.

The RMP rule establishes standard worst case weather conditions and requires each source to consider these conditions when modeling its worst-case releases.  In addition to being worst case, these standard conditions assure that all sources evaluate their scenarios under the same conditions.  Facilities may use weather conditions that are appropriate for their location in their alternate scenarios.  We chose to use the average conditions as based on the closest National Weather Service station (i.e., Paducah, KY) for all alternate scenarios.

The RMP rule sets a concentration of 160 mg/m3 in air to establish the toxic end point for CS2.  We receive this material in 10,000-gallon tank cars and transfer it to one of two 12,500-gallon AST's.  From here, we meter out relatively small amounts to vessels in the various process trains.  Nitrogen pressure is used to force the CS2 off the rail cars into our AST's.  Once in the AST's, we store it under water until it is combined with other ingredients and we transfer it into the process vessels using water pressure.  In addition, both AST's are located under water to ensure that any accidental release from a tank will be protected.  We have always used this simple, robust safeguard at Murray because it maximizes safety and eliminates evaporative losses to the air.  The operating permit issued by the Division for Air Quality of the Kentucky Environmental Protection Cabinet requires us to maintain this water cap at all times.  In addition to this safeguard, Vanderbilt takes other precautions when handling and storing CS2:\r\n1. using N2 pressure to unload eliminates mechanical pump seals;\r\n2. rail cars must not have bottom valves;\r\n3. all unloading is over-the-top;\r\n4. all unloading connections are bolted (no quick-coupled hose connections);\r\n5. special unloading and handling instructions and training.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case accident under the RMP rule is a spill of the entire contents of a tank car into the area around the rail siding at worst case weather conditions.  Such an accident would spill 10,000 gallons (105,000 pounds) of CS2 into an unlined stormwater ditch.  The resulting evaporating pool would have a surface area of about 5,600 square feet (i.e., 520 m2).
