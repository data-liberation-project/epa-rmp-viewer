KAAPA Ethanol, L.L.C.A\u00bfs corporate policies places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.  The owners, management and employees of the KAAPA Ethanol facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous materials.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,  Kearney County Emergency Management (Local Emergency Planning Committee), and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the processing of grain into fuel-grade ethyl alcohol.  The ethyl alcohol manufacturing process involves the use of anhydrous ammonia and natural gasoline.  The natural gasoline is referred to as product denaturant and is used to make the ethyl alcohol unfit for human consumption.   \r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tFive-Year Accident History.  On March 4, 2004 KAAPA Ethanol had one denaturant spill within the tank farm.  A level indicated was found to be un-calibrated during initial build.  The lack of calibration caused the tank to overflow within the tank farm.  Parameters have been put into place to ensure no repeated circumstances.  All proper notifications were completed as required on the state and federal level.  There were no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  There were no known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage as a result of the denaturant spill. \r\n\r\n4.\tEmergency Response.  The emergency response program established by KAAPA Ethanol allows for personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances in the event the release can be controlled using KAAPA Ethanol personnel and equipment in the area.

The Emergency Action Plan is provided below for reference.  \r\n\r\n\r\n5.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program.   KAAPA Ethanol, L.L.C. plant has implemented several environmental, emergency, and safety programs at the facility.  These plans are crucial in our every day operation and procedures.  Daily, weekly, and monthly checks are completed that affect our ability to respond to emergencies, including a Health and Safety Plan.   Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPP) plans have been prepared and implemented, with updates completed as needed to ensure compliance and effectiveness.   All implementation is accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and time frames.  KAAPA Ethanol has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for a Program Level 3 facility.  The facility conducts weekly and monthly training as part of our normal activities.  Training consists of regulated safety requirements.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented in accordance to regulation.  Products on site under the PSM program are anhydrous ammonia and natural gasoline.  The PSM program covers anhydrous system, distillation tanks and piping, and storage tanks utilized for anhydrous ethanol and denatured ethyl alcohol.   Safety inspections are completed regularly, utilizing in-house and outside expertise to conduct.  Periodic reviews are completed on plans and procedures in place, with scheduling for additional training as part of the review process.  \r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned changes to Improve Safety.
