The process is located at 3901 S. 28th Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85040.  The chlorine system for Aqua Clear consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.

      "SummaryText": "rams, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (June 2004), the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Aqua Clear's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Aqua Clear has a B-kit available at the facility in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAqua Clear has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
