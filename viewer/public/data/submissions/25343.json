Accordingly, the worst-case release analysis was performed at this level.\r\n\r\n(e) Surface roughness\r\n\r\nRMP regulations require that either urban or rural topography should be used for performing the air dispersion analysis for the identified release scenarios.  The rural and urban topographical conditions are characterized in the air dispersion models in terms of surface roughness.  The rural condition, defined by EPA as no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed, is characterized by a surface roughness of 0.03 meter, whereas the urban condition is characterized by a surface roughness of 1.0 meter.  \r\n\r\n(f) Dense or neutrally buoyant gases\r\n\r\nRMP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.

The release rate is assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10.  The boiling point temperature for chlorine is -31 degrees F; thus, chlorine is a gas at ambient temperature.

The scenario selected involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails) connected to the one-ton containers.  \r\n\r\nUpon release of the chlorine gas from the line, the leak detection system (with battery backup) would activate the emergency shut off system for the chlorine cylinder.

This system will allow for immediate notification of chlorine leaks to facility operators who will then initiate the emergency response plan\r\n\r\nThe amount of chlorine released will be less than the EPA reportable amount of 10 pounds.

It is in compliance with all EPA Prevention Program Requirements.\r\n\r\n1. Process Safety Information - Red Bluff WWTP has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.\r\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been conducted appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, a"

It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every three years and the WWTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\r\n3. Operating Procedures - WWTP has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.  These procedures are included in the facility operations manual and the Process Safety Management manual.  The manual includes procedures for operation of all phases of the processes, and normal and emergency shutdown of the process.  \r\n4. Employee Training: - All existing and newly assigned employees are trained and tested competent in all operation procedures.  Training documentation is maintained on all applicable employees, refresher training is provided quarterly.\r\n5. Mechanical Integrity - WWTP has a preventive maintenance program that insures the mechanical integrity of its chlorination processing equipment, which includes periodic inspection, testing and an annual overhaul of critical processing equipment.\r\n6. Management of Change - WWTP has implemented written procedures to manage changes (except changes in-kind) to process chemical technology, equipment and procedures.  Employees affected by a change in a process are informed of and trained in the change prior to start up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operation procedures are updated accordingly.\r\n7. Pre-Startup Review - Written procedures have been developed to allow operators to perform a pre-startup safety review for new and modified chlorination equipment, or where modification to the process is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\r\n8. Compliance Audits - Compliance audits will be performed every three years to verify that the pr"

The two most recent audits will be kept.\r\n9. Incident Investigation - Red Bluff WWTP will investigate any incident, which results or could result in a catastrophic release of chlorine gas.  The investigation will be conducted within 48 hours of the incident.  All key factors will be addressed and recommendations for correction will result.  Affected personnel will review the findings of the investigation.  The report will be kept for 5 years.\r\n10. Employee Participation - Managers and operators of Red Bluff WWTP water treatment plants participated in the process hazard analysis.  The PHA has been made available to all affected employees and is kept at the facilities.\r\n11. Hot Work Permit - A hot work permit process has been developed and implemented for hot work operations conducted on or near the chlorination process.  The permit documents the fire and accident prevention requirements and is implemented prior to beginning any hot work operations.  The permit is kept on file until the completion of any hot work.\r\n12. Contractors - Contractors working on or near the water treatment plant are required to comply with the regulatory provisions of the OSHA process safety management standard.  A form has been developed to address the following: contractor safety program; informing contractor employees of the hazards on the site; review of the emergency evacuation plans; record contractor meetings of the plans; and require contractors to train their employees on the hazards of the process. \r\n13. Injury and Illness Prevention Program - The WWTP has an active IIPP meeting the requirements of Cal/OSHA Section 3203 that addresses the following;\r\n* Assignment of safety responsibilities\r\n* Programs designed to gain employee involvement such as safety reward and recognition, safety suggestion incentives,"
