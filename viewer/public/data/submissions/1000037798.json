The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1, 2, and 3), the worst case release was modeled as if the 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia pressure vessel was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.  For the aqua ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 4 and 5), the worst case release scenario assumes that the 22,665-gallon aqua ammonia AST failed and instantaneously spills the content into secondary containment that has a total containment capacity of 12,492 gallons when considering displacement of the other ASTs within the containment.  Therefore, some of the aqueous ammonia spills over the containment and collects onto the ground.  For purposes of determining the impacted surface area adjacent to the containment, it was assumed that the aqueous ammonia covers the impacted areas to a depth of 1 cm.  The resulting release is evaporation at the maximum temperature.  \r\n\r\nDepending on the covered process, the alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for anhydrous ammonia assumes a release of anhydrous ammonia due to (1) rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation associated with Covered Process 1; (2) leaking 2-inch process piping during transfer and blending at Covered Process 2; and rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose during transfer and blending at Covered Process 3.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (i.e. excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and internal safety valves on the commercial tanker truck; emergency shutoff valve at th"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program document (PSM/RMPr) was prepared on behalf of Helena Chemical Company (HCC) pursuant to the requirements of the Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(r) as codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.119 and by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR \u00a768.  The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at the Garden City Facility, Garden City, KS.  At this Facility, HCC engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of chemicals (i.e. retail) to customers, most of who use HCC's products to support agricultural operations.  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia from the Garden City Facility located at 1004 N. Anderson Road, Garden City, KS 67846.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Garden City Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Garden City Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHCC is submitting this plan as a 5-year update.  All applicable sections of the EPA RMP Submit and the Facility Program 3 PSM/RMPr have been addressed.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Operations at the Garden City Facility consists of agricultural chemical storage and handling, manufacturing, retail sale and distribution.  As related to the PSM/RMPr, the Garden City Facility stores and handles two covered chemicals (anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA, and operates five (5) covered processes that involve storage, handling, and processing of the covered chemicals.  The five covered processes include:\r\n\r\no\tCovered"

The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked at the Facility until the covered chemicals are transferred from the commercial tanker truck to either Covered Process 1 (anhydrous) or 4 (aqueous).  Once the transfer is complete, the commercial tanker truck leaves the Facility.  \r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia contained in Covered Process 1 (i.e. 30,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel) is used as an ingredient to make other types of fertilizers in Covered Processes 2 and 3.  Covered Process 2 is a stationary blender that is owned and operated by the Facility.  Covered Process 3 is a Mobile Pipe Reactor that is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC).  Covered Processes 2 and 3 do not have any storage capacity to store anhydrous ammonia.  However, Covered Process 2 is physically connected to Covered Process 1 by process piping and Covered Process 3 is physically connected to Covered Process 1 by transfer hose when on-site and operating.  The fertilizer that is blended in Covered Process 2 is referred to as Base or 10-30-0.   Base (i.e. 10-30-0) is a fertilizer that is manufactured by blending water, mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP), and clay suspension (a gelling agent).  Once the anhydrous ammonia is blended, the anhydrous ammonia becomes inert and therefore the Base product is not subject to the PSM/RMP.  The fertilizer that is blended in Covered Process 3 is referred to as ammonium polyphosphate or 10-34-0.   Ammonium Polyphosphate (i.e. 10-34-0) is a liquid fertilizer that is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with water and super-phosphoric acid in a \"Mobile Pipe Reactor\" (MPR).  Once th"

Covered Process 5 is a stationary blender that is owned and operated by the Facility.  Covered Process 5 does not have any storage capacity to store aqueous ammonia.  However, Covered Process 5 is physically connected to Covered Process 4 by process piping.  The fertilizer that is blended in Covered Process 5 is referred to as O-Phos.  O-Phos is a fertilizer that is manufactured by blending aqueous ammonia with water and phosphoric acid in an Initial Blender (pipe blender), cooling tower, and heat exchanger.  The solution is then transferred to the O-Phos Mix Pot and blended with other confidential ingredients.  Once the aqueous ammonia is blended in the Initial Blender, the aqueous ammonia becomes inert and therefore the O-Phos product is not subject to the PSM/RMP.  \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in Covered Process 1 is 184,948 lbs (assuming that the 30,000-gallon pressure vessel and a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck are filled to their administrative capacities); and the total aqua ammonia that can be stored in Covered Process 4 is 48,200 lbs (assuming that the 22,665-gallon AST and the 8,000-gallon commercial tanker truck are filled to their administrative capacities).  While Covered Processes 2, 3, and 5 are not able to store the respective covered chemical, they are considered a Covered Process per the rule.  As required by the EPA Database, covered processes must have quantities that are equal to or greater than the EPA threshold quantity.  For this reason, the total quantity reported in the EPA RMP Submit Report is greater than the total quantity that is actuall"
