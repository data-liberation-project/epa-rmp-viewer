This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nHunt Southland's Rogerslacy Refinery located in Sandersville, Mississippi operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, primarily asphalt related, from raw crude oil. Within the refining industry we are known as a topping operation in that our focus is on the 50% to 55% of the barrel of crude which is asphalt. The remaining light ends are sold as either non-highway diesel or as feedstock for other refineries, or used in specialty asphalt products, i.e. cutback asphalts. \n\nThe Rogerslacy refinery is considered small by industry standards with a maximum capacity of 12,500 barrels per day. For the past several years we have averaged less that 6,000 bpd and have only run two weeks of every month. While the capacities of our actual process units do not reach the threshold quantities for RMP/PSM coverage, storage of light naphtha does meet the criteria for RMP under regulated flammable substances. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION STEPS \n\nWhile threshold quantities of toxic and flammable substances are not met for any of Hunt Southland's processes other than storage of light naphtha, we have developed process safety guidelines for processes that represent the greatest risk to Hunt Southland employees the public, and the environment. In addition to these process safety guidelines, Hunt Southland has numerous other programs that incorporate accident prevention and loss cont"

      "SummaryText": "rol. \n\nEmployee participation takes place on both an informal and formal basis. Informally, safety suggestions and concerns are relayed to management through supervisors or directly. The safety manager also collects suggestions during safety walk-throughs. Incident investigations are conducted with hourly employees participating in the investigation team.\n\nProcess safety information is kept with several departments at the refinery including the EHS, maintenance, and analytical laboratory departments. In addition to typical hazard communication information, documents are also kept on key process parameters, chemical mixture, technical manuals for key equipment, and industry guidelines for safe operations in petroleum refineries. \n\nAs the storage tank for light naphtha has few \"processes\" a \"what if\" analysis was developed to address process hazards. The light naphtha storage tank has an internal floating roof that is the key component that could fail and significantly increase the risk of a VCE. The storage tank is also gauged daily. During this gauging the tank is inspected for problems or weakened components.\n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has historically experienced a low employee turnover rate. As a consequence, refinery personnel are quite knowledgeable and effective. Additionally, all employees are trained under OSHA's 24 Hour Hazardous Waste Operator Standard and at the state fire academy for fire brigaded training. Refreshers are conducted annually for Hazwoper and semi-annually for fire training (two days). \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has historically used the same contractors for construction and maintenance within the facility. Contractors are expected to know and follow Hunt Southland's safety standards and to work under the oversight of a Hunt Southland supervisor at all times while within the refinery facility.\n\nWhile a pre-startup safety review is followed for significant changes within the refinery and would be part of any maintenance operati"

      "SummaryText": "on or equipment modification, a PSSR has not been part of the light naphtha storage activities. \n\nMechanical integrity of the storage tank is focused on the proper operation and maintenance of the internal floating roof and the gauging for thickness of the steel shell. During all maintenance operations, standard safe work practices are utilized including lockout/tagout, line breaking procedures, confined space safety, hot work permits, and static electric spark minimization. \n\nWhile the operational controls would not change much over time, management of change is still considered critical when changes are made to other processes and especially safety systems. Accident and incident investigation are conducted whenever there has been an accident, near miss, or other incident. A compliance audit is conducted on the storage tank during its semi-annual inspections for floating roof tanks. A tracking system is in place to monitor any recommendations.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe key element of release containment, control, and mitigation is the permanent foam chamber installed in the roof of the storage tank. External monitors and other fire suppression equipment are stored near the vicinity of the tank. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn reviewing the OSHA 200 logs for the last five years there were no accidents or incidents related to the naphtha storage process.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company maintains written emergency response programs for a variety of regulatory programs. The programs include: TIER II reports for EPCRA, emergency action plans, emergency response plans, SPCC plans, pipeline spill response plans, and process safety management plan.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nHunt Southland Refining Company has extended the supply line for the foam chamber to the light naphtha storage tank from a more accessible location as a better means of supplying foam in the event of a fire."
