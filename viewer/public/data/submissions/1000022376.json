The equipment and connections are still there to do this process and we have no desire to remove this process at this time, preferring to keep our options open as we review the availability of EDA via Railcar vs truck.  If we were to restart this process a new PHA and PSSR would be held prior to restarting this process.  This is the reason the PHA is past the 5 year limit and the SOP is past a year old.  \n\nAlso Reactor E has not been in service longer than 3 years, the reason no Compliance audit has been performed on it.  \n\nThe below summary has been Reviewed and Approved: 5/26/2011\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nConcern for health, safety and environmental issues forms an integral part of Fort Amanda Specialties LLC business policy.

The facility consists mainly of an administration building, manufacturing/technical building and four tank farms.\n \n The main products manufactured at the Lima facility are called chelates.  Chelates are chemical compounds that have the ability to complex or interact with metal ions like calcium and iron and change the property of the metal ion.  For example, chelates will prevent hard water metal ions like calcium from forming precipitates and scale. Because of their unique ability to chelate metals, these chelate products are used in numerous household cleaners, personal care products, photographic processing and a host of industrial applications like pulp and paper manufacture, latex polymerization and energy production to name a few.\n \n The Lima facility creates all of its products through hydrocyanic acid ('HCN') chemistry.  The facility takes HCN, which is a co-product in the manufacturing of acrylonitrile, from the adjacent INEOS Chemicals facility.  The HCN is received through a pipeline from the INEOS Chemicals facility and is piped into reactors.  The HCN is reacted immediately upon entering the reactors with various raw materials to produce the different chelates and other products.\n \n The Lima facility handles five regulated substa"

HCN is not 'stored' on-site - it is taken from the INEOS Chemicals pipeline and placed directly into process vessels.  EDA is received in tank trucks and occasionally rail tank cars and is stored on-site in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  EDA is used as a raw material in the process.  Formaldehyde is received in tank trucks and is stored in three 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  Formaldehyde is also used as a raw material in the process.  Aqueous ammonia is a raw material in one process and a co-product in two other processes.  It is stored in one of three storage tanks (one 50,000 gallon; two 30,000 gallon), depending on which process it is associated with.  Aqueous ammonia is delivered and shipped in tank trucks and pipeline to INEOS Chemicals.  ACH is received in tank trucks and is stored in one 10,000 gallon storage tank.  ACH is used as a raw material in the process.  \n \n \n Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n The Lima facility has reviewed all the covered processes at the facility to determine which Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) would be reported.  All scenarios were calculated using the RMP*Comp software, which is based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis ('OCA') Guidance.  All assumptions made in the OCA guidance (i.e. wind speed and stability, release elevation, etc.) were used in the scenario evaluation.  Based on the number of buildings and structures surrounding the plant, urban topography was used in all modeling.  In each ARS evaluation, the facility chose to consider 'worst case' type conditions (i.e. response teams taking longer than expected, etc.).\n \n The Worst Case Scenario, which involves a toxic release from the cyanide weigh tank (a tank used to verify the weight of HCN prior to being placed in the reactor) results in offsite impacts on neighbors,"

      "SummaryText": " a public recreation area (the Rotary River Walk) and industrial facilities.  This scenario takes into consideration administrative controls that limit the amount of HCN in the weigh tank, which include operating procedures, operator training, computer interlocks and redundant monitoring systems.  These controls limit the weight of HCN in the weigh tank, which has a capacity of 5,800 pounds, to the maximum charge weight of 2,900 pounds.  In addition to the administrative controls, a containment dike, considered passive mitigation, would control the release as the HCN is liquefied by refrigeration.  This concrete dike acts to control the release to the atmosphere because it reduces the surface area of the release and thus reduces the release rate.\n \n The ARS for HCN involves a toxic release caused by a gasket leak on the feed pump from the HCN weigh tank to the reactor.  The feed pump creates a flow rate that averages approximately 20 lb/min.  The gasket leak would allow approximately 20% of the flow to be released.  Due to HCN monitoring equipment located around the weigh tank, the control room operators would know immediately that an HCN leak existed and could shut the pump down and close all necessary valves from the control room.  It is assumed the release can be stopped and the system isolated within 10 minutes.  All of the material released would be contained in the containment dike around the weigh tank and weigh tank pump because the HCN is liquefied by refrigeration.  This reduces the surface area of the release and thus reduces the release rate to 4 pounds/minute.  The release would have offsite impacts on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, but would not impact other public or environmental receptors.\n \n The ARS for EDA involves a toxic release caused by total failure of the offloading hose from the rail car to the storage tank.  The rail car offloads from the top and is pressurized to assist the pump in offloading.  The failure of the line"

It is assumed it will take the response team 30 minutes to accomplish this.  All of the material released would be contained in the containment dike around the rail car and offloading pump.  This reduces the surface area of the release and thus reduces the release rate to 17.9 pounds/minute.  The release would have offsite impacts on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, but would not impact other public or environmental receptors.\n \n The ARS for Formaldehyde Solution involves a toxic release caused by total failure of the offloading hose from the tank truck to the storage tanks.  The tank truck offloads from the bottom of the truck.  It is assumed the entire contents of the tank truck releases through the discharge line prior to it being shut down.  The release would be contained in the containment dike around the storage tanks and truck offloading area.

In addition, all safe guards are assumed to function properly.\n\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n The facility strives to prevent accidental releases through many varied approaches.  First, the facility has complied with the OSHA PSM regulation since the facility was built in 1993.  The facility has applied the spirit of the PSM regulation to all facility activities, not just those covered by the regulation.  This is evidenced by the facilities involvement with the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care program.  Due to this proactive approach, procedures are already in place and active for the RMP covered processes.\n \n The facility has many technological prevention steps, which include:\nA? computerized control systems\nA? computerized interlocks and permissives\nA? redundant controls on critical systems\n\nIn addition, the facility has trained operators running the processes.  Each operator goes through extensive training, including classroom, computer based and on-the-job training prior to becoming certified operators.  To assist the operators in running the plant sa"
