      "SummaryText": "(a) (c)  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source include the Production Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  This procedure follows the guidelines set forth by OSHA's PMS standard.  Chemical specific accidental release prevention steps in the SOP include actions taken at the start of each production shift. 1) Check the uploading system to ensure that the uploading pressure is set and functioning at 30-40 psig.  2) Check both regulators to ensure that the back-up safety regulator is also working.  3) Start the fume scrubber and check for suction at the inlet port.  4) Check the emergency exhaust fan to ensure that it functions.  5) Check transfer lines and hoses for any posible leaking.  6) Notify the supervisor for any improper system function.  Supervisors should immediately shut off transfer lines at the regulators.  In addition, a specific Titanium Tetrachloride (T-4) Emergency Response SOP, from the Integrated Contingency Plan, is posted at the stationary source site.\n\n(b)  Spectra Technologies, 11AT Operations, manufactures the CXU 3A/B Cold Smoke Signal Cartridge.  Titanium Tetrachloride (T-4) is the smoke producing chemical compound contained within the cartridge.  Glass ampoules are filled with T-4 and flame sealed.  In essence, this is a repackaging operation, transferring T-4 from a DOT cylinder into an ampoule.  A common ventilation system for the filling stations exhausts T-4 aerosol into a scrubber.\n\n(d)  This is a new operation with no release history.\n\n(e)The worst case scenario involves the catestrophic rupture of one DOT cylinder containing 3,500 pounds of T-4.  The cylinder is contained within a 10 ft x 20 ft x 1 ft high concrete dike.  Using the EPA's RMP Comp modeling program, the worst case endpoint is 0.4 miles.  Our scaled map of the Highland Industrial Park, 11AT Area and surrounding areas, shows that there are no residences of any kind within the 0.4 mile endpoint.  Emergency response procedures"

[Even though quantities of T-4 do not meet OSHA's PSM threshold, as a matter of good practice, emergency response is included in Spectra's Integrated Contingency Plan.]\n\n(f)  Planned changes to improve safety includes annual training of operators as to requirements of the Production SOP and T-4 specific Emergency Response SOP.  Additional training for First Responders, Technicians, and Incident Commander is to be conducted annually."
