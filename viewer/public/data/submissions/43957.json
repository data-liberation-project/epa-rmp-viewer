Our plant has operated safely since its initial startup in 1961 without a major incident affecting our community.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals:\n\nToxics\n\nOur facility uses two RMP-regulated toxic chemicals, chlorine and phosphorous oxychloride,  to produce our products.\n\nChlorine, which is purchased and not manufactured, is used at our site to produce benzyl chloride and Tetrathal\u00ae, and is stored in and distributed from railroad tank cars shared between the two processes.  Chlorine is a gas at normal pressure and temperature, but is stored as a liquid under pressure in the tank cars.  It is unloaded directly from the tank car into a steam-heated vaporizer, where it is heated up to vaporize the liquid chlorine for use in both the benzyl chloride and Tetrathal\u00ae processes.\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) is used in our Phosphate Esters manufacturing facility to manufacture dibutyl phenyl phosphate (DBPP), tri-isobutyl phosphate (TiBP) and several plasticizer products (Santicizers 141, 148, and 2148). Phosphorus oxychloride is received in tanker trucks and unloaded into a storage tank, from where it is transferred to the Phosphate Esters manufacturing process.\n\nFlammables:\n\nWe have no RMP-regulated flammables stored or handled at our facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
