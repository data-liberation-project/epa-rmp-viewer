If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Atlanta Fire Department 17 and request that they respond to our emergency.\n\n\n\n This facility is a propane distribution facility. The primary purpose is the distribution of propane to our retail locations via tank truck. This facility receives propane by tank truck and rail car. This facility consists of thirty-four 90,000 gallon tanks, and sixty 30,000 gallon tanks and one 12,000 gallon tank, and necessary piping, valves, and pumps to facilitate transfer of propane into and out of the bulk storage tanks.\n\n\n\n Our worst-case scenario is failure of a 90,000 gallon propane tank when filled to 85%, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to the EPA's, RMP* Comp, the distance to the end point is .6 mile.  \n\n\n\n There are approximately 5,000 people living within this distance. There is one school, and no hospitals within this distance. There are no environmental receptors. The alternate case scenario results in a .05-mile distance to end point. There are 0 people living within this distance.\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane systems are designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. In the event of an emergency involving our propane systems, it is our policy to notify the Atlanta Fire Department no, 17 and request that they respond to our emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the Fire Department have inspected our propane system.\n\n\n\nWe have no plans at this time to change our safety procedures."
