              "Description": "The VersaCold Hazardous Materials Release Prevention Program is built upon the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for the ammonia refrigeration system. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design. All components of the system have been designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, Pressure Vessel Codes and all other safety standards in effect at the time of installation. In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and motored for system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safety procedures when operating the equipment from normal start-up, to running, to emergency shut down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies. Operator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands on practice in the use of personal protective equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (?what-if?) study helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safely and effectively in order to mitigate potential releases. Lock-out/tag-out procedures are very important in preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system. Spill containment and clean-up training is important so that the effects of a spill are minimized. General employee training involves knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures. Annual corporate Safety Audits include evaluations and recommendations for updating and improving the program.",

      "SummaryText": "The VersaCold facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the refrigeration and cold storage services provided for customers. Refrigeration capacity is provided from a central engine room and refrigerant is transported to various freezing and cooling systems located throughout the facility via a piping system. An evaluation was performed using a ?what-if? hazard evaluation criteria as set forth in the guidelines for Chemical Hazard Evaluation Procedures prepared by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. This method was used to identify the potential hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, and the likely consequence of those hazards when an accidental release event is experienced, including those due to earthquake equipment failure, operator error, design deficiencies, and maintenance. The facility is operated by refrigeration engineers and technicians association (RETA) certified refrigeration operators and the equipment is in good condition and maintained to establish maintenance standards. In addition, various controls are utilized to maintain equipment at proper operating ranges and to automatically provide shut down in the event that equipment begins to operate out of the designed safe range. All equipment utilized in the refrigeration system is treated for the use of ammonia refrigerant.  Storage and operating vessels are ASME rated and employ emergency pressure relief valves required by code for vessel protection. Due to the many safety features of the facility, including documented operating procedures, ammonia releases other than small leaks are considered unlikely. Our controls were put in real life test on July 31, 2003 when our plant experienced an ammonia leak, our controls in place and training given to responding personnel resulted in no injuries or off-site consequences. Since that time additional safety measures have been implemented to further mitigate. VersaCold currently has several operating and main"
