The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site.  The Allied facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community.  Allied's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the One Plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers).  In addition, Allied manufactures 10.5%-15% (by weight) sodium hypochlorite, and 38% (by weight) sodium bisulfite.  The facility includes a private sidetrack for unloading chlorine and sulfur dioxide railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks and for sodium hypochlorite production and quality control testing.  Sodium bisulfite production operations are at a separate location within the facility, with a scrubber for the manufacturing process.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection system continuously monitors all production and storage locations.  \n\nBased upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a covered process, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTIO"

      "SummaryText": "N STEPS\nThe Allied accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management rule (29CFR \u00c2\u00a71910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (40 CFR \u00c2\u00a768),\n\u00c2\u00b7 Implementation of the National Association of Chemical Distributors Responsible Distribution Process Code,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Operator Function Specific and Emergency Response Training,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Employee Hazardous Communication and Personal Protective Equipment Training,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Preventative maintenance schedule,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Use of Chlorine Institute and Compressed Gas Association recommended equipment,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Use of effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators, facility managers and corporate managers,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Performance of a process hazard analysis,\n\u00c2\u00b7 Implementation of a three year program internal auditing program.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo deaths, evacuations, and/or shelter in place do to a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years.  One employee injury do to sulfur dixoide exposure in the last five years, and zero employee injuries do to chlorine exposure in the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been reviewed and updated in April 2009 (Emergency Contact Phone Numbers updated annually).  The plan includes the following elements: \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 description of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes,\n\u00c2\u00b7 recommended first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures,\n\u00c2\u00b7 a list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located, \n\u00c2\u00b7 list of onsite and offsite emergency response personnel and contact numbers, \n\u00c2\u00b7 detailed description of company personnel, \n\u00c2\u00b7 emergency and non-emergency contact numbers, \n\u00c2\u00b7 procedures for reporting and handling the releases, \n\u00c2\u00b7 site and evacuation plans,\n\u00c2\u00b7 procedures for plan review and update as well as training requirements for emergency responders."
