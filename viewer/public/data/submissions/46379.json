If an emergency were to occur, it is this Facility's policy to notify the Apex Fire Department and Wake County LEPC via the \"911\" service and follow all additional response procedures set forth in the Facility's Integrated Contingency Plan, as appropriate.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Wake Medical Center and associated ambulance service via 911.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and hazardous material emergency response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Apex Terminal transfers/stores refined product (regular/premium gasoline and diesel fuel) and handles product additives, including the liquified butane blending system (direct injection into refined product pipelines).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, the 60,000 gallon vessel, the blending skid, sampling unit (Grabner), and the truck offloading station produc connection points.  The Facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the blending system's 60,000 gallon liquified (pressure) butane vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shutoff device at 85% with an alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the end point (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.5 miles and includes both public/recreational and environmental receptors including residential properties, the Knights Play Golf Center, various adjoining commercial structures and Middle Creek.  The Facility's alternate scenario (most likely) is a truck \"pull-away\" resulting in one-minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site i"

      "SummaryText": "ncluding a portion of the contiguous property (pipeline construction corporation) to the southeast.   The Motiva Enterproses, LLC - Apex Terminal complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D  - Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U. S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management regulations for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.    To this date, this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Apex Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Apex Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and hazardous substance emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Apex Fire Department and the Wake Conty LEPC.  The Apex Fire Department, which maintains a full hazardous response team, is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, access via Ten-Ten Road, and available fire suppression equipment including approximately twenty-four 20lbs. ABC fire extinguishers, and water sources (nearest hydrant available adjacent to the storage cylinder.  As this may have limited availability in the event of a fire, two additional hydrants are located contiguous to the Facility along Ten-Ten Road).  Motiva Enterprises LLC - Apex Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to mininize plant growth within 10 ft of the system."
