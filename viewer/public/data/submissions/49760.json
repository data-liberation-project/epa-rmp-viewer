It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland.  44,000 of those acres are either wetlands, or under water, including portions of the Bush and Gunpowder River and the Chesapeake Bay.  The APG comprises two areas, the Aberdeen Proving Ground Aberdeen Area (APG-AA) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area (APG-EA), which are 15 miles apart by land.  The APG is home to more than fifty tenants and numerous satellite activities.  Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC); U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School (OC&S); U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC); U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) which includes the U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.S. Army Environmental Center (AEC); U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM); and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD).\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe APG is committed to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibility.  The APG follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.  \n\nRegulated substances\n\nChlorine and anhydrous ammonia are currently the only chemicals for which APG is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program.  Chlorine is used and stored at APG's WTP and WWTP, and is presen"

Theis submission adds phosgene, which will be at APG for no more than six months during which R&D operational testing of a \"Large Item Transfer and Neutralization System\" will consume to phosgene.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe APG has a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  APG's PSM Plan addresses safety in the workplace by identifying related work processes and assuring all safety measures required are followed.

      "SummaryText": "tal Protection and Enhancement\nAR 385-40    Accident Reporting and Records\nAR 420-90    Fire Protection\nAR 500-60    Disaster Relief\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no documented accidental off site releases of any chemical, which could have had a impact to the public or environment, in the last 5 years at the APG WTP and WWTP, the CFF or R&E as addressed by this RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe APG Directorate of Safety, Health and Environment's Fire and Emergency Services Division (APG DSHE-FESD) is a comprehensive community and emergency service system.  In addition, DSHE-FESD is a member of the local community response network with mutual aid agreements in place to assist or be assisted by other fire departments, including the Harford County Hazardous Material Emergency Response Unit.  Emergency response personnel participate in addressing major regulations (such as the RMP) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.  Policy for the DSHE-FESD is defined by Army Regulation (AR) 420-90 which adopts the National Fire Protection Association codes for operation.\n\nPlanned changes:\n\nOver the past several years, a number of accidental release prevention steps have been taken to improve the safety and reliability of the chlorine systems.  The chlorine distribution systems were converted to vacuum systems with controls that will stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a pipe break or similar equipment failure.  Additionally, the amount of on-site chlorine was reduced substantially.  A variety of physical security measures are in place at all facilities, to include patrols by armed security forces to prevent unauthorized access.  APG is committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the RMP, and no significant changes to the system are currently planned. The ammonia refrigeration system at the climatic firing facility is a new installation constructed and installed to the latest engineering design and safety standards. A"

      "SummaryText": "dditional safety valves have been installed in the system to substantially reduce the quantity of any release. In addition air monitoring has been installed in all buildings serviced by the refrigeration system to provide an early warning system for personnel in and around the facility and system equipment shutdown. No changes to the system are currently planned."
