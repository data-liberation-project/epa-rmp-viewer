Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  Edwards Power Station operates in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Program regulations.\r\n\r\nPolicies and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The ammonia system employed at the Edwards Power Station facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.  The monitoring system is comprised of pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor control operations.  These safety features in the SCR system include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shut down button that cuts off power to the SCR equipment, and relief valves on all pressure vessels.  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable ammonia releases at Edwars Power Station over the past eight years (October 2005 - October 2013) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nEdwards Power Station has an Emergency Response Plan in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives.\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nEdwards Power Station maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nEdwards Power Station, located in Bartonville, Illinois, uses ammonia to help maintain air quality compliance of the emission stack, specifically reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  Senior managment at Edwards Power Station is committed to offering superior service, and to maintain safety and environmental programs that promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Edwards Power Station administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  The facility also has a PSM/RMP Committe that meets regularly to review the Program components and ensure that all requirements are being met.  All of these programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nEdwards Power Station is located at 7800 South Cilco Lane, Bartonville, Illinois 61607.  The system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nThe system uses approximately 353,400 pounds of ammonia per year in the Selective Catalytic Reductin (SCR) system to help maintain air quality compliance of the stack emissions, specifically reducing NOx (NO and NO2) emissions.  The SCR process occurs naturally with the ammonia mixing and reacting with the flue gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the reducing agent.  When in operating mode, the anhydrous ammonia system is automatically controlled based on system demand.  The anyhdrous ammonia is stored in two 30,420-gallon tanks, which are located outside of facility walls.  Site specific Program Operating Procedures limit the total amount of ammonia stored"
