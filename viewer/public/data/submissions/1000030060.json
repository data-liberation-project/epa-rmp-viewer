The facility is located at 4413 West Bogart Rd., Sandusky, OH 44870.  The SIC code for the operation is 2011, the NAICS code is 311611.  The facility has approximately 250 full time employees.  The facility processes/packages food product 16-20 hours/day and sanitation for 4-8 hours per day, 5 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The final working capacity of both systems exceeds 10,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe two systems meet the criteria in the EPA Guidance as being co-located, and as such, are reported as one covered process.  Both systems are located within the same building.  Parts of the west system, including a vessel, are located in near proximity to the east system such that an external event (i.e. fire, collapse or collision) could cause a release from both systems.  Air cooling evaporators from both systems are also located in a common cooler.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is recirculated in the systems as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration systems are designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia during the previous five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental"

The west system has been modified several times since its original installation however, system capacity has not materially changed.  The east system was installed in 1992.  \n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system shutdown can be manually operated using an E-Stop switch located outside the both engine rooms.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and "

All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident evacuation drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that required evacuation or sheltering in place of the public or that resulted in onsite of offsite injuries or deaths.  Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Fire Department will be provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan upon request.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe prevention plan includes routine and periodic inspections and audits of the process and prevention programs to identify potential deficiencies.  The Process Hazard Analyses are conducted initially, as part of major additions or modifications and every five years to identify potential hazards in the process and provide recommendations to eliminate or reduce hazards and improve process safety and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
