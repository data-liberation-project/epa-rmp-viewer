The chlorine is stored in a restricted, fenced area to prevent vandalism or accidental/incidental contact with the chlorine containers or feed equipment. There are two, one-ton cylinders and normally only 14, 150-pound cylinders on site with a possibility of 20, 150-pound cylinders maximum at any given time; for a total of 7,000 pounds of chlorine on site.  Both one-ton cylinders have the protective hoods removed at the same time, this is to allow for the application of the feeding mechanism to insure automatic and continuous chlorine feeding during crossover from the empty cylinder to the full cylinder. However, only one of the cylinders will have the valve open at one time except during the crossover period, which should not exceed more than a few hours.  The 150-pound cylinders are only stored in the Chlorine building and are not part of the chlorination process. All of the 150-pound cylinders will have the vales closed and protective hoods on and chained in place. This in effect helps protect the environment from the probability of a release of the worst-case scenario magnitude.\n\nThere are procedures and equipment in place to contain a chlorine release and to warn the public if necessary for health and safety purposes. All emergency procedures are coordinated through Weatherford Fire Chief, Mike Karlin.  All Custer County emergency services are available to Weatherford upon need. The operator in charge has written policy to follow in the event of a chemical release. The first of which is to call 911 for notification and assistance and then to contain the leak.\n\nWeatherford has a two million gallon per day wastewater treatment facility and is required by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality to chlorinate the effluent"

Chlorine injected into the wastewater at the introduction of the effluent basin disinfects the effluent water prior to reintroduction to the environment. Sulfur dioxide, injected into the chlorinated water at the exit point of the effluent basin, neutralizes the chlorine, leaving chemical free water returning to the environment. \n\nAccidental release prevention is an on going daily practice as all operators observe good operations procedures, such as using fresh lead gaskets when making chlorine connections and protecting the pressurized containers from traffic and direct sun. The chlorine containers are inside a chain link fenced area to minimize access by vandals and traffic. Operators also go through bi-annual training and do hands-on exercises to demonstrate use of the emergency kit and associated safety equipment.  \n\nWeatherford has not had a reportable chemical release in the last five years.\n\nIn the event of a chemical release, the operator in charge would call 911 to notify the local emergency responders and to activate the Custer County Emergency Responders. The operators would attempt to stop the release with the emergency kit. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, the Custer County Sheriffs Department, The Weatherford Police Department, the Southwestern Oklahoma State University Police Department and the auxiliaries of these departments would go into action to block and reroute traffic away from the affected area as well as assist with evacuation if needed and public notification. The local authorities have the capabilities to interrupt local broadcast  with emergency messages in order to notify residents, that may have their televisions on, of impending danger and what precautions to take. \n\nThe operators of the wastewater facility have had training with self-contained breathing apparatus and the entire water maintenance department will be under going this training as well.
