The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases. Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders. The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning. Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\n\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\n\n\n\n  A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impacts of worst-case and alternative accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances;\n\n\n\n  A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, etc., for operations involving regulated substances;\n\n\n\n  An emergency response pro"

Wilson Station is an electric power generation station.  Anhydrous ammonia is present at this facility, above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA (the threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds; the site has a maximum capacity of 400,000 pounds.) \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, stored in two 40,000 gallon storage tanks, is fed at the SCR system for nitrous oxide removal from the effluent gas stream prior to the gas exiting through the stack. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, stored as a liquid under pressure.  The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid ammonia is released it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death.  Ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at concentrations above 50 ppm; concentration that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 300 ppm.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of ammonia so that the primary threat is to people who are unable to flee.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with requirements for hazardous materials use, and it is Big Rivers Corporation's (BREC) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is BREC's policy to notify the Ohio County LEPC and respond to the emergency.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: The D.B. Wilson station has not had an accident in the past five years involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental relea"

The hazardous materials system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance manufacturer specifications, best management practices, and state law.  The D.B. Wilson Station is required to comply with the most stringent EPA RMP and OSHA prevention programs.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is BREC's policy for the operator to evacuate the immediate area.  If any release is likely to impact off site, the local emergency services will be notified. BREC employees are trained in shelter in place, evacuation procedures, and have taken the OSHA worker right to know training.  A local contract response team is available to respond to releases.\n\n"
