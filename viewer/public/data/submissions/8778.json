      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n    Rainier Cold Storage is committed to the safety of its employees and tenants on-site. We have also gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of the neighboring community by developing an extensive emergency response plan. There are specific instructions for various types of incidents listed in the plan. We have 24-hour HAZWOPER training for our engineers and all employees have attended and completed the general awareness training. This ensures that our employees are familiar with evacuation routes and procedures in the event there is an incident. Evacuation drills have been conducted to check employee competency on the training and procedures set forth. Coordination with the Seattle Fire Department and the King County LEPC is and has been a vital part in our planning process. The Seattle Fire Department will be responsible for coordination with other local authorities in the case of off-site evacuations. Our on-site tenants have received notice of the chemical hazards and are encouraged to follow evacuation protocols, which have been provided.\n    Our facility is located at 6004 Airport Way South, Seattle, Washington. We are a frozen foods warehousing facility that constantly is receiving and distributing products all over the Puget Sound region. We are currently holding 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is used in our refrigeration systems. This facility is covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.\n    Our Emergency Response Plan, as prescribed under EPA's Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.95, covers the fundamental steps in responding to any emergency involving the leak of anhydrous ammonia from our refrigeration systems. Appendix A in the emergency response plan is the Process Hazard Analysis. This is used to help employees identify and recognize what events warrant the use of the emergency response plan. From there they can initiate notification to the trained on-site incident commanders and begin evacuations if needed. Sec"

      "SummaryText": "tion 7 of the emergency response plan clearly covers all activities that would prevent an accidental release of ammonia. This section also contains a list of emergency response equipment and the inspection/maintenance schedules for that equipment. Training for all employees is updated annually to ensure continued safety and awareness. In order to maintain the effectiveness of the Emergency Response Plan, the Emergency Contact is responsible for conducting a review of the Plan at least once each calendar year. \nExtensive air modeling has been conducted for our anhydrous ammonia in the event there would be a release. This air modeling includes a worst case scenario and an alternate release scenario that are defined as the following:\n    The worst case scenario is defined as a total release of all stored anhydrous ammonia in our entire system in ten minutes. Using the OCA Table 9 we have determined that 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia will travel 2.3 miles out from the center of our facility if the environmental conditions are \"F\" for atmospheric stability and variable winds at 1.5 mph in an urban setting. Although our facility is located in an industrial area of Seattle, Washington, a complete release could impact downtown Seattle and many residential neighborhoods. There are several environmental impacts also in the worst case that would include any city parks and recreation areas. The Duwamish Waterway falls within the impact zone and special assessments will need to be made after the release as to how the release affected the river. We feel that wind conditions and prevention techniques will help prevent harm to the environmental receptors within our impact zone. Due to the heavy populated area of our impact zone there are many schools, one airport, hospitals, prisons/correctional facilities, and major commercial, office, or industrial areas. This facility has refrigerated rooms with doors that act as enclosures in the event of an incident.\n    During our air modeling"

      "SummaryText": " we evaluated many possible events that would warrant an alternate release and have chosen one with the largest distance to endpoint as a conservative means for emergency response. We determined our alternate release scenario to be a plane crashing into the roof shearing off condensers, with an immediate release. This scenario is relevant, as a municipal airport is located within 2 miles of the facility. The piping involved is 6 inches in diameter, with pressure of 150 pounds. The release would occur over a period of 15 minutes causing 6,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to be released. This modeling was conducted using the SLAB method of air modeling with an atmospheric stability of \"E\" and with a wind speed of 1.5 mph in an urban setting. We have determined the distance to endpoint to be a radius of 0.72 miles from the center of the facility. The impact zone is much smaller in our alternate case and consequently impacts several major commercial, office, or industrial areas, but limits the number of residences due to the location of our facility. The Duwamish Waterway would be affected in the alternate case set forth and a few recreational areas including one school.   \n    In both scenarios we would like to address the awareness of major highways and freeways that run through our impact zones. In the event of a release proper authorities will be contacted in order to protect those who are using these roadways. We would also like to point out that we are located in a highly populated area that does attract homeless individuals that are known to make temporary shelters within the impact zones.\n    Rainier cold Storage understands the importance of preventive maintenance programs and emergency preparedness. Constant efforts will be made to identify viable mitigation measures and improved response in the event of a release."
