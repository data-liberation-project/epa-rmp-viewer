More important, it is an integral part of a greater commitment by CBE and it ultimate parent company, Vistra Energy Corp., to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, and the communities they serve.\n\n\n\n2.0  Background Scope Purpose\n\n\n\nCBE is a 520 MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant, located in Veazie, Maine.  CBE began operating in the spring of 2000.  As part of its air pollution control technology, CBE uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR).\n\n\n\nThe SCR process removes nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases produced during combustion of fossil fuels in the gas turbines when generating electricity.  The SCR process introduces aqueous ammonia into the exhaust gas stream and then passes the mixture through a catalyst bed.  The resultant chemical reaction generates nitrogen gas and water as the reduced end products, which in turn are released to the atmosphere via the plant's exhaust stack.\n\n\n\nCBE stores the aqueous ammonia on site as a 29.5 percent solution in a 21,282-gallon tank, which is administratively limited to 13,000 gal.  The quantity of aqueous ammonia stored exceeds the EPA regulated threshold quantity for accidental release prevention.  Therefore, CBE is s"

The RMP must include an analysis of potential off-site consequences of a regulated substance accidental release, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  Covered facilities also must submit to the EPA a summary of their risk management program, which also will be made available to other federal, state, and government agencies as well as the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nAs required, CBE performed an off-site consequence analysis that included a worst-case and alternative accident scenario of its regulated substance, aqueous ammonia.  The worst-case scenario is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance (regardless of its likelihood) that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The endpoint is a numerical concentration chosen by EPA beyond which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed without any serious health effects.  The alternative scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches off site.\n\n\n\nCBE performed a number of different accident analyses to determine which ones present the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is the radius of a circular area that might be affected in the event of an accidental chemical release.  The accident analyses followed the steps detailed in the EPA guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis,\" March 2009.  The endpoint distances were calculated using EPA's software utility program RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo ensure a hazardous chemical release does not occur, "

The ICP is designed to minimize the hazards to the public or the environment from fires, explosions, natural disasters, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of chemicals to air, soil, or surface water.  The provisions of the plan include procedures for internal and external notifications, preliminary emergency assessment, mitigating actions, and mobilization of resources.
