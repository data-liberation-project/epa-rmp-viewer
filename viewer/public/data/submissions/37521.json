Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe City of Lake Worth Water Treatment Plant (Lake Worth) is owned by the City of Lake Worth Utilities.   The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Lake Worth WTP is a Water Treament facility located on at 301 College Street,  west of downtown Lake Worth, Palm Beach County, Florida.  Lake Worth adds chlorine in their chlorination process in order to disinfect  the City's water supply.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to nineteen one-ton containers at the Chlorination process.  Two one-ton containers are always connected to the process with two on standby, while up to fourteen additional containers are stored adjacent to the connected containers.  There is another one-ton container for the basckwash system located in the chlorine storage area.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 38,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not in an enclosed in a building.\n\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Lake Worth Chlorination process in the Program 3 level.  The Lake Worth facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Lake Worth Water Treatment Plant has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  To ensure that all requirements of the RMP regulation were met, the PSM Program was reviewed and updated in 2004.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorina"

      "SummaryText": "tion processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the Lake Worth Treatment Operations Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  The staff also performed a Process Hazard Analysis of the process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Accident History\n\nThe Lake Worth Water Treatment facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n\n 5. Emergency Response Program\n\nLake Worth has an Emergency Response Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has a procedure to address small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Lake Wo"
