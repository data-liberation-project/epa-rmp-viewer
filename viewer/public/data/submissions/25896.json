      "SummaryText": "In May 2000, the City of Oak Ridge assumed ownership and operations of the Y-12 Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The WTP had been previously owned by the U.S. Department of Energy and operated by East Tennessee Mechanical Contractors (ETMC).  The water system is comprised of three subsystems that include the raw water supply system, the water treatment system and the treated water distribution system.  The system provides water for potability, cooling, process and fire protection needs to approximately 27,000 residents, as well as a host of commercial and government activities at the Y-12 and ORNL Plant sites.  Any interruption in continuous water service will have an immediate harmful impact on plant operations.  The water system is also important to public health and the economic stability of the City of Oak Ridge.  Chlorine, a regulated substance, is used for disinfection purposes in the production of potable water.  The approximate daily usage of chlorine is 170 to350 pounds.  Approximately four (4), one-ton containers are stored at the WTP and two (2), one-ton containers are stored at the River intake/Pump Station.  Two containers are on line at all times.  The WTP uses an average of one container per week and the River Intake/Pump Station uses approximately one container every 12 days; annual chlorine usage is approximately 85,000 pounds.  Chlorine is a yellow-greenish gas with a characteristic penetrating and irritating odor that is highly toxic.  Gas leaks can pose a health hazard to employees and the public and may possibly interrupt water treatment service.  Overexposure to chlorine can cause irritation to the throat and lungs and prolonged exposure can result in death.  Emergency response and process safety management plans have been developed and all personnel that handle chlorine are thoroughly trained prior to operations involving potential chlorine exposure."
