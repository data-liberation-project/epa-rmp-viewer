      "SummaryText": "VWR International (VWR) is a distributor of high-quality chemicals and laboratory supplies.  The regulated chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single ?covered process? for regulatory purposes.  The following regulated chemicals were identified to exceed the threshold quantity (TQ) for regulation under the federal Clean Air Act Accident Release Prevention rule (CAA ARP) or the associated California Regulation (Cal ARP)\n\nFederal:\nChloroform        20,000 lbs\n\n\nCalARP\nChloroform        20,000 lbs\nEthyl Ether        5,000  lbs\nHydrochloric acid    10,000 lbs\nHydrofluoric acid    650 lbs\nNitric acid        4300 lbs\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 205 liter metal drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  RMP Comp version 1.7, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility that toxic effects may be anticipated, "

The alternative release scenario is based on a more realistic hypothetical incident in which a single one-gallon (approximately 4 liter) container is dropped on the floor.\n\nAdministrative controls and active mitigation measures were not included as a factor of consideration during the worst case or alternative release scenarios.  However, both release scenarios considered indoor releases contained by dikes or berms in the flammable storage room.\n\nVWR?s prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n?    Safety Information ? includes detailed information about the hazards of the regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n?    Hazard Review ? a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures ? written SOP?s to guide employees in safety conducting normal, temporary and non-routine/emergency operations.\n\n?    Training ? includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expected to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n?    Maintenance ? required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified workers.\n\n?    Compliance Audits ? conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n?    Incident Investigation ? conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment).\n\nThe need for chemical specific prevention steps is very limited because chemicals are contained within sealed DOT-approved containers, and the containers are not opened during handling.  Flammable chemicals are stored and handled in specially designed rooms with electrical fixtures and equipment that "

In the event a container is damaged, there is special low-level ventilation to capture flammable vapors before an explosive concentration can accumulate.  Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.  \n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering from regulated substances or otherwise.  However, VWR has developed a comprehensive emergency response program that addresses small and large-scale incidents, including coordination with outside agencies and responders. The faciltity is currently engaging in spill team refresher courses that will begin in september 2008. A continuous audit of Safety Training will be placed into the current review process. Refresher courses for fork lift training and chemical hygiene are currently being updated."
