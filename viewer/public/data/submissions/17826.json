The covered process in this facility\nis a sulfur dioxide batch process.  Normal inventory in nine months of the year does not exceed\n5,000 pounds.  In the last three months of the year, usage of sulfur dioxide is increased\nnecessasitating inventory as high as 12,000 pounds.  Liquid sulfur dioxideis is used to raise the\nfree and total sulfur levels in the wines for control of microorganisims and to provide gas to fill\ntank headspaces for bacterial and oxygen control.  The completely manual operation involves\nintermittent transfer of liquid sulfur dioxide from a one-ton holding cylinder into smaller\ndispensers for addition to various wine batches.  All equipment used in the process is portable.  A\ndedicated cylinder is provided to add sulfur dioxide to crushers during grape processing.\n\nIn view of this simple operation, only minor operating hazards are involved, predominantly\ninadvertent bad connections that could be controlled by good operating and maintenance\npractices.  The plant maintaines a written proceedure for handling sulfur dioxide and requires\nperiodic inspection and maintenance on cylinders and dispensers used at the facility.  Involved\noperators are required to read and understand the Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) prior to\ninitially handling sulfur dioxide and to use personal protective equipment (PPE) i.e. respirators,\ngloves, etc. while transferring or dispensing.\n\nHighlights of the off-site consequence analysis for the plant are as follows:\n\nWorst case release (WCR) scenario is failure of one 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide vessel under\npressure of about 150 psig.\n\nAlternative release (AR) scenerio involves damage of the sulfur dioxide vessel's main valve in a\npartly-open position with an orifice diameter of one-quarter inch.\n\nThe sulfur diox"

Procedures for handling spills and immediate reporting to management are in\nplace.  These are embodied in a bound manual containing the release prevention and emergency\npolicies that the company is committed to uphold.\n\nPlant management recognizes the need for a sound prevention program and emergency response\nplanning.  A management system has been set up to assign personnel within the plant\nmanagement for RMP implementation.  Other prevention program elements that are currently in\nplace are as follows:\n\nProcess information procedures.\nInspection and maintenance policy.\nCommunications and employee training.\nPersonal protection policy.\nConfined space entry.\nOnsite contractors hazard communication policy.\nProcess hazard review.\nHot work permits.\nEnergy control program - lockout guidelines.\nHazard evaluation for general work areas.\nAccident investigation policy.\n\nAlthough the facility is not planning any process and/or equipment changes in the foreseeable\nfuture, a management of change policy will be set up for future implementation.\n\nA written employee-participation plan regarding the elements of a process hazard review and its\nrecommendations will be set up.  Affected employees will be provided access to process hazard\ndocuments and other information regarding the Plan's prevention program elements.\n\nIn-house compliance audits will be performed at least once every three years to verify that the\nprocedures and practices developed for the plan are adequate and are being followed.
