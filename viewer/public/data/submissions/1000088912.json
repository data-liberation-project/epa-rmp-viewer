      "SummaryText": "Water Treatment Plant processes.  Safety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Water Treatment Plant, including the chlorine and ammonia processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\r\n\r\n4.2\tHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Water Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\r\n\r\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.
