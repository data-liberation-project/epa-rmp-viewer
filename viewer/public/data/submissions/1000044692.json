The plan addresses procedures and steps to provide employee safety , public health and response agency interaction . The plan is summarized in a manual, which is maintained on site . The manual not only contains information relating to the safe handling of chlorine and emergency response actions, but also provides the framework for maintaining and operating chlorination equipment , conducting training programs , and completing incident investigations and compliance audits .\r\n\r\n   The Risk managerment Program includes the following elements : \r\n Accessible chorine safety information \r\n Written operating procedures\r\n Written maintenance , inspection and cleaning procedures \r\n Operator training \r\n Chlorination safety equipment ( leak detector )\r\n Safe design of chlorination system \r\n Hazard review of equipment and procedures \r\n Copliance auditing \r\n Emergency response coordination \r\n\r\n   The Potato Creek Water Pollution Control Plant utilizes chlorine to provide effluent disinfection . The facility maintains an inventory of 4,000 pounds in two (2) one- ton containers . The chlorination system consists of container-mounted regulators , chlorinators,automatic swith over units , injectors and a leak detector and alarm . Since the piping from the injectors to the regulators is under vacuum , any failure in the piping system would break the vacuum thereby limiting any potential release . Because the regulators are mounted directly on the one ton containers , nearly all of the chlorination piping is protected this way .\r\n\r\n The worst case scenario involves failure of a one ton container yielding a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a ten (10) minute period . Base on this release , a wind speed of 1.5 m/s , and an a"

The alternative scenario utillized a wind speed of 3.0 m/s and a atmospheric stability class D . He distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated as 0.1 miles . Public receptors include residences . No environmental receptors were located . \r\n\r\n In support of the probability that a worst case accidental release will not occur , a review of the process history indicates that no reportable accidental release have occurred within the past five years .
