OCWA is comitted to ensuring the safety of their employees, local residents, and potential environmental receptors through the implementation of safe chlorine utilization practices, procedures, and measures.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED - OCWA utilizes chlorine in bulk (1-ton chlorine cylinders) at their Marcellus Water Treatment Plant (WTP) for water disinfection.  At the Marcellus WTP, the water is treated using polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and powdered activated carbon (PACT), followed by mixed media filtrations.  The Marcellus WTP has a design capacity of 20 million gallons per day (MGD), however, the facility is typically operated well below this capacity.  Within the Marcellus WTP, chlorine can be administered at three locations as follows: (1) at the raw water supply; (2) at the mixed-media filters; and, (3) at the potable water supply.  The plant uses chlorine for disinfection, taste and odor control, and for maintaining chlorine residuals with the water distribution system.\n       The Marcellus WTP operates 24-hours a day, seven days a week.  The facility is manned 16 hours per day (from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.) using two shifts (facility is unmanned from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.).  Alarms at the Marcellus WTP are connected to an autodialer system and/or the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which is located at OCWA's Mattydale, New York Northern Concourse operations (OCWA's Northern Concourse facility is manned 24-hours a day).  Access to the facility is restricted by fencing.\n       The Only RMP-regulated substance utilized at the facility is gaseous chlorine.  The facility maintains a maximum of 14,000 pounds or (7) 1-ton cylinders on hand at any given time.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVEN"

These measures include: (1) chlorine cylinders are maintained in a building which would contain minor releases and dramatically reduce the impacts of a catostrophic release; (2) OCWA has developed and implemented standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the delivery of chlorine cylinders and the testing and hook-up of chlorine cylinders; (3) OCWA has intalled a leak detection system in the Chlorine Storage Room (the chlorine sniffers are tested on a routine basis, using hypochlorite); (4) the facility is equipped with heat sensitive monitors (the fire alarm system is connected to the facility's dial-out system; (5) OCWA maintains emergency safety/response equpment at the facility (equipment includes: air packs, chlorine cylinder repair kits, safety shower, eyewash station, and fire extinguishers; (6) chlorine cylinders have a number of design considerations aimed at reducing the likelihood of a significant, uncontrolled release (these include protective dome covers over the cylinder valve and fusible plugs to protect from overpressurization due to exposure to heat); (7) the Chlorine Storage Room is a non-smoking area (in addition, no flammable materials are maintained in the Chlorine Storage room); (8) the Marcellus Fire Department has been notified of the presence of chlorine cylinders (OCWA has a coordinations agreement with the Fire Department); (9) OCWA has a developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program which aims at reducing the potential for a significant chlorine release; (10) the facility maintains a back-up generator with automatic switchover capabilities (ensures uninteruppted electrical service of chlorine protective equipment; (11) the facility maintains a portable chlorine detector which can be utilized to d"
