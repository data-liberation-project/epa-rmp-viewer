This intent is aided and expanded by guidance and compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulations (called RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to manage the risks involved with storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. Our intent is further enhanced by the acknowledgement and responsible handling of our largest inventory of a highly hazardous chemical on premises, anhydrous ammonia, in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119.  These programs assist our effort to prevent releases, injury, exposure within and outside of the facility through proper training, maintenance, and adherence to protocols and programs minimizing occurrences and releases.  The Darien facility also maintains a trained response team for the control, containment and mitigation of occurrences.\n\nDarien facility safety programs are applied to all chemicals and hazardous chemicals determined by RMP.  This includes usage, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals. \n\nContinuous improvement is a vital component of our business and is also practiced on our Chemical Control Programs.  These include the reviews, investigations, and processes delineated in the PSM program.  These practices and the programs that comprise RMP and PSM as well as our Emergency Response Program (ERP), are communicated to and fully supported by the Darien facility management and the Birds Eye Foods management and company.\n\nDescription\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the key element required in our freezing and refrigeration processes.  A total of 110,900 pounds of NH3  are divided between 4 separate systems consisting of high and low pressure vessels, compressors, pumps, piping and condensers and evaporators.  These provide for frozen warehousing, cold"

Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.7 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  This scenario in unlikely to happen for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; industry standards for the manufacturing and quality controls of the vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in the service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, as necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms are in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and an emergency response plan and equipment are in place at the facility. Alarm systems are also tied to outside security agencies for calls to emergency response agencies in the community and our own responders.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nA variety of valves and relief valves are positioned in engine rooms and appropriate equipment based on mechanical design, PSM requirements, and through review and preventative maintenance.  The majority of these fall under the requirements of replacement every seven years.  On average, these valves are 1/4 inch diameter pipe.\n\nA majority of process problems would result in a release via relief valves (estimating \u00bc inch) of approximately 6000 pounds of"

This scenario is unlikely to occur for the following reasons:  the pump is isolated with valves in the closed position and only a few pounds of ammonia would be released, the valves to the pump would have to fail completely, the facility has a prevention program in place including operational procedures that include having personnel present, with proper PPE, at all times during maintenance of a pump, a mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance of a pump is followed, routine inspections and testing of valves are conducted and the replacement of defective equipment as necessary.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed as required and comply with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RM program regulation 40 CFR: Part 68.  The prevention steps at the facility follow the PSM components:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-Start Up Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Information\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permits\n- Contractor Qualifications\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents involved with the release of ammonia at the Darien facility in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Darien Birds Eye Foods emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.119) and Hazwoper (29 C"
