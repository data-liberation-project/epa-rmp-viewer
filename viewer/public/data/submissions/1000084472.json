This detailed, critical analysis of equipment, procedures process parameters and potential deviations is used to identify opportunities for incremental safety improvements.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Procedures\r\n\r\nRmax has implemented an Emergency Action Plan that has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 29CFR 1910.38.  This plan establishes detailed evacuation, response and reporting procedures for potential facility emergencies including fire/explosions, spills, accidental releases, power failures, natural disasters, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and medical emergencies.  The Plan designates a Facility Coordinator who is responsible for implementing the plan during an emergency.  The plan also provides for emergency action procedure training for all facility personnel.  Emergency action procedures that may be implemented in the event of an accidental release of isopentane or pentane include the use of portable fire extinguishers, facility evacuation, and/or response by the appropriate local agencies.  The facility is protected from fire by an automatic sprinkler system.  The procedures in this plan have been coordinated wit the appropriate local emergency response agencies."

The raw materials used in the production of foam insulation are all liquids and are transported to the facility by truck. The raw materials are stored on-site in bulk tanks ranging in  up to 12,000 gallons, or in drums or totes.  The liquid raw materials, through the use of a series of tanks and high pressure pumps are mixed together and injected between a facer material.  Once all of the liquids are combined together in the desired proportions, they react to form a plastic foam.  Following the injection, the foam passes through a laminator heater that further solidifies and hardens the foam.   Following the laminator, the foam is cut to the desired width and length,and is stacked and packaged for shipment.  The foam insulation products, once packaged, are typically stored in a separate, on-site warehouse building for a short time, prior to their shipment to Rmax's customers.\r\n\r\nIn its manufacturing process, Rmax has the ability to use a flammable hydrocarbon, which contains isopentane (CAS #78-78-4)or normal pentane (pentane)(CAS # 109-66-0), as a blowing agent.  Isopentane and pentane are both substances that are regulated by the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Rmax maintains a supply of this hydrocarbon blowing agent in a 12,000 gallon bulk storage tank, located on-site, for use in its manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nPrevention of Accidents/Accidental Releases\r\n\r\nPrevention of accidents/accidental releases at the facility is accomplished through not only compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention provisions and other Federal and State regulations (including OSHA's Process Safety Management of"

Rmax believes its employees are an extremely valuable resource.  Employee traiaing and employee involvement are important components of its accident/accidental release prevention programs.\r\n\r\nSafe work practices are documented through the development and implementation of written operating procedures for production and maintenance personnel.  Employee training is comprehensive, focusing on proper procedures for job specific routine tasks, as well as providing an overview and awareness of the components of Rmax's Risk Masnagement Plan.  Training is provided by a competent, experienced person, and employee comprehension of training is assessed through the use of examinations.\r\n\r\nPreventive maintenance programs focus on inspection and/or testing of all process components including tanks, piping, pumps, valves, controls, instruments and safety systems.  In addition to helping ensure safe and reliable operation by maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment, the results of this program are used to identify opportunities for system improvement.\r\n\r\nNumerous safety systems and controls have been incorporated into Rmax's manufacturing process.  These include redundant pressure regulators and pressure relief devices, excess and insufficient flow detection and shutoff devices, a gas detection and monitoring system, several ventilation systems, a fire suppression system,and control of potential electrical ignition sources.. A variety of sensors and interlocks provide process control and rapid, automatic response to releases or threats of releases.  These responses include increased process/building ventilation, raw material feed shutoff, process shutdown, and activation of facility evacuation alarms.\r\n\r\nRmax has implemented a Management of Change program that requires a very detailed safety assessment and manage"
