Chlorine is purchased in ton cylinders and stored in a special chemical feed building outside the main water treatment plant. At any time, there could be as many as 6 chlorine ton cylinders in the storage room. The building contains local and remote warnings and will automatically close all bests if there is a chlorine leak.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELAEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe City of Sioux City accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and is in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program requirements.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, presence of chlorine detectors and chlorine room that will lockup if there is a chlorine leak. Also the Sioux City Fire Department HazMat team is available almost immediately.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for Chlorine is available in compliance with 29 CFR\n1910.1200. The current maximum intended inventory for chlorine is 8,000 lbs. Stored in\n4 one ton cylinders, and two one ton cylinders connected to the chlorination system.\n\nA review of the hazards associated with the chlorine facility process and procedures was performed. Documentation includes the hazards associated with chlorine and the chlorination process; the possibility of equipment malfunctions or human error, and the steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.\n\nAll equipment was inspected during the hazard review; it was determined that the chlorination facility was designed, built and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines.\n\nThe results of the hazard review were documented. The hazard review will be updated at least- once every five years. The City of Sioux City Water Tre"

Refresher training is provided yearly to each employee operating the chlorination process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures in the process. This frequency of refresher training was determined by consultation with the employees operating the process.

Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and generally good engineering practices.

The Water Plant is NOT a first responder as there are too few workers to put together an appropriate program. The local fire department HAZMAT responds to accidental chlorine releases. However an emergency response plan is maintained at the stationary source for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. This response plan contains procedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases in compliance with the local HAZMAT guidelines. The local fire department is a member of the Woodbury County Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC), and has been involved in developing a community emergency response plan. The Plant will evacuate and call 911 for HAZMAT in an emergency chlorine release.\n\nGENERAL iNFORMATION\n\nAll of these elements are in place at eh Water Plant in at least a rudimentary form. It is the intent of the City of Sioux City to again review these policies and make the necessary improvements within the next year.\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nThe topography type selected for input into the scenario analysis was urban (terrain with many obstructions).

A series of buildings lie immediately west of the treatment plant along with one building setting directly east of the Plant. The Missouri River is approximatelyl, 000 feet south of the treatment plant and 2000 feet South and Southeast of South Sioux City, Nebraska.\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS FOR WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe meteorological conditions for the worst-case are specified in the RMP regulations as follows.\n    Wind Speed-    1 .Smeters/second (3.4 miles/hour)\n    Stability Class-    F (very stable conditions)\n    Air Temperature-    25 degrees C (77 degrees F)\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE ANALYSIS\n\nThe regulations define the worst case release as a catastrophic release in which the total content of the single largest vessel onsite is released to the environment. All of the chlorine storage vessels at the Water Treatment facility are one ton cylinders. For this analysis, the cylinder was assumed to be outdoors when the release occurs.\n\nFor toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient pressure, the regulations stipulate the release time frame must be 10 minutes for the worst case scenario.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine is established by the regulation to be 0.0087 mg/L. The endpoint analysis was completed using RMP*Comp software developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At a release rate of 200 lbs. Per minute for 10 minutes directly to the environment, the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is calculated to read a radius of approximately 2.1 kilometers (1.3 miles) around the water treatment plant.\n\nThe offsite receptors were determined as follows:\nResidential Population: Siouxland Interstate Metropolitan Planning Council (SIMPCO) using the US Census Bureau LAND VIEW III mapping Program.

      "SummaryText": "7.5 minute quadrangle map for Sioux City indicates there are schools, hospitals, public recreation areas, major commercial and industrial areas located within the worst case consequence zone.\nThere are no Environmental receptors within the quadrangle of Sioux City.\nALTERNATE RELEASE ANALYSIS\n\nHazard Review: Chlorine is withdrawn at a valve near the top of the cylinder and it flows via plastic line to a gas regulator. Chlorine is withdrawn from the regulator via a vacuum and is routed to the chlorine injector through approximately 20 ft. of 5/8A? plastic tubing. If a break occurs at any location within the plastic tubing, the vacuum is lost and all chlorine flow stops. If a break occurs before the regulator, chlorine will escape until mitigation measures can be applied by emergency responders. Based upon the hazard review conduced by facility personnel, the most likely release scenario resulting in offsite consequences would be a break in the cylinder valve.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the release occurs within the chlorine storage building and that all doors are closed prior to and during a release. The release occurs from the valve located at the top of the cylinder; therefore, only chlorine in the gaseous phase is released. It is assumed the valve partially fails, creating a breach of up to 0.0276 square inches. The release rate for chlorine vapor can be calculated by the following equation provided in the EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance Manual:\n\nQR= (190) ah Where QR= release rate (pounds/minute) 190= chemical specific factor for chlorine at a tank. Pressure of 113 psi. Ah= hole area (square inches)\n\nSolving:    QR= (190) (0.0276)= 5.244 pounds per minute.\n\nThe chlorine storage building is equipped with a chlorine alarm system which will alert plant workers within 30 seconds after a release occurs.

Total time frame for emergency actions to be completed is 26 minutes.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine is established by the regulation to be a concentration of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine. The endpoint analysis was completed using the RMP*Comp software.\n\nAt a release rate of 5.244 pounds per minute, a 26 minute release would amount to a loss of 162.56 pounds of chlorine. Assuming the release is contained within the chlorine storage building, the toxic endpoint for this release is calculated to reach a radius of approximately 0.2 kilometers (0.1 mile) around the water treatment plant.\n\nThe offsite receptors were determined as follows:\nResidential population: based upon visual observation of the area included within the alternative release scenario consequence zone, there is no residential population affected. Public receptors: There is a commercial building located within the quadrangle that would be affected by a chlorine release, and no environmental receptors in the area.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of chlorine in the past five years. This accident occurred on August 28~A?, 1995. The release was small and was completely contained in the chemical feed building of the water treatment plant. No one offsite was evacuated, but seven workers at the plant were evacuated from the treatment building. HAZMAT arrived in less than five minutes from the start of the leak. Once inside the building, HAZMAT closed the valve from the tank; however, the leak actually stopped less than one minute after it began. All notification of public receptors was the responsibility of the HAZMAT team.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThere are 12 full-time workers at the plant. Because there are so few workers, the water plant will always rely on the local fire department and its HazMat team to provide emergency response."
