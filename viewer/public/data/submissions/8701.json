      "SummaryText": "The Federal-Mogul, Wiper Products (ANCO) facility in Michigan City Indiana is a world class manufacturer of windshield wiper blades.  Chlorine is used in the manufacturer of wiper blades to give the rubber windshield wiper elements a smooth finish so that they will glide smoothly over the windshield.  Chlorine is stored in (3) 2000 lb. cylinders (1 standby, 2 individually connected to the process).  The chlorine is stored in a building adjacent to the manufacturing plant were it is drawn into the process, as a gas,  and mixed with water.  Upon completion of the chlorination process, the chlorine in the water is neutralized prior to disposal.  The process contains alkaline scrubbers to remove chlorine from any process off-gas.  Because the system operates under a vacuum from the regulator to the chlorinators, the risk of a substantial chlorine release to the air is minimal.  The process is equiped with alarms and valved to enable quick isolation of various process elements in the event of an emergency.  The greatest risk of a major chlorine release is associated with the 2000 lb cylinders located in the chlorine storage building. \n\nThe worst case release, as defined by the U.S. EPA, involves the complete release, over a 10 minute period, of 2000 lb. of liquid chlorine assuming worst case weather conditions.  Under these stringent and highly unlikely conditions, computer modeling shows the potential for chlorine gas to reach the EPA toxic end-point concentration 2.2 miles from the plant.  Alternate release scenerios for the plant show the potential for chlorine gas to reach the toxic endpoint at distances between 0.2 and 0.5 miles for releases from pressure relief devices or broken-off valves, plugs or regulators respectively. Under the worst case release scenerio an estimated 14,600 people in residential, comercial/industrial, and recreational settings could be affected.  Under the alternate release scenerio, an estimated 572 people could be affected.   It is importa"

In fact, ANCO as never had a release of chlorine gas with off-site consequences. \n\nANCO is committed to the health & safety of its employees and the community.  To minimize the risks associated with the use of chlorine in its process, ANCO has taken the following steps to prevent or mitigate the consequences of an accidental release of chlorine:\n\nProcess Control\n\n   Rigorous compliance with Standards and Codes\n   Structured Hazard Analyses\n   Comprehensive Preventive Maintenance\n   Vacuum gas delivery system with regulators attached directly to chlorine cylinders\n\nOperations and Training\n\n  Documented Operating Procedures \n  Ongoing Employee Training\n  Strict Contractor Rules\n  Employee Participation and Operations Review\n\nManagement and Auditing\n\n  Management of Change Process\n  Comprehensive Incident Investigation and Corrective Action\n  Periodic Compliance Audits\n\nEmergency Response \n\n  The storage building is equiped with 24-hour chlorine and smoke sensors and alarms.\n  The facility maintains a highly trained emergency response team with Level A capability on-site.\n   Extensive emergency response equipment, including a Chlorine B-kit, is available on-site."
