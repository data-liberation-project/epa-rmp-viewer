Elements of the PSM program include evergreen and actively maintained written operating procedures that are followed by trained and knowledgeable technicians.\r\n \r\nOver time, MEMC has built a collection of detailed process safety procedures to insure standardized chemical handling and usage. The procedures begin with a safety section to reinforce the main theme of \"Safety First\".  Management Of Change is formally controlled in covered processes to ensure that no unauthorized changes occur.  Job Safety Analyses or Risk Assessments are also used as applicable, to identify hazards, and control risks.  These are step-by-step reviews of tasks to ensure these jobs are done according to the safety standard.\r\n\r\nPrevention steps include:\r\n+ Tank and vessel inspection program to check mechanical integrity\r\n+ Safety relief valve test program to ensure equipment functions as designed\r\n+ Process Line Entry Permit for servicing piping and equipment and returning it to service\r\n+ Hot Work Permits, Fire Prevention Plans, and related procedures\r\n+ Sprinkler systems and firewalls to minimize the threat of fire or explosion\r\n\r\nMEMC measures the Serious Incident Rate for the plant each month, to include all accidents and incidents and potential incidents, not simply injuries.  Those classified as Serious Incidents are formally investigated, and tracked in a Corrective Action Request system.  Safety work order and safety suggestion programs provide all employees with t"

That emergency number is also posted on all plant telephones.  The Hotline and the plant's emergency alarms go to the security desk in the main lobby.  The security officers activate the site Emergency Response Team paging system and will summon other plant resources, including Central County Fire and Rescue when needed.\r\n\r\nThe response is handled by the plant's Emergency Response Team, and Central County Fire and Rescue when necessary.  MEMC ERT members are 40-hour HazWoper trained and given refresher training annually.  Emergency Medical Responder training has also been provided. Periodically, MEMC's ERT and Central County Fire and Rescue review emergency responses and plans, and conduct joint training exercises.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency with off-site consequences, MEMC would work with Central County Fire and Rescue.
