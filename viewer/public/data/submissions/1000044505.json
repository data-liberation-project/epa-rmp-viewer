The WTP is located approximately 2 miles west of Mount Vernon, WA directly adjacent to the Skagit River.  The WTP operates continuously 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  A key treatment process at the WTP is water disinfection using chlorine.  Chlorine is the chemical used at the WTP that is subject to federal Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.\r\nThe form of chlorine used is liquefied gaseous chlorine that is stored and fed on-site from 1-ton cylinders.  The chlorine system is housed in a dedicated room within the WTP Chemical Building that is used for chlorine storage and feed only.  Up to 18 cylinders can be stored within the room.  Chlorine cylinder deliveries typically occur about once per week. The feed system consists of two banks of 3 on-line cylinders each, from which gas chlorine is withdrawn under vacuum to up to 4 vacuum chlorinators which control the rate of gas chlorine feed to up to 4 injection points into carrier water streams that convey the chlorine to the feed points for the disinfection process.  \r\nThe chlorine room is an H-3 Occupancy area per the International Building Code (IBC) and therefore has appropriate ventilation and conditioning, fire-rated walls and assemblies, and fire sprinkler system.  There are 4 chlorine gas detectors in the room that are continuously monitored.  An emergency dry-type chlorine scrubber unit is located directly adjacent to the chlorine room that is designed to neutralize up to 2000 lbs. of chlorine gas.  All 6 on-line cylinders have emergency shut-off valves that are activated when chlorine gas is detected anywhere in the chlorine room. \r\n2\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nThe City of Anacortes is fully committed to the lowest"

The dry scrubber system operates as designed (active mitigation). The release rate is based on an assumed orifice  in the vapor space of the cylinder.

This scenario reflects conditions under which a release would be more likely to occur.\r\n4\tFive-Year Accident History \r\nPer the RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as the release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in-place, property damage, or environmental damage\".  There have been no chlorine release events at the Anacortes WTP in the past five years that meet any of these criteria.\r\n5\tPrevention Program Elements\r\nProgram Management.  Roles and responsibilities for implementing and carrying-out the RM Program for the City's WTP are defined within the City's organization.  The Public Works Director has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RM Program, including the assignment of the specific RM Program roles and responsibilities for the Assistant City Engineer for Water and the WTP staff.  The WTP Manager is responsible for the integration, execution, and enforcement of the RM Program at the WTP.  \r\nProcess Safety Information.

A PHA was performed for the WTP chlorine system using the What-If Checklist Method in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.67.  The hazards analysis scenarios were divided into the following categories:\r\n1.\tO&M Hazards\r\n2.\tEquipment Failure / Malfunction Hazards\r\n3.\tExternal / Environmental Hazards\r\nIssues identified in the PHA were documented and have been addressed.  The PHA will be reevaluated and updated as necessary once every five years or more often if new hazards are identified.\r\nOperating Procedures.  Operating procedures for the chlorine system are documented in the WTP electronic O&M Manual.  These procedures are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. \r\nTraining.  All new operators at the WTP receive initial training in chlorine system operations, safety, and emergency response.  All WTP operators receive refresher training annually.\r\nMechanical Integrity.  The mechanical integrity program for the WTP chlorine system includes the following:\r\n&#9679;\tIdentification of critical equipment and instrumentation.\r\n&#9679;\tWritten maintenance, testing, and inspection schedules and procedures.\r\n&#9679;\tMaintenance personnel training.\r\n&#9679;\tMaintenance, testing, and inspection completion and documentation.\r\n&#9679;\tCorrection of equipment deficiencies.\r\n&#9679;\tQuality assurance of new equipment.\r\nManagement of Change.

A Pre-startup Safety Review (PSSR) will be performed if and when modifications to the existing chlorine process at the WTP are made that are significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that the modified chlorine system is ready to safely operate.\r\nCompliance Safety Audits.  RMProgram compliance will be confirmed by compliance safety audits performed at least once every 3 years in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.81.  Documentation of the audit findings is included in the compliance audit report.  All deficiencies and/or recommendations noted in the audit are addressed and the resolutions of them are also documented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are maintained electronically in City files.\r\nIncident Investigation.  A procedure for chlorine release incident investigation, reporting, and documentation has been prepared in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.81.  This procedure applies to all incidents that result in and all near-miss incidents that could have resulted in catastrophic chlorine releases.  A catastrophic release is one that injures or endangers employees, the public, or the environment.  A near-miss is an incident that could have resulted in a catastrophic release but was averted either due to rapid observation and response actions or good fortune (e.g., favorable wind conditions, operators being out of the area, etc.) which cannot routinely be counted on in the future.

A Hot Work Permit procedure has been developed for hot work conducted on or near the chlorine system in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.85.  Hot work is defined as any work that may generate a source of ignition and includes but is not limited to welding, torch cutting, and use of spark-producing equipment.  This procedure does not apply to work performed in established maintenance shops or areas at the WTP that are designated for hot work.\r\nContractor Safety.  A Contractor Safety procedure has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.85.  This procedure covers evaluating contractor's health and safety information before selection and evaluating contractor safety performance while working at the WTP. This procedure is specific to those contractors who perform work (e.g., maintenance or repair, renovation, or specialty work) on and around the chlorine system in the WTP Chemical Building.\r\n6\tEmergency Response\r\nEmergency response procedures for chlorine releases at the WTP are documented in the Emergency Response Plan.  The Plan addresses the key responsibilities and actions for: 1) emergency response preparation, and 2) immediate response and mitigation of a serious chlorine gas release that may result in a risk to human life and health safety.  Typically, a serious chlorine release is defined as that which releases or has the potential to release 10 lbs. or more of chlorine.  It is not intended to address small incidental chlorine releases that can occur as part of routine operations at the WTP that are easily mitigated without any life and health safety risk.\r\nEmergency Response Planning.  A key element of emergency response preparation is the WTP Chlorine Emergency Response Team (CERT).
