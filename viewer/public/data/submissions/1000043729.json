If an accidental release were to occur involving the ammonia storage system, Nachurs would immediately notify the Harrison County Sheriff's Department, who would respond to the emergency.  Nachurs has a Chemical Evacuation Plan which would be followed.  The Plan provides for sheltering in place or evacuation as directed by the scene commander.  Employees are equipped with radios to maintain communications.\n\n\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe Nachurs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use. The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia. The ammonia storage process consists of above ground storage tanks and associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe Nachurs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law using materials approved for use with aqua ammonia.  As an administrative control, tanks are only filled to 90% capacity.  The ammonia storage tanks are located within 40\" high dike walls.  The aqua system is visually inspected daily, it is fully inspected annually by the Maintenance Department and it is inspected every five years by an engineer.  The thicknesses of the tanks are measured every five years by an engineer.  Tankers being unloaded are equipped with an emergency shut-off valve.  Employees are trained in the proper procedures for storing and handli"
