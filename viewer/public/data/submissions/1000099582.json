Management commitment is demonstrated by policies, procedures, modeling safe work behaviors and seeking out employee ideas to improve safety.  The plant has compiled an RMP manual that describes how RMP requirements are met, includes current version procedures, and references other safety provisions that overlap with RMP.  Additionally, the plant has a site-specific Emergency Action Plan that describes actions taken to address a wide variety of potential site emergencies (e.g., fire, evacuation, severe weather, hazardous substance releases).  \n\nThe plant takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of chemicals.  Employees are regularly trained in these procedures and the documents are periodically reviewed and updated when changes occur.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nBlack Dog Generating Plant is an electric generating plant that utilizes natural gas-fired simple and combined cycle generating technology.  As part of the combined-cycle technology, the facility uses 29% aqueous ammonia solution, which is regulated under the RMP rule and qualifies for Program 2 requirements.  The ammonia is used for flue gas treatment and is stored in a 20,000-gallon storage tank.  The tank is located indoors and has containment diking for 110% of the tank capacity.  The outdoor ammonia tanker unloading area is also equipped with concrete secondary containment.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Aqueous Ammonia\n\nThe prevention program is described in the Black Dog Generating Plant RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n?    Safety Information is collected and summarized in the RMP manual.\n\n?    Hazard Review - an initial hazard review for the ammonia system was conducted in Febr"

Revalidations of the hazard review have been completed every 5 years, and modifications to the system receive appropriate hazard review.  \n\n?    Operating procedures for the ammonia system are available in the RMP manual.  They are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n?    Initial training was conducted for personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia system and refresher training is provided a minimum of every 3 years.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work independently on the system.\n\n?    Maintenance program - the plant work management software program is used to schedule and track preventive maintenance (e.g., inspections, calibration) to ensure system equipment is maintained in good, safe working condition.\n\n?    Incident investigation for catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the ammonia system, would use the company incident investigation procedure.\n\n?    Compliance audits are conducted every three years to ensure continued compliance of the facility's ammonia system RMP program.  \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nThe RMP rule requires the accident history for the five-year period prior to the submittal of this Risk Management Plan.  The ammonia system was installed in 2002 and there have been no accidents meeting reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with city and county response agencies.  The program is described in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP manual and meets the requirement of the RMP rule applicable to OSHA HAZWOPER non-responding facilities.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases to the public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect "
