ONEOK\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ulysses Truck Facility is owned and operated by ONEOK NGL Pipeline, L.P.  At the facility, demethanized product is received via trucks and injected into a pipeline to be sent out to gas liquids fractionators for further processing.  There are two 30,000-gallon storage bullets at the facility containing demethanized product.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances contained in the demethanized product are ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane.  These are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  There are no RMP toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.

The Area Supervisor is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methods used to perform Hazard Reviews serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00bfThe Safety Information and Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u00bfInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u00bfAn ongoing dialogue with the Grant County Emergency Managemen"
