In addition, we have had no complaints from area residents.  We feel this has been accomplished by a rigid maintenance program on both the stoage facility and the application equipment.  We also provide training to all our employees who are involved in the operation of the facility.  These employees in turn are qualified to inspect customer owned appplication equipment as well as instructing end users on proper handling.  Our company has also hired an independent Safety and Health Director to provide regular facility inspections and employee training sessions.  These training sessions remind our employees of the preventitive maintenance needed and the proper response to an emergency.  We are coordinated with the local emergency management department, also.  In the remote case of any hose leak, or complete loss of product from our largest container, we are prepared to handle the situation as safely for everyone as possible."
