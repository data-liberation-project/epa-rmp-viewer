Edwards Chemicals, Inc. is a chemical distribuitor to municipalities and industries as well as being a custodial product distribuitor to municipalities, industry and school districts.   Our facility is located at 515 Middleton Street, Saint Joseph, MO  64505.  The toxic chemical that is stored witin our facility is that of chlorine in 150# cylinders.  The most that is stored at any given point is 70 cylinders or 10,500#'s.  We are dedicated to the safety our our employees and our community, as well as those communities we service.  We are continually training our staff on the proper procedures and protocol for handling chemicals.  We have requested and received onsite consulatation in the last 12 months from the Missouri Department of Labor, Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the local Fire Marshall, to audit our policies, procedures and programs as well as an unscheduled on-site inspection by our insurance carrier. We are proud that during these consultations no major itmes were noted and that all suggestions by these agencies have been put into place, with proper training given to our staff.  A site hazard assessment was completed on May 17th, 2002 and noted items have been addressed and/or corrected.  The management of Edwards Chemicals, Inc. in dedicated to the safety programs instituited by our Safety Administrator, and management is apprised of all safety issues at weekly management meetings. In the event of a gas chlorine release on-site, we have been listed in the Buchanan County LEPC emergency plan and have trained our staff how to detect a leak and how to evacuate the builidng and contact the LEPC as well as our emergency response contractor A&M Enviromental Response.
