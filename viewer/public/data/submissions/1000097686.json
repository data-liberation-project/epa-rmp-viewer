The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for Winona propane terminal is coordinated with the Coconino County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination will include periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Winona propane terminal will institute any necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials similar to those already in place for contacting the local fire department. This will provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Winona propane terminal conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization. The Winona propane terminal facility also currently holds periodic meetings with local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substances handled by the propane terminal facility and the location of emergency shutoffs and equipment.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Winona Propane Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Winona Propane Terminal."

      "SummaryText": "ion, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Winona Propane Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Winona Propane Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Winona Propane Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\n\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n* Excess flow valves on loading hoses.\r\n* Atmospheric relief devices.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \r\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, flame retardant coveralls, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \r\n\r\nEmergency Procedures Information\r\n\r\nThe Winona Propane Terminal maintains a written emergency procedu"

The terminal operator is responsible for the hookup, unloading and disconnection of supply rail cars.  The operator also assists with the proper tare weighing, loading and full weighing of transport trucks that fill up at the terminal, and with coordinating the removal of empty rail cars and the delivery of full cars as the propane transfer demand requires.\r\n\r\nThe process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nThe Winona Propane Terminal facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on the known volumes of the storage tanks and supply rail cars. The only listed flammable substance which is stored above the threshold quantity at the Winona Propane Terminal facility is odorized propane.  \r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Winona Propane Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.
