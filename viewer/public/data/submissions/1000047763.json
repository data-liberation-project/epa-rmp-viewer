In order to reduce NOx air emissions, Sammis installed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on units 6&7 back in 2009.  This system removes NOx by catalytically reacting NOx with Ammonia to form Nitrogen and water vapor.  The process is covered by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rules due to the presence of 29 % Aqueous Ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe covered process includes:  rail car unloading, tank truck unloading, storage, and SCR feed.  There are six storage tanks that may contain up to 57,000 gallons each (95% capacity).  There is also an emergency truck unloading and feed station.\n\n \n\nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe Sammis process is considered a Program 2 site by RMP rules.  However, FirstEnergy has chosen to implement additional elements of a Program 3 site.  Sammis uses a management of change and pre-startup safety review procedure as well conducting a compliance audit every three years following EPA guidelines.\n\n\n\nProcess protections are primarily those measures that will reduce, prevent or minimize a release from happening or, if it did happen, minimize the consequences of that threat.    These include:\n\n\n\nTraining on operations, emergencies etc;\n\n   -Operators of the systems covered by the RMP plan have refresher training at least every 3 years.\n\nRegular maintenance/SOPS;        \n\nDuring deliveries, attendance by the operator is continuous until the delivery is complete;\n\nNo rail cars or tank trucks stored on site other than those in the process of being unloaded;\n\nOnsite wireless communication;\n\nOnsite trucks/vehicles for emergency transportation needs;   \n\nFire extinguishers; \n\nAmmonia monitors/detectors/alarms;\n\nMain feed pump flow alarms/detector\n\nHigh level tank alarms with interlock shutoffs  \n\nSecondary containment;         \n\n   -Underground vault large enough to contain the largest r"

Some of these standards include ASME code for process piping, B31.3, and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code, Section VIII.   \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nThere is a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County LEPC and the local fire departments.  Selected site response personnel are Hazwoper trained.    \n\n\n\nEmergency response planning has long been an integral part of operations at Sammis.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard, and Ohio EPA have required the site to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters, storms, exposure to releases or harm/damage resulting from potentially flammable or explosive materials.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIn response to the 5 year RMP review and revalidation, the following action items are planned to be conducted by First Energy.\n\n \n\nSince both the ASME code for process piping, B31.3 and the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code, Section VIII have been recently updated since the primary engineering evaluation for the storage tanks and piping was conducted in 2009, First Energy plans to conduct an engineering evaluation"
