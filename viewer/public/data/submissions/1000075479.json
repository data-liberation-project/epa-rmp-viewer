      "SummaryText": "The North Crossett Gas Plant is located approximately 4.5 miles west of McCamey, TX in Upton County.  The North Crossett plant is designed to separate the feed gas into marketable natural gas liquids, pipeline quality natural gas and CO2 for re-injection.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency\r\n\r\nOccidental Permian, Ltd's. N Crossett Gas Plant (NCGP) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, NCGP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nProcess Overview\r\n\r\nThe McCamey North Crossett Plant is a gas processing and compression facility located West of McCamey, TX in Upton County.  The plant processes several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.  Gas produced from the North Cross Field flows through the Central Battery for liquid/gas separation, then on to the plant for separation of CO2, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and sales gas.\r\nApproximately 9 mmcfd of low pressure (80 psig) inlet gas and 15 mmcfd of high pressure (200 psig) inlet gas is compressed with 4 GMV compressors, and then processed through a TEG Dehydration system to remove water.  A portion this gas is directed through a stabilizer unit which uses a Freon refrigeration system to chill and drop out NGLs.  The remainder of the gas is again compressed with booster compressors and directed into a membrane unit for additional NGLs reco"

An additional stream of high pressure gas from the Central battery (6 mmcfd) is compressed through a rental compressor, dried through a desiccant system and also treated at the membrane unit.\r\nRecovered liquids are trucked out and sold, approximately 2.6 mmcfd of the membrane methane gas is collected and sold and the CO2 separated out by the process is compressed through the station 4 compressors and re-injected into the field. \r\n\r\nRMP Overview\r\n\r\nThe North Crossett Gas Plant qualifies as a Program Level 1 facility due to the presence of methane, the absence of any accidents during the previous 5 years and the lack of impact on any off-site receptors from the covered process resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  North Crossett Gas Plant is not required to have a specific prevention program; however, we do have an active Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which incorporates accidental release prevention. \r\nNorth Crossett Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provide first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, and notification of emergency response agencies.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety\r\n\r\n1.\tWe will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing NCGP incidents.\r\n2.\tWe will continue to develop and share management practice involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental Plants.\r\n3.\tWe will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\r\n\r\nCertification\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the"

      "SummaryText": "distance to the specific endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\r\nWithin the past five years the NCGP process has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in 40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of the regulated substance for the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.
