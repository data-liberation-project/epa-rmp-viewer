Given the safety and accident history of this facility it is believed that no other extensive modeling is necessary.\n\n\nSECTION IV & V\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has no flammables subject to RMP therefore, no scenarios are submitted.\n\n\nSECTION VII\n\nThe Lake Linganore WTP has an excellent safety record having had no accidental releases in its 7 year history.\n\n\nSECTION VIII\n\nWhat-If & What-If/Checklists are used to update the PHA.  The last PHA was completed for this report on May 1999.  Many of the hazards identified are extremely remote yet are possible and were, therefore, listed for this report.   The What-If scenarios include environmental emergencies, human failures, power failures, and computer and equipment failure.  A Y2K review has been completed for potential impact on this facility.  This facility is not run 24 hours per day and it is unlikely that Y2K problems will have  significant impact.  In the event that Y2K causes a power failure or other equipment malfunction, standby personnel are planned for and backup equipment is also available.\n\nFrederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has built redundancy into many of its critical processes.  This redundancy includes dual power and generators for power failures, duplicate pumps, controls, and sensors for other equipment.  Audible and visual alarms and procedures are in place for routine and emergency process control.  Automatic controls and shutoffs are equipped with manual backups in the event of power failures or other emergencies cause equipment failure.  \n \nChlorine containers are stored in a room separate from the rest of the treatment area in the South West Corner of the Building.  This building is not ventilated to the outside and any release would be contained in the facility.

This program has set the benchmark for many other Frederick County Department of  Public Works safety programs.

Currently these policies include the following: \n\n\t \tPPE\n\t \tHazard Communication (RTK)\n\t \tEmergency Action and Fire Prevention and Extinguisher Use\n\t \tChlorine Safety & Chlorine Repair Kit A & B\n\t \tEmergency Response to Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Releases\n\t \tBloodborne Pathogens & First Aid / CPR\n\t \tAtmospheric Testing & Respiratory Protection\n\t \tConfined Space \n\t \tLock Out / Tag Out (LOTO)\n\t \tSafe Lifting\n\t \tFork Lift Safety\n\nReview of all policies is ongoing with a formal review once per year. Formal review was completed for RMP submission.  An on-the-job training program is being implemented using both health & safety training and job performance check-lists for job performance evaluation.\n\nAn active employee safety committee is included in policy review.  The committee also conducts facility inspections on a periodic basis.\n\nFrederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has implemented a Computerized Maintenance Management System for tracking of equipment maintenance both routine and repairs.  This system allows for faster retrieval  of tracking data, planning schedules for preventive maintenance, and resource (man-hours, parts and equipment) tracking.  This system is still in the implementation stage and, therefore, hard copy  maintenance logs are still in use for some areas and equipment.\n\n\nSECTION IX\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer is a Frederick County agency and works closely with other Frederick County agencies to maintain its Emergency Response.

      "SummaryText": "FREDERICK COUNTY BUREAU OF WATER AND SEWER\n\tLAKE LINGANORE WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\t\n\tRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSECTION I\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer owns and operates several water treatment plants (WTP) in Frederick County Maryland.  This facility is located at the end of Quinn Road at Lake Linganore Dam and is the second largest WTP operated by Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer. The Lake Linganore WTP treats about 1 mgd and serves 33,000 residential customers and commercial /industrial customers.   Chlorine, liquid or gas, is the primary disinfectant used at water treatment facilities in the United States.  Fourteen  thousand pounds of Chlorine is the maximum amount at this facility.  There are no other hazardous chemical used or stored above reportable quantities at this facility.  There has never been a release of Chlorine at this facility. This facility is one of two Bureau of Water and Sewer facilities required to submit RMP data; therefore, much of the data contained in this report will be similar or the same for both facilities. \n\n\nSECTION II & III\n\nBoth relief scenarios used in this report use a single container 2,000 lbs.  With the policies and procedures in place and the safety record of this facility, it is believed that this is the greatest amount that would be released in a single incident. \n\nThe first scenario  is a Chlorine gas release taking place over a 10 minute period.  This 10 minute period is the estimated time that it would take for sensors to sound the alarm, personnel response with appropriate PPE and equipment, and valve or line repair or seal. \n\nThe second scenario is a rupture of a fusible plug (relief valve) with the total contents of one container emptied in an eight minute period of time. This time frame is based on the size of the fusible plug and the emptying of the complete container.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp  software and the Off  Site"
