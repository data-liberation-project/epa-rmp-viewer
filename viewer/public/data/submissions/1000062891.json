This is accomplished by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available. The Authority's prevented maintenance program includes:\n\n\n\n1)      Analysis of the scrubber media tested twice per year, verification the scrubber neutralization    capacity for chlorine.\n\n2)    The Halogen eclipse automatic shutoff valves are annually factory tested. \n\n3)    Gas detectors are tested weekly. \n\n4)    Chlorine zinc plated flexible connectors replaced yearly.\n\n\n\nOperating and maintenance procedures are reviewed annually and are officially approved as the accepted operating procedures. \n\nPersonnel are annually trained on operation and maintenance procedures. \n\nThe Stationary Source for Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) remains the same since the original RMP 1999\n\n\n\nSturgeon Point Worst -Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst-case Scenario was completed for 2017 (using the RMP*Comp and Marplot) with a radius of 1.3  miles for a rural area. The Alternative Release Scenario was completed for 2017 (using the RMP*Comp and Marplot) with radius of .4 miles for a rural area.  \n\n\n\nSturgeon Point\n\nThe Fire Chief and volunteers of the Highland Hose Volunteer Fire Company, Evans NY  annually reviews and  inspects the Sturgeon Point treatment plant last visit October 2016\n\n\n\nSturgeon Point Maintenance Updates 2015-2016\n\n1) Chlorine detector located in the cylinder supply area was relocated closer in the cylinders\n\n2) Crane stops on the chlorine crane were re-position to avoid crane from contacting chlorine piping.\n\n3) Erie County Emergency Services requested signs posting for Empty and Full cylinders in chlorine supply.\n\n4) Standardize on opening cylinder valves using a 6\" twisted wrench approved by chlorine institute.\n\n5) A detail procedure on replacing chlorin"
