Industrial Avenue borders the facility to the east, Foothills Blvd. to the west and Blue Oaks Blvd. to the north. The facility maintains approximately 320 full time employees.  The facility produces and stores grocery products for regional distribution to retail stores. The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop ?Direct? type system. \r\n\r\nAlbertsons LLC ?s Roseville, Ca facility has developed a risk management program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR1910.119) and to enhance an already existing safety and emergency actions program.  Albertsons LLC is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Albertsons staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTIONAND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nAlbertsons LLC?s Roseville, CA facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems. Policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe ammonia systems are composed of the following key components:\r\n\r\n2 Condensers\r\nThermosyphon Vessel\r\nHigh (Constant) Pressure Receiver\r\n2 Accumulators\r\n3 Oil Pots\r\n6 Compressors\r\n27 Evaporator Groups \r\n3 Dump Tanks\r\n\r\nSystem operation cycle begins at the high pressure receiver where liquid ammonia"

At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature and is pumped to the evaporators where it absorbs heat from the room. Vapor is returned to the pump receiver and accumulator from the evaporators where the gas is separated from the liquid and liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver via the liquid ammonia transfer system.  The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the RMP and CalARP regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (given that the ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of interconnected equipment) we used the high pressure receiver releasing 11,500 pounds in 10.0 minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, no portions of the ammonia refrigeration system are located outside, however no credit was taken for containment. The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the RMP and Cal ARP regulations. ALOHA (areal locations of hazardous atmospheres) was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm. The results show that offsite areas will be affected. This WCS is highly unlikely to occur because of the active mitigation measures that can be taken.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\n\r\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor as a result of an ammonia reli"

For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is 150 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. ALHOA was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 150 ppm. The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\n\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potential reach the community: the Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over predict the effects of a potential release other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\r\n\r\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\r\n- Floor drains in the engine room would provide containment for liquid release and therefore minimize the potential for off-site impact.  \r\n- Although most of the ammonia is located in the engine room. Conservatively, no credit for enclosure mitigation was taken.\r\n- Plant personnel, as necessary use personnel protective equipment (PPE).\r\n- The history of the facility reflect the"

Approximately 390 lbs of ammonia vapor was released over a period of 14 hours and 15 minutes due to a mechanical failure.
