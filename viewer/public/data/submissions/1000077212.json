The POLYOX plant was included in previous UCC RPM plan and as a result of the companies spin off, Specialty Products US, LLC is submitting a separate RMP plan.  \r\n\r\nInstitute Site\r\nThe Institute Site is an Industrial Park owned by Union Carbide Corporation with several manufacturing facility tenants producing specialty chemical products.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nSpecialty Products is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nSpecialty Products is a manufacturing facility that produces specialty chemical products.  Most products are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products. \r\n\r\nSpecialty Products currently handles and stores threshold quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals at this site.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nSpecialty Products at the Institute site has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

Examples include, but are not limited to, Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and reactive chemicals test results.  This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPs), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nSpecialty Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
