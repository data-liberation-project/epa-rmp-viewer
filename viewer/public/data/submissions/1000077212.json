The POLYOX plant owned by Specialty Products US, LLC was formally owned by Union Carbide Corporation (UCC EPA Facility ID 10000061381).  The POLYOX plant was included in previous UCC RPM plan and as a result of the companies spin off, Specialty Products US, LLC is submitting a separate RMP plan.  \n\n\n\nInstitute Site\n\nThe Institute Site is an Industrial Park owned by Union Carbide Corporation with several manufacturing facility tenants producing specialty chemical products.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nSpecialty Products is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nSpecialty Products is a manufacturing facility that produces specialty chemical products.  Most products are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products. \n\n\n\nSpecialty Products currently handles and stores threshold quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals at this site.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nSpecialty Products at the Institute site has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no significant releases with offsite impact as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nSpecialty Products general "

Key elements include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  Examples include, but are not limited to, Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and reactive chemicals test results.  This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPs), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nSpecialty Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nSpecialty Products facility requires management of modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than \"like for like\", by identifying, documenting, and reviewing them prior to implementation of changes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training prior to the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are conducted using established schedules and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSpecialty Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or "
