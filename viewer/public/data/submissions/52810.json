Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA formal process is established to help ensure that potential hazards associated with the various facility processes are identified and controlled.  Within this process, PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The HAZard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date. \n\nE.  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Sweeny Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nF.

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is periodically reviewed and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. \n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Sweeny Refinery is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Sweeny Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  Periodic emergency drills are conducted that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations.  In addition to the LEPC, the Sweeny Refinery also has a Mutual Aid System in place, the Emergency Assistance Agreement Committee (EAAC) which is a sub committee of the Industrial CAER organization in the Brazosport area. This system provides Mutual Aid from other industry members in the Brazosport area.  Also, the Brazoria Volunteer Fire Department and West Brazos Emergency Medical Services would provide assistance in the event of an emergency at the Sweeny Refinery. The EAAC conducts emergency drills quarterly each year, hosted by a facility with other member facilities participating.\n\n\nVII.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nSweeny Refinery maintains written Emergency Response Procedures and Action Plans to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first?aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post?incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Sweeny Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is periodically reviewed and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. \r\n\r\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Sweeny Refinery is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Sweeny Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  Periodic emergency drills are conducted that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations.  In additio"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nJ.  Management of Change\n\nSweeny Refinery has developed written procedures to manage changes to covered processes.  These procedures require that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and changes to facilities that may affect a covered process, are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Hazard reviews are conducted to verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated as necessary to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nK.  Incident Investigation\n\nThe Sweeny Refinery has established a formal incident reporting and investigation process to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, chemical release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
