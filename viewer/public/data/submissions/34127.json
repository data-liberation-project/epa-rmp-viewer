      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Louis Trauth Dairy are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Newport Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the storage and distribution of products for our many retail outlets.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n \n4. The Accidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requi"
