Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) interprets this regulation as any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\r\n\r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedu"

The Duty Manager are to be called if not on site for support.  Releases less than 50 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Duty Manager, if not on site, for instructions.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review SCR process equipment on an ongoing basis.  These procedures identify potential sources of releases and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite technicians, registered engineers, SCR process experts, and certified process contractors review the equipment as required.\r\n\r\nThere are full time managers and operational employees such as technicians at this facility that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) prevention program.  \r\n\r\n (b) STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) facility at 73396 Tower Road, Boardman, OR., utilizes anhydrous ammonia for NOx emission reduction. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may displace oxygen. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeat or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, serious skin burn, and even death.  Safety Data Sheet's (SDS) are provided for anhydrous ammonia in the appendix. The SDS provides information on; toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical data, r"

All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) management.

(Addressed under Operating Procedures, Maintenance, and Incident Investigation Elements.) \r\n\r\n4) Certification of process operators (technicians) to safely operate the SCR process. Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) certifies technicians following completion of qualification training and Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station)'s confirmation of the technician's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\r\n\r\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.

These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station)'s program.\r\n \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for a change in maintenance contracts, Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the ammonia system, a Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) Hot Work permit is required.

These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as SDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" checklist.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Technical Operating Specifications\r\nThe Technical Operating Specifications (TOS) made up of the process safety information and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) are provided for the process equipment.

Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the RMP/PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\r\n\r\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and the LEPC.\r\n\r\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\r\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done. The management reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\r\n\r\nContractors and Contractor Qualifications\r\nThis site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process.  The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the SCR process, that contractors understand their responsibility"

All areas (zones) can reasonably be brought under control within 20 minutes of an ammonia emergency if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area, the SCR process may be shut down if appropriate at the DCS control computer.  \r\n\r\nPortland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) technicians are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and ammonia specific, stationary and portable air monitoring equipment, decontamination, clean up and disposal.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Regulations considered while developin"
