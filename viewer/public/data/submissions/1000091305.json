The high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condenser and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receiver is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receiver contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlooded Accumulators\r\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal ofheat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pres"

The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia. \r\n\r\nSafety Systems\r\n\r\nAmmonia Detection System\r\nThe machinery room is equipped with a Cool Air LBW-50 ammonia detector, while Rooms 1-8 and the Shipping Dock (Room 9) are equipped with a Sherlock sensor that is connected to a Genesis International, Inc. module in the Palletizing Area. Each detector/sensor provides ammonia detection and alerts facility personnel in the event of an ammonia release. \r\n\r\nEmergency Control Box\r\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) is installed on the north wall of the machinery room and contains three (3) valves.\r\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\r\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\r\nValve #3: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\r\nOpening Valve #1 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system.

The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere.

The switch can be activated in an emergency using the key.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in or"

These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Corona-College Heights Citrus facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nCorona-College Heights Citrus has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nCorona-College Heights Citrus's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Ti"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCorona-College Heights Citrus has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Corona-College Heights Citrus continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Corona-College Heights Citrus's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Corona-College Heights Citrus's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\nCorona-College Heights Citrus has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be"
