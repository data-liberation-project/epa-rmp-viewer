This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers equipment design, installation, operating procedures, preventive maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the Pineville plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes the management system that documents these activities. \n\n\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with Senior Management.  Senior Management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried on at all levels of the plant.  The success of the plant?s HES program is also demonstrated by a strong commitment to safety by our employees and site contractors. \n\n\n\nOdor-Tech LLC?s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials to ensure our commitment to health, environment, and safety.

This facility currently receives, stores, blends and ships various natural gas odorants.  Ethyl Mercaptan, which is received, stored and shipped at the facility is a regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  Ethyl Mercaptan is used as a propane gas odorizer and it can also be used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and pesticides.  \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT TOXIC WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe Odor-Tech LLC Pineville facility does not handle any toxic substances that are regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.\n\n\n\nFLAMMABLE WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic failure of an Ethyl Mercaptan storage tank.  It is stored as a liquid.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan stored to 85 % to the tank liquid capacity.  This quantity (106,000 pounds) is assumed to be released over a 10 minute time period as a vapor.  Hazard assessment data indicates that, under worst-case conditions, the potentially affected area is a maximum distance of 0.32 miles, which corresponds to end point distance of a 1psi over pressure.  Again, it is noted that the worst-case scenario is an extremely unlikely event and Odor-Tech LLC has implemented mitigation and prevention programs to reduce the likelihood of a worst case incident from occurring.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURE \n\n\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures are currently in use at the Pineville plant make it very unlikely that a significant release involving Ethyl Mercaptan would occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Odor"

      "SummaryText": "-Tech LLC has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential impacts to the community. \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines used to define worst-case incidents, active mitigation measures were not considered in modeling the worst-case scenarios.  However, the significant mitigation measures will effectively reduce the risk and consequences associated with a RMP worst-case incident.  Mitigation measures include:\n\n\n\n?    Containment Dikes.\n\n\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n\n\n?    Integrated Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT TOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n\n\n\nThe Odor-Tech LLC Pineville facility does not handle toxic substances that are regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS MITIGATION MEASURES\n\n\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenario is, by definition, more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, it is still very unlikely to occur due to the facility?s existing release and accident prevention program.  If a release should occur, Odor-Tech LLC has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact.  The alternate release case involved a partial rupture of a liquid hose during unloading a transportation container.  The prevention program elements in place at Pineville are:\n\n\n\n?    Emergency Shutdown Systems - Remote operated valves to isolate the storage tanks in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n\n\n?    Trained operators on-site.\n\n\n\n?    Dikes\n\n\n\n?    Planned Inspection Programs\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Odor-Tech LLC Pineville plant has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The accident prevention program includes the following elements "
