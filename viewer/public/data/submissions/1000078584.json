Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nThis facility handles Liquefied Petroleum Gases (propane, isobutane and normal butane, difluorethane) that are considered hazardous by the EPA.  These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Aeropres Corporation will strictly adhere to all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  Safety depends on:\r\n(a) The manner in which we handle these products;\r\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility;\r\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures, and \r\n(d) Employee training\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the local LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors.  Response activities are coordinated with the Manhattan Fire Department at telephone number 815.478.3771.  The most recent review of the Facility's emergency response program was completed on June 14, 2012, and the most recent emergency response training for the Facility's employees was completed on February 25, 2011.  \r\n\r\n2.  The Facility and Regulated Substances handled:\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to:\r\n(a) Receive and store Liquefied Petroleum Gases, Difluoroethane;\r\n(b) Remove trace contaminants\r\n(c) Blend these products to customer specifications; and\r\n(d) Ship the finished products to our customers via truck and rail.\r\nOur customers use this product as propellant in aerosols.
