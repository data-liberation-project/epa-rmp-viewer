      "SummaryText": "Tharaldson Ethanol Plant I, LLC (Tharaldson Ethanol) owns and operates an ethanol plant in Casselton, Cass County, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The facility has the annual capacity to produce up to 124 million gallons of anhydrous ethanol.  The plant generates fuel grade ethanol primarily for blending with gasoline and other motor fuels.  The process of natural fermentation of corn is the primary means of producing ethanol.  This site process also produces distiller?s dried grains for use as animal feed.\n\nTharaldson Ethanol is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents. These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  It is Tharaldson Ethanol policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for the Tharaldson Ethanol facility based on the following:\n\n1.The facility is a stationary source of a flammable liquid.\n\n2.The facility has an amount of flammable material exceeding the allowable threshold limits for the individual components as provided in 40 CFR 68, Section 130.  According to the MSDS, 150,000 gallons of denaturant contains the following quantities of regulated substances above their respective thresholds of 10,000 pounds:\n? NFPA 4 Flammable Mixture; Denaturant ? 1,005,000 pounds \n(per 40 CFR 68.115 (b)(2), a mixture containing greater than 1% by weight of a substance with an NFPA rating of 4 for flammability must consider the entire weight of the mixture for threshold determination unless it can be shown that the mixture does not have an NFPA flammability rating of 4. The following are individual regulated components of the denaturant)  \n  Butane ? 60,300 pounds\n  Pentane ? 402"

      "FacilityID": 53272,
      "SummaryText": ",000 pounds\n  Iso-pentane ? 180,900 pounds\n\n3.The facility is involved in a process as defined in Section 1.4 of the General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR 68).  This section defines process as ?any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.?  It also defines ?vessel? as ?any reactor, tank, drum, barrel, cylinder, vat, kettle, boiler, pipe, hose, or other container.?\n\nAdditionally, Tharaldson Ethanol is subject to Program 3 requirements as determined by Section 2.1 of the General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR 68).  This program level is required because public receptors are located within the distance to endpoint for the flammable worst-case scenario and also because the process is subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  For reference, the distance to endpoint for the flammable worst-case scenario has been calculated to be 0.71 miles using Equation C-2 of Appendix C, Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The distance to the endpoint for the flammable alternative release scenario is 0.27 miles.\n\nThe flammables worst-case scenario involves the release of 1,005, 000 gallons of denaturant from the tank farm into the secondary containment area followed by the formation of a vapor cloud and a subsequent explosion.  The worst-case scenario was developed using the US EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (April 1999).  Public receptors are located within the 0.71 mile radius to overpressure as ca"

      "SummaryText": "lculated.  The receptors as determined by LandView and aerial photo inspection indicate a population of 11 people that reside within the radius.  Other public receptors within this radius include businesses (farm units). \n\nAdditionally, the flammable alternative release scenario is assumed to involve the release of denaturant from a tanker truck during transfer operations.  For this case, it is assumed that the entire contents of the truck would be released onto the transfer area containment pad and pool on the pad prior to vapor cloud formation and subsequent explosion.  Based on the denaturant MSDS and EPA guidance, this scenario also uses the entire weight of the mixture in determining the distance for offsite consequence analysis.  The 0.27 mile radius alternative release scenario does not include any population, residences, or other public or environmental receptors\n\nTharaldson Ethanol has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response including a Health & Safety Program, OSHA PSM, and Emergency Action Plan (EAP). A Facility Response Plan/Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (FRP/SPCC) Plan has been prepared and implemented in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.  These plans are available onsite in the plant manager?s office.\n\nThe facility will conduct employee training as part of the facility activities. The importance of worker, public, and environmental safety is reflected in Tharaldson Ethanol plans and training activities.  This RMP will be maintained onsite.  The RMP will be made available to the EPA upon request."
