If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Duchesne County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Upon discovery, all spills and releases of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, produced water, drilling fluids, methanol, well treatment chemicals, or associated wastes must be immediately reported to the Gas Services Foreman or Lead.  The Gas Services Foreman is accountable for all decisions and is the authority in emergency situations.  This person will also make proper notifications; however, the primary responsibility is the safety of the personnel on site.  The Gas Services Foreman will be responsible for contacting the Gas/Maintenance Superintendent.  The Gas/Maintenance Superintendent will contact the District Manager and the Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Manager.  The HSE Manager will contact applicable federal and state agencies, the corporate Newfield Office in Houston, and additional HSE personnel if necessary.  The HSE Manager is responsible for mobilizing appropriate spill response, containment, manpower, and equipment in accordance with the Oil Spill Contingency Plan.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe Ranch Compressor Station facility wholesales LPG, supplying retail outlets, primarily gas stations and cylinder filling operations at cooperatives.  The facility consists of a single 18,000-gallon tank, which we fill to between 85% and 88% capacity. The physical layout consists of separation and dehydration equipment, condensate storage areas, and compressor buildings used for treatment and compression of gas for sale.  Tanks and storage containers located on site (including oil/water separators) may contain natural gas, crude oi"

There are 12 Newfield personnel that staff the facility. The personnel may be on site two to three hours per day, seven days a week.  Third-party contractors also have access to the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the 18,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Since this facility is located in a remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  In the event of a leak or overflow, all valves associated with that portion of the system will be closed and the system shut down to prevent additional releases while response procedures are initiated.  When a spill occurs outside of the containment, or in the event of a large or catastrophic release, personnel must take the necessary precautions to contain the spill to the site.  Immediate notification to designated Newfield personnel is mandated and is the key to effective spill and release containment and control.  Such notification also allows the company to promptly report a spill event to appropriate government agencies, in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident at this facility that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe Gas Services Foreman is accountable for all decisions and is the authority in emergency situations.
