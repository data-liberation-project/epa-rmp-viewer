(CHESI) operates a hazardous waste treatment and storage facility (TSDF) in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste license issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Protection. CHESI strives to conduct its business and operations in strict conformity with all applicable laws, and in a safe and responsible manner. CHESI has always placed the highest priority on the health and safety of its employees and members of the community in which it operates.\r\n\r\nCHESI may be subject to the provisions of the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements because several of the regulated toxic and flammable liquids may be present in quantities which exceed the regulatory thresholds for these substances. Accordingly, CHESI has prepared a Risk Management Plan under the U.S. EPA's predictive filing provisions. CHESI will not exceed the threshold quantities for toxic gases and flammable gases.\r\n\r\nCHESI's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The CHESI facility is designed, constructed, inspected, maintained, and operated in a manner so as to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the public to hazardous materials managed at the site, and in conformity with all governmental regulations.\r\n\r\nCHESI has a comprehensive inspection plan which requires daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections of its processes, equipment, and management practices.\r\n\r\nCHESI has a Contingency Plan which prescribes procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or release at the facility.

An emergency response plan has been developed which prescribes emergency procedures which the facility will implement in the event of a release or fire at the facility.\r\n\r\nCHESI's emergency response plan is identified as the facility Contingency Plan. The purpose of this plan is to describe both the hazards associated with the management of waste materials at the facility and the steps which will be taken to minimize the risk associated with each hazard. By ensuring that proper preventative measures are taken at all times and by providing for emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of any unexpected occurrence(s), CHESI intends to operate its facility in a manner that does not pose a significant threat to public health, safety, or welfare of the environment. CHESI's record in this regard has been exceptional and its overall contribution to the protection of human health and the environment far surpasses the risks associated with the type of activities performed at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe specific elements of CHESI's Contingency Plan include the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA general description of the facility operations and the types of hazardous wastes handled at the facility.\r\n\u00bf\tA list of the CHESI emergency coordinators who are responsible for overseeing implementation of the Contingency Plan, and their responsibilities.\r\n\u00bf\tCriteria for implementing the Contingency Plan.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Procedures, including identification and assessment of an imminent or actual emergency, response procedures for facility personnel, and notification requirements.\r\n\u00bf\tA list of emergen"
