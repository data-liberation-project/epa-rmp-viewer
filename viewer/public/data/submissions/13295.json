The City entered into an agreement with Civil Design Associates, Inc. to assist them with preparing the required documents.\n\nThe City of Cambridge is developing accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the water pollution control center. These documents are on file at the City Engineer's office, Utility Director's office and the water pollution control center.  The City is committed to make this facility as safe as possible for the residents and employees.\n\nThe water pollution control center utilizes chlorine to purify the plant effluent prior to discharge.   The facility has the capacity to store four one ton cylinders of liquid chlorine or 8,000 pounds, although only one cylinder is active and one cylinder is connected for standby at any one time.\n\nAccident release scenarios were evaluated for this facility by use of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guideance.  Also, the Guernsey County EMA/LEPC prepared release scenarios in 1995 utilizing CAMEO modeling.  Although the worst case scenario assumes release of all 8,000 pounds of chlorine, this is highly unlikely due to the use, daily checking of equipment and alarm system setup.  A more likely worst case (alternate release scenario) is release of the contents of a one cylinder or 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The chlorination facilities are housed in a block building at the plant site and are completely isolated due the hazard involved.  If a release occurred it could have offsite impact.  The Guernsey County EMA/LEPC performed their release scenario to evaluate and prepare the emergency response procedure needed and be aware of the impacted area.\n\nThe City is always reviewing the prevention programs and procedures in place to make them better in the best interest of the employees and residents.  We have recently reviewed the procedures relative "
