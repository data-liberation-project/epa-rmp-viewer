      "SummaryText": "A Process Safety Plan and plant procedures have been developed and implemented to assure safe and consistent handling. Ammonia detectors and surveillance camera have been installed to detect any unusual conditions and a fogging system has been installed to mediate any potential ammonia release.   Only properly trained employees perform work on the system.  An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and backup support has been contracted to respond in case of an accidental release.  As required by EPA regulations, this Risk Management Plan contains Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios for the release of ammonia.  EPA's April 1999 Guidance for Offsite Release Analysis states that since worst case scenario distances are based on modeling conditions that are unlikely to occur, and since modeling of any scenario that results in large distances is very uncertain, EPA strongly urges communities and industry not to rely on the results of worst case modeling or any modeling that results in very large toxic endpoint distances in emergency planning and response.  Results of alternative scenario models are apt to provide a more reasonable basis for planning and response.  The alternative scenario models for Plant Hammond show that an accidental release of ammonia will not leave the plant site and will not effect any public receptors."
