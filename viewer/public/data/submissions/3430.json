              "Description": "Even though these three chemicals are stored in different co-located tanks, they will be considered under the same prevention program, since their physical properties and safeguards are essentially the same.  Trimethylamine (TMA) and Methyl chloride (MeCl) are both liquefied compressed gasses stored in 30,000-gallon tanks, each with its own containment.  The maximum storage is 130,000 pounds and 150,000 pounds, respectively.  There are written operating procedures with high-level alarms that prevent more than the mentioned maximum quantities in these tanks.  The ethyl chloride (EtCl) is also a liquefied compressed gas that is in an 8,000-gallon tank, with a maximum storage quantity of 52,000 pounds.  Each storage tank has two pressure relief valves (PRV), each valve having a rupture disk.  The PRV's are designed to relieve excess pressure below the designed pressure rating of the tanks; therefore, preventing a catastrophic failure of the tanks.  Annually, the PRV's are sent to a factory representative for testing and certification.  On each of the tanks, one of the PRV's is sent off at a time for testing then installed and the other set of PRV's is sent off.  Each PRV has a rupture disk installed to protect the PRV from chemical attack and to eliminate any leakage through the PRV.  Each of the storage tanks and associated piping has annual integrity checks, which includes tank thickness testing.  Daily leak checks of tanks and piping as well as daily inventory checks ensure that all the material is accounted for.  The TMA, MeCl, and EtCl are purchased from approved suppliers and use dedicated drivers and trailers for their transportation.  Only qualified SACHEM operating associates unload the chemicals to the storage tanks and to process vessels.  All SACHEM associates operate under the philosophy that safety, health and environmental stewardship is a precondition to anything that we do.  They work hard every single day to be a safe, environmentally friendly neighbor.",

              "Description": "The bulk storage of formaldehyde is anticipated in the near future at SACHEM.  Currently, a developmental process uses formaldehyde in 330-gallon containers.  When this process becomes full-scale, 37% formaldehyde, with 11% methanol as a stabilizer, will be stored in a 6500-gallon stainless steel tank.  This storage tank will be in an outside containment area and daily leak checks will be performed on the tank and associated piping.  Also, a daily inventory will be taken to ensure that all material is accounted for.  Prior to unloading formaldehyde into the storage tank, a process hazardous review will be done to verify all safeguards are in place.  Extensive operator training and operating procedures will be activated.  The storage tank will be vented to a scrubber system to prevent any vapors from escaping due to breathing losses.  When the tank truck is off loaded into the storage tank, it will be a closed loop system; whereby the vapors from the storage tank will be put back into the tank truck.  The transfer pump on the storage tank will be seal-less, for vapor-free operation.  Periodic mechanical integrity on the storage tank and associated piping will be done, including tank thickness checks.  Only qualified SACHEM operating associates unload the chemical to the storage tank and to the process vessel.  All SACHEM associates operate under the philosophy that safety, health and environmental stewardship is a precondition to anything that we do.  We work hard every single day to be a safe, environmentally friendly neighbor.",

      "SummaryText": "SACHEM, Inc. is a specialty chemical manufacturer located in Cleburne's Industrial Park.  We provide high purity chemicals and services worldwide to electronics, catalysts, and pharmaceutical markets and to most major chemical manufacturers.  The company was started in Austin in 1950, expanded to the current bulk production facility at Cleburne in 1990 and most recently, has opened a facility in Osaka, Japan.  SACHEM's Mission Statement and Environmental Policy speaks to Safety, Health and Environmental stewardship being a precondition to anything that we do.  All associates operate under that philosophy.  We work hard every single day to be a safe, environmentally friendly neighbor and we are involved in many voluntary programs at the local, state and federal level.  We are proactive in various civic activities in Cleburne and are active members of the Johnson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The President of SACHEM has said many times,  \"There is not one pound of chemical worth making that jeopardizes safety, health, and the environment.\" \n\nSACHEM, Inc. is an ISO 9000 certified facility and is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its production processes.  We are members of SOCMA, Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturer's Association, which is equivalent to the Chemical Manufacturer's Association.  As a member of SOCMA, SACHEM is required to implement the Responsible Careb Codes of Management Practices and Guiding Principles.  Some of the key Guiding Principles are: 1.  To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations, 2. To make health, safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new products and processes and 3. To operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public.\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) is also part of SACHEM's daily operating philosophy.

The hazards of the chemicals are found in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), which SACHEM retains, for each chemical it has on site.  Operator training is a major undertaking at SACHEM.  Before a new operator is allowed to operate a process, he goes through extensive training using the SOCMA Training Manual.\n\nThere are operating associates on-site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ensuring that the plant is operating in a safe manner.  Daily leak checks and inspections are performed on all process piping, reaction vessels and storage tanks.  All process equipment and storage vessels have safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutoff devices and relief valves and continuous computer monitoring to prevent problems.  There are yearly integrity inspections on vessels, piping and electrical equipment which includes storage vessel thickness inspections.  The pressure relief valves from storage vessels and process equipment are sent to a factory representative for yearly inspection and testing.  SACHEM has received OSHA's SHARP Recognition for the 4th year, which exempts OSHA inspectors from doing programmed inspections.\n\nAs previously mentioned, SACHEM manufactures specialty chemicals.  The chemicals that are on site above threshold quantities are methyl chloride, trimethylamine, ethyl chloride and formaldehyde.  The maximum storage quantities of each are 150,000 pounds, 130,000 pounds, 52,000 pounds, and 52,000 pounds, respectively.  Methyl chloride and formaldehyde are on the toxic list, while trimethylamine and ethyl chloride are on the flammable list.

      "SummaryText": " the OCA Guidance Document.  Written operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent more than 150,000 pounds and 130,000 pounds, for methyl chloride and trimethylamine respectively, from being present in the 30,000-gallon tanks.  Currently, 2 - 3 tank truckloads of each of these are unloaded weekly.  There was some consideration to reduce the storage of methyl chloride and trimethylamine even more, but that would mean daily shipments and the increased transportation hazard would start becoming a cause for concern.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario (ARS), the storage tank was assumed to overpressure causing the pressure relief valve to vent the excess pressure.  The ARS for trimethylamine and methyl chloride impacted off-site receptors using the OCA Guidance Document, while the ethyl chloride and formaldehyde did not reach off-site.  Trimethylamine and methyl chloride are liquefied compressed gasses and kept under pressure for storage at ambient temperature.  The pressure relief valves are installed to prevent the worst case scenario.  They are designed to relieve the pressure prior to tank failure.  Other systems in place to manage the risk include daily visual inspection of the storage tanks, daily raw material inventory, contractor safety training, preventive maintenance program, and incident investigations on all near misses.\n\nThe five-year accident history shows that there have been no RMP reportable accidents in the 9 years SACHEM has been in Cleburne.  This means there has been no on-site deaths, injuries, or property damage and no off-site deaths, hospitalizations, medical treatment, evacuation, sheltering-in-place, property damage and environmental damage, which includes fish or animal kills, tree, lawn, shrub, or crop damage, water contamination, or soil contamination.\n\nAs mentioned previously, there have been no RMP reportable accidents in the 9 years SACHEM has been in Cleburne.

      "SummaryText": "ethyl chloride or ethyl chloride, the first two releases in sufficient amounts to cause odors in the immediate area and were reported to the proper state, local, and federal agencies.  Those incidents are:\n\n1. On June 24, 1995, 1039 pounds of methyl chloride and 82 pounds of trimethylamine were released from a reaction vessel because of a malfunction of a rupture disk.  A piece of the rupture disk lodged in the seat of the pressure relief valve (PRV) causing the PRV to not completely close after venting the excess pressure.  Two problems occurred with the rupture disk.  The rupture disk blew below the stated tolerance and also the rupture disk fragmented.  As a result of this incident, a new supplier for rupture disks has been found.\n\n2. On June 22, 1998, approximately 438 pounds of trimethylamine was released from a vessel that vented excess pressure through a pressure relief valve.  A control valve leaked through causing the vessel to be filled beyond its limits.  Also, operator error occurred preventing proper action to be taken after the fact.  Since then, more in depth training on the equipment has occurred, the control valve has been adjusted for minimal leak through when closed, and a redundant high alarm has been programmed.\n\n3. On April 23, 1998, approximately 15 pounds of ethyl chloride was released from a stainless steel hose from an ethyl chloride cylinder.  The transfer hose failed causing the release.  Since this incident, we are storing ethyl chloride in bulk and all piping is permanent.\n\nSACHEM's Emergency Response Program was developed with input from the Cleburne Fire Department, local LEPC, and Cleburne Emergency Management officials.  If an emergency occurs, a plant wide alarm is sounded with instructions given over the intercom system.  The emergency phone number, 911, is called to inform the City of Cleburne of our needs and the type of emergency present.  If an evacuation is necessary, all associates, including contractors, are gathered and ro"

In using this system, all the emergency groups are talking and understanding the same language. The emergency is assessed and additional response equipment and associates are called, if required.  SACHEM has 10 associates that are HAZWOPER, Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response, trained that are available to attend to most spills.  We have a 24-hour emergency responder contracted to help us in an emergency, if needed.  The Cleburne Police Department will assist SACHEM if evacuation or sheltering in place is required.  We test the emergency alarm system weekly and have quarterly drills. At least annually, we have a joint drill with Cleburne Emergency Departments and our 24-hour emergency responder to ensure that SACHEM's Emergency Response Program is kept up to date.  The HAZWOPER trained associates also go through annual refresher training.\n\nSACHEM believes strongly about its continuous improvement of all processes and equipment.  Before a new process is added, a Process Hazardous Review and Pre-Start Up Review are completed to ensure that all aspects of safety, health and the environment are considered.
