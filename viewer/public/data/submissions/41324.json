Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program or federal RMP requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reduc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                notification of the local emergency responders.

The facility lies approximately 1.4 miles east of Interstate Highway 5 in an area comprised primarily of agricultural and industrial facilities.  The small town of French Camp is located about 1 mile southwest of the facility.  The Stockton Metropolitan Airport lies approximately \u00bd mile east of the plant.  State Highway 99 runs east-west and the closest point to the plant is about 2.5 miles to the east.  The facility also lies very close to the Union Pacific railroad tracks.\n\nCoastal Pacific (CPF) was founded in 1986 as a military distributor in support of the overseas bases located in Japan, Korea, Okinawa, and Guam.  In less than a decade, CPF became the premier military distributor for the entire West Coast and the Far East.  With full-service distribution centers in Stockton, California; Ontario, California; and Fife, Washington, Coastal Pacific is positioned to provide expedient service to all bases.  CPF provides state-of-the-art information systems designed for timely sales and shipping information with a sole focus on the military resale industry.\n\nThis facility stores and distributes various food and non-food related supplies under approximately 500,000 square feet of warehouse space, a portion of which is refrigerated.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Coastal Pacific Food Distributors facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a"

The PHA team developed a list of recommendations to improve safety by reducing potential hazards of the process.  All recommendations were implemented, deemed unnecessary since no improvements to safety would result, or planned for implementation at a later date.  Upcoming events include:\n\n?
