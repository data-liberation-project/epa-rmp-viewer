      "SummaryText": "Airgas Specialty Gases manufactures, stores and distributes industrial compressed gases. \r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to incorporate additional storage and distribution of n-Butane packaged in cylinders. \r\nThe flammable characteristics make it necessary to observe certain precautions when storing and handling n-Butane.\r\nIt is the policy of Airgas Specialty Gases to adhere to all applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations. \r\nOverall safety of the facility depends upon the manner in which products are maintained as well as the training of associates involved in the process. \r\nWritten policies and procedures for handling these products are followed each day. \r\nThe facility adheres to the Airgas Safety Management System which includes items such as Lockout/Tag out, Hazard Communication, Contractor Safety, etc. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place to aid in the prevention of accidental releases and natural disasters that may affect the facility.\r\nIf a release were to occur at this location associates would be notified of the release by activation of an audible & visual alarm, gather at the evacuation point for a head count and notify the Tooele Fire Department, if necessary. The Tooele Fire Department is the primary response agency to a release\r\nat this location and is trained in Hazardous Materials operations.\r\nThis facility has a flammable worst case scenario. The worst case scenario would be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the full release and ignition of a cylinder containing 116 lbs. of n-Butane.\r\nThe distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 0.04 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered rural, thus this release scenario would not likely impact any persons in a 0.04 mile radius.\r\nThis information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software.\r\nThere have been no accidental releases from this facility in the past five years."
