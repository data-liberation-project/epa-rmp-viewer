Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\nZirkle Fruit Company (ZFC) accidental release prevention policy integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. ZFC adhere's to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\nZFC personnel do not respond to ammonia releases. The emergency plan requires employees to call 9-1-1 and evacuate the plant in the event of an ammonia release.\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a closed refrigeration system at ZFC. Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our personnel and reduce the treat to the community.\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\nZirkle Fruit Co. is an apple packing facility. At this site there are cold room as well as controled atmosphere rooms. It is located at 352 Harrison rd. in Selah Washington.\nThe regulated substance used at Zirkle Fruit co. is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant. There is 65,000 pounds of ammonia in the entire system.\n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nZirkle Fruit Company's accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n*Training of personnel\n*Preventative maintenance program\n*Use of safety equipment\n*Use of accurate and effective standard operating procedures\n\nZirkle Fruit Company complies with the following regulations:\n*OSHA and WISHA process safety management rule\n*SARA Title 3 Tire two reporting of Extreamly Hazardous subtances\n*EPA CFR 40 part 68\n*EPA Risk management Plan 112r under the clean air act\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to meet or exceed all standards and local codes.Piping and equipment is secured and protected. Other safety system utilized at ZFC include the following:\n*Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n*Suction trap Hi-level float\n*High discharge pressure shut down\n"

Procedures are kept in the engine room and in the safety managers office. These procedures include:\n*Pre-start up procedures\n*Routine operations\n*Preventative maintenance\n*Response to major and minor releases\n*Emergency action plan\n\nE. Five-Year Accident History\nWe have had no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\nEmployees at ZFC do not respond to emergencies involving the release of ammonia. Our response is to evacuate or shelter in place and call 9-1-1 for assistance. The refrigeration personnel will assist the fire department on technical aspects of the operation.\n\nG. Planned Safety Improvements\nZFC will continue to conduct preventative mantenance on all equipment to ensure mechanical integrity. Employee training will be updated at least annually."
