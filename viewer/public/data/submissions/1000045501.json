Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nZacky Farms, LLC is strongly committed to the safety of our employees, the public and the\n\nenvironment. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention\n\nprogram that addresses the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee\n\ntraining associated with the covered processes at our facility.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n\nsubstances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\n\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Region 5 LEPC\n\nInland South and the Fresno Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response\n\nexpertise. \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nZacky's primary activity in Fresno is poultry processing. At our East Turkey Plant facility,\n\nlocated at 2222 S. East Ave. in Fresno, CA, we process and package poultry products. Ammonia\n\nis our only RMP regulated substance and is used to provide refrigeration for the cold storage of\n\nour poultry products. The maximum inventory of ammonia at this facility is 9,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention\n\nSteps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The ammonia refrigeration system is also\n\nsubject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and to EPCRA Section 302\n\nnotification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release\n\nprevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nZacky Farms maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\n\nhazards, operating parameters and equi"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the\n\nWhat If/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in\n\nengineering and process operations and are validated at a regular interval of at least five years.\n\nAny findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Zacky Farms has\n\ndeveloped written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation\n\nsuch as initial startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and startup, and normal shutdown\n\nand startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved\n\nin the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nZacky Farms has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\n\noperating covered processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\n\nprocesses. Refresher training is provided at least every three years or more frequently as needed.\n\nAll training is documented and validated.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nZacky Farms carries out documented maintenance checks on all covered process equipment to\n\nensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels,\n\nstorage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls\n\nand pumps, compressors, and condensers and evaporators. Maintenance is carried out by\n\nqualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Maintenance personnel are\n\noffered specialized training as needed.

These procedures are in place\n\nto ensure that all changes to the covered process are documented and reviewed for associated\n\nsafety and operational issues.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes are\n\nconducted as a regular practice at Zacky Farms. These reviews are conducted to confirm that\n\nconstruction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\n\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nZacky Farms will conduct audits on a regular basis to verify that the provisions set out under the\n\nRMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every three years and\n\nany corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt\n\nmanner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nZacky Farms promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could have resulted in a\n\ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including\n\nadequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response\n\nagencies and the public, as well as post incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and\n\nserviced.
