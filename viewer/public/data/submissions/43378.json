As part of this commitment, FFD/HC has established a system to help ensure safe operations of the regulated processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at FFD/HC's Fernbridge Facility.  FFD/HC's RMP complies with the requirements of California Accidental Release Program (Cal ARP), OSHA PSM standards, and the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nFFD/HC's RMP consists of three elements:\n\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand the potential on- and off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and accidents that have occurred during the past five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP Rule.\n\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.\n\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substance from the covered process.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan), and FFD/HC's Ammonia Refrigeration System Procedures Manual.  FFD/HC's Fernbridge Facility, the ammonia processes, equipment, systems, and controls are designed, and constructed to current codes, which reduces the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the process equipment and their structures.  \n\nThe safety program at FFD/HC's Fernbridge Facility consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFFD/HC is committed t"

FFD/HC implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances, which include; training key employees to respond appropriately to an accidental release; coordination and training with the Eel River Valley Fire Authority and Eureka Hazardous Materials Response Team (HMRT); coordination with the Humboldt County Division of Environmental Health (HCDEH) to provide CUPA RMP review and facility inspections; establishing in-house inspection and evaluation programs to identify potential hazards; implementing a testing program on critical equipment and piping systems; and coordination with other facilities that have similar ammonia processes, to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damages will be minimal if a release does occur. \n\nFFD/HC continually monitors the operating set point parameters of its critical equipment using a computer system that can be accessed on-site as well as remotely.  In the event of an accidental release, FFD/HC and the Eel River Valley Fire Authority will assess the situation, and if required they will call other first responders.  FFD/HC and the trained first responders will respond to the release in a manner that will be safe for the responders, the on-site workers, the public, and the environment.  FFD/HC has designated an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and that person will continue to coordinate FFD/HC's response efforts with the first responders, HCDEH, and the local community.  Required changes to emergency contact information will be reported within one (1) month.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, FFD/HC established a management system headed by the Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.  \n\n1.2  FFD/HC's Regulated Substances Handled and Source Information\n\nAs part of this Facility's cooling and refrigeration systems, anhydrous ammonia is stored and utiliz"

The federal threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, and this facility contains approximately 33,000 pounds.\n\n1.3  Off-site Consequence Analysis (See Section 4, and Appendix A)\n\nFFD/HC performed an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, which is a regulated substance that could adversely affect the public or the environment.  FFD/HC's OCA consisted of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  \n\nA worst-case release scenario is unlikely to occur; however, FFD/HC's alternative release scenarios represent a release that might occur at a facility like FFD/HC's.  The main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). \n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substances released could be impacted.\n\n1.3.1  Worst Case Release Scenarios for the Program 3 Process (See Appendix A)\n\n1.3.2  Alternative Anhydrous Ammonia Release Scenarios (See Appendix A)\n\n1.4  Mitigation Measures\n\nThe Fernbridge Facility has on-site mitigation measures, which include; a visible wind sock; ammonia sensors within the process and storage areas; sensors connected into alarms and warning light systems; operators present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; a computer system that monitors critical ammonia process equipment, and can be accessed on-site and at remote locations; a newer facility in which much of the ammonia tanks and systems are located inside; venting systems for pressur"

Additionally, FFD/HC has an emergency generator with a 10 second automatic switch over system in case of power outages.\n\nOff-site mitigation measures include; a visible a wind sock; portable hand held ammonia sensor for emergency response situations, and maintenance monitoring; and coordination with the Eel River Valley Fire Authority, Eureka HMRT, and two other local fire departments, so they can respond to emergencies at FFD/HC's Fernbridge Facility in a safe and efficient manner. \n\nAdditionally, the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Compliance Audits (CA), and inspections of this facility and its processes equipment assists in making the regulated systems and response efforts safer.  \n\n1.5  Accidental Release Program and Emergency Planning (See Appendix B)\n\nIn September 2006, FFD/HC reviewed and revised the Emergency Response Plan.  Additionally, Section 7.0 of this report includes a specific Emergency Response Program for ammonia.  FFD/HC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the facility ammonia processes.  These documents address the physical properties of the hazardous substances handled, operating parameters of the systems, and equipment operating procedures for these processes.
