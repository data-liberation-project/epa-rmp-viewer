We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, one 12,000-gallon tank, forty-seven 1,000-gallon nurse\r\ntanks, and nine 1,500-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Goshen, Indiana (Figure 1).  The maximum\r\namount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 87,125 gallons (448,345.3 pounds)\r\nincluding the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility\r\ncontains 131,223 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nHelena Chemi"
