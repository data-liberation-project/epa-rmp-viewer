A key element of the plant's protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, plant personnel are prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.  \n\n\n\nThe plant's accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from local emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nThe plant's Risk Management Program (RMP) plan was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP plan describes the incidents that would have the most catastrophic effects (the \"worst-case release scenarios\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative release scenarios\"). Although it is technically infeasible for the worst-case release scenarios described in this plan to occur, the information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to incidents of lesser magnitude, which are more likely to occur.\n\n\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using RMP*Comp (Ver 1.07), which was developed by U. S. EPA for accidental chemical release modeling.\n\n\n\nEMERY OLEOCHEMICALS LLC\n\n\n\nCognis Corporation carved out the Fatty Acid, Glycerine, Ozone Acids and Plastics Technology Businesses creating Cognis Oleochemicals LLC in January 2006.  In May 2009, the company name was changed to "

Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs, and considerable time and resources have been invested in this effort.  \n\n\n\nThe plant has detailed procedures to ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of each process.  Plant personnel receive regular safety training, and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety performance improvement.  Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\n\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate or shelter employees as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to control the release and minimize its consequences.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE \n\n\n\nThe Emery Oleochemicals LLC Cincinnati, Ohio plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 4900 Este Avenue.  A variety of processes are operated at the plant to produce products derived from animal fat or vegetable oil.  The plant, originally constructed in 1885, is situated on 40 acres of land. Part of the plant is located in the City of Cincinnati and part is located in the City of St. Bernard.  The two parts are separated by the Mill Creek, a tributary of the Ohio River.  Fatty Acids, Glycerine and Ozone Acids are the major products produced at the Cincinnati plant. In 2015 Emery Oleochemicals added batch reactors for the manufacture of fatty acid based esters and polyols.  Neither of the new processes are regulated under the RMP standards.\n\n\n\nThe plant is "

EPA guidance, an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA included both worst-case release scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Considering the design of the regulated processes and the plant's accident prevention programs, it is virtually impossible for the WCSs to occur.  Although it is highly unlikely that the ARSs would ever occur, the ARSs represent release scenarios that are at least somewhat feasible. \n\n\n\nThe main objective of the OCA was to determine the furthest distance (called the endpoint distance) at which certain conditions might exist as a result of an accidental chemical release.  Most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences are possible.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Cincinnati plant has an good accident prevention record.  The RMP regulations require companies to report all significant releases from regulated processes that occurred during the past five years.  The site had a significant release on June 12, 2018 and a correction to the RMP was submitted.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Cincinnati plant.  Since processes at the plant that are regulated under the RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Cincinnati plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and ac"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include PHA and PSSR team involvement, safety suggestion program, and 5S housekeeping standards.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Cincinnati plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates the hazards associated with a process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigating options in response to a PHA is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities or for specialized maintenance work.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\n\nA? Perform their work in a safe manner, \n\nA? Have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n\nA? Are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n\nA? Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n\nA? Understand and follow site safety rules, and \n\nA? Inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with the necessary training prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\n\n\nThe plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or major modification of an existing facility. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.
