The facility is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule for one flammable substances, hydrogen. The hydrogen is used in various furnaces to provide an inert atmosphere during heating of tungsten and molybdenum.  The facility also stores propane in volumes that exceed the threshold quantity, but is exempt from part 68 of Title 40 of the CFR because it is stored for use as a fuel.  Since the hydrogen and propane are contained in the same process as determined by OSHA, both the hydrogen and propane equipment at the facility are subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The facility does not have any toxic substances covered by OSHA's PSM standard or EPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\nLiquid hydrogen is stored behind the facility in two above-ground storage tanks, each having a capacity of 10,150 pounds of liquid hydrogen.  A vaporizing system located next to the storage tanks converts the liquid hydrogen to a gas before it is distributed throughout the building for use in furnaces. Elmet leases the outdoor hydrogen storage and delivery equipment from Praxair, Inc. of Danbury, Connecticut. Praxair is responsible for operation and maintenance of the outdoor hydrogen equipment, and provides the hydrogen supply through regular delivery by tank truck. Praxair implements its own safety procedures for Elmet's hydrogen system, including periodic equipment inspections and driver training.  Elmet has discharge detection devices and emergency warning systems within the facility such that the central alarm would sound in the event of a hydrogen release.  These systems are inspected annually.\n\n  \n\nThere have been no serious accidents involving hydrogen in the last five years of operation at the site.  As part of Elmet's emergency response plan, the facility has developed procedures for notifying the public and providing instructions on what to do in the"
