The source material gas which is transfilled and sometimes purified may be packaged in ton cylinder units (i.e. tonners) or regular cylinders, depending on the gas.  The finished product varies from a single pure chemical gas to gas mixtures.  The finished product cylinders vary from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas depending on the size of the cylinder and the type of material involved.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the procedures necessary to prevent accidental releases of chemicals.  In addition we are committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the emergency response procedures necessary to mitigate a release quickly and effectively if it does occur.  \n\nRegulated Chemicals and Processes\n\nThere are 4 chemicals at the Matheson Tri-Gas Newark facility that are regulated under the Federal RMP Program. The detailed applicability of all inventory levels is listed in the on-site California RMP (Cal-ARP) documentation. The 4 processes regulated by Federal RMP regulations can be summarized as follows:\n  \nChemical    Process\nAmmonia    Storage\nChlorine    Purification/Storage\nHydrogen Chloride    Storage\nHydrogen Fluoride    Storage\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Mitigation Measures\n\nThe major elements of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and release mitigation measures at this site are as follows:  \n\nLife safety system.  A state-of-the-art life safety system was installed in late 1999 and early 2000.  This system monitors the presence of various toxic and flammable gases in areas where those gases are stored or processed.  Two-stage alarms are set for each sensor.  The low-level alarm alerts the facility that a problem may be developing.  The high-le"

The system provides real time readouts of gas concentrations and records information that assists in both preventing and mitigating gas releases as well as information that can assist in improving the process.  \n\nAdherence to objective equipment standards.  One of the most significant contributors to the prevention of accidental releases at this site is the high standards to which all gas cylinders must be manufactured.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) has detailed requirements for manufacturing and testing cylinders. Cylinders must be manufactured according to a particular metallurgical standard and be able to withstand overfilling; an increase in pressure; an increase in temperature and the possibility that they will be hit or fall over.     \n\nPiping and other equipment such as tanks associated with gas processes adheres to ASTM standards.  Toxic gas processing is done in exhausted enclosures that meet ventilation standards.  All residual gas is vented to scrubbers that are constructed to meet both air emission and fire code standards.  \n\nProcess hazard analysis.  Process hazard analyses are performed on relevant processes to determine potential hazards and recommendations for process improvements. \n\nDevelopment and implementation of standard operating procedures.  \nA comprehensive training program that includes classroom and on-the-job training. \nA systematic preventive maintenance program.  All relevant equipment is on a schedule for inspection; inspections are documented and certain equipment is replaced on a regular schedule. \nA thorough accident reporting and investigation program.  The accident/incident reporting and investigation procedure requires the reporting and investigation not only of incidents resulting in injuries, but also incidents that had the potential to result in an injury to an employee or a significant impact on the company's business. \n\nRestricted ac"

Motion detectors and facility cameras are available for recording activity through the plant.\nFive-Year Accident History. There has been no accidental release from a Federal RMP regulated process in the last five years at this facility.  This would include the years from Jan. 1999 to the present.\nEmergency Response Program.\nA brief description of the elements of this facility's Emergency Response Program are as follows:  \nIdentification and location of hazardous materials.  All hazardous material have been identified, located and mapped.  A cylinder storage procedure maintains consistent locations for each material.  \nA trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) of 30 members.  ERT members have hazardous technician level of training (24+ hours) and must go through refresher training every year.  At least four responders are always available during after-work hours.  Appropriate personal protective equipment is maintained at the site for response actions.  \nEvacuation procedure.  Evacuation routes and procedures have been developed and all personnel trained on them.  \nEmergency response contact list.  This list is maintained and all personnel are trained on the portions relevant to their job.\nEmergency response procedure.  This procedure details the sequence of activities for various emergency scenarios: gas or fire alarm; gas release, injury, fire, liquid spill. \nCoordination with local agencies.  The facility has made sure that the local fire department is familiar with all materials, processes and monitoring equipment. There are training visits for the fire department.  The life safety system automatically calls the fire department if there is a high-level alarm and response procedures are always coordinated with them.

The new Life Safety System has been briefly described above.  New canopies were built in the receiving area and the main storage area so that toxic gases could be monitored and releases reported directly to the Fire Department.  In 2001, all scrubbers were upgraded or replaced to assure that even if production increases, all Fire Code emergency release requirements will be met. In 2002, on-site security was improved to have an around-the-clock presence at the Facility."
