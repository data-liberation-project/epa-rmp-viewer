      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP has been operating the Encino Chlorination Station (ECS) since 1956. The ECS is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  The LADWP made significant improvements to the chlorination facility to further enhance the safety of the chlorine handling process. The modified chlorination facility is in operation since 2006. The Encino Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan, and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). An update is required at least once every five years from the date of its initial submission.  An update is also required within six months of a change that alters the Program Level that applied to any covered process. The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\n \n\nA Risk Management Plan for the Encino Chlorination Station was prepared in June 1999 that was updated in June 2004.

An update to the April 2006 Risk Management Plan, reflecting these minor changes was prepared in December 2006.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs from 1999 through 2006 because Encino Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP prepared a Program Level 3 RMP in 2010 for the ECS and submitted it to the LAFD. In April 2014, the LADWP performed a PHA for the ECS, including the ventilation system provided for the chlorination system. The LADWP, therefore, decided to update the ECS RMP prepared and submitted in 2010.

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Encino Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). The Encino Chlorination Station has a good record in preventing accidents from occurring. \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Encino Chlorination Station is located at 4500 Encino Avenue, Encino, California.  The station serves to disinfect drinking water by chlorinating water in the reservoir and at various locations in the on-site water piping system.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of the San Fernando Valley with potable water.  The station consists of a three building complex: the pump station, the chlorination station and the membrane filtration plant. The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. Chlorine containers can be attached to the liquid chlorine header for discharging chlorine, as well as to the gas header which provides an automatic backup supply. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Encino Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.

On-line containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in each container. All on-line containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the container valves. The primary bank is connected to the chlorine liquid header and the secondary bank is connected to the chlorine gas header.  The liquid chlorine passes from the containers to the evaporator where it is vaporized in a water bath.  Gaseous chlorine from the secondary bank of containers bypasses the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry, or when the evaporators shut down due to (1) a low water level, (2) temperature condition, or (3) power loss.  Space is allocated in the room for the storage of additional one-ton containers without any connection to the chlorination system.\n\nThe gas header line is equipped with automatic switchover vacuum regulating valves (a combination of evaporator actuated vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit and standby vacuum regulating valve with check-relief vent), and pressure gauges.  The liquid header line is equipped with pressure gauges and an expansion chamber to protect against excessive pressure.  The primary (liquid) bank provides all the chlorine to the station through the evaporators until it is depleted.  The gaseous chlorine bank automatically starts supplying chlorine when the primary bank is depleted.  This automatic system is achieved by setting the automatic vacuum regulating valve leading from the secondary bank to standby.  Once the primary bank is depleted, the higher vacuum level acts on the diaphragm of the automatic switchover vacuum regulator in the secondary bank, thereby pulling that valve open to start feeding gas.\n\nThe gaseous chlorine from the evaporators or fr"

Chlorine gas from the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief units is pulled by vacuum to the chlorinators and then to the injectors located in an underground vault, cabinet, or within the membrane filtration building.  The injectors provide vacuum, which draws chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  It is important to note that in case of loss of vacuum downstream of the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released and the vacuum regulating valve with check-relief unit will shut down the chlorine supply to the chlorinator, operating as a shut-off valve. The concentrated water and chlorine solution is piped through diffusers into the reservoir and to various locations in the on-site water piping system. Process control is by a programmable controller, which determines the feed rate relative to the water flow rate.  There are flow meters transmitting flow signals to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\n\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.\n\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system (main scrubber) is installed at the station.

Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release.\n\n\n\n(b)    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance. \n\n(c)    Training in relevant procedures for all employees involved with the chlorination process.\n\n(d)    Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of reviewing and updating the October 2006 PHA for the Encino Chlorination Station, a PHA was performed in April 2011. Based on the 2011 PHA, a few equipment and procedural changes were recommended. All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the LADWP. Additionally, four recommendations to further improve chlorine safety were identified in March 2014, when the PHA was reviewed for the facility. Based on the 2014 seismic assessment, three additional recommendations were made to improve chlorine safety. It is expected that all the recommendations will be evaluated by December 2014 and implemented by June 2015. The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorine system.\n\n\n\n"
