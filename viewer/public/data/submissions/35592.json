      "SummaryText": "Amrex Chemical Company is a wholesale chemical distributor that warehouses and repackages a variety of hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals.  The E. Frederick Street facility is the main office and plant.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. The following hazardous chemicals subject to PSM are stored on site:  anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride.  The only chemical subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements is hydrofluoric acid (70%). Anhydrous ammonia and ammonia (conc 20% or greater) were reported in 1999; however inventories of these materials have been reduced below threshold quantities.\n\nThe facility's prevention program includes implementation of procedures to address employee safety and to reduce risk of accidents involving hazardous chemicals.  An area that has secondary containment and a neutralization tank is utilized to capture, contain and neutralize spills.  This program has been successful in that there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.  The facility also has a written emergency response plan that includes specific actions to be taken in the event of a spill.  Employees receive regular training in both the prevention program and the emergency response plan.  The facility seeks to improve safety by regular review of its safety policies and performance."
