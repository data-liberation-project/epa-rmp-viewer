      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Van Waters & Rogers Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass warehousing .  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] and Ammonia (aqueous). All substances are warehoused for the purpose of resale.                                          .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrochloric acid [Hydrogen chloride] at our facility is 24,245.00 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 27,743.00 lb.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s),             including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for             each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from warehousing.  In this scenario 190 lb. of Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The re"

      "SummaryText": "leased quantity has been limited to 38% of the maximum capacity of the source. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 56.1 lb.. The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by neutralization.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.06 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) involves a release from warehousing.  The scenario involves the release of 95 lb.. The toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of a 5% reduction.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by  neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 mg/L of Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific      Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What If scenario.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/16/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Van Waters & Rogers Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is conducted on an on going basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes all warehousing type equipment.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and"

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 05/25/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Van Waters & Rogers Inc.. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 03/16/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no RMP regulated substances released above the threshold quantities in the past 5 years at this facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Additional training for spill response and personal protection equipment are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are expected to be implemented by 12/99."
