      "SummaryText": "Boulder Scientific Company, LLC (BSC) is a small specialty chemical manufacturer. The Longmont facility has historically housed R&D labs and chemical storage but will commence production operations in the second quarter of 2020. Ethyl ether is a component of several products made by BSC at the Mead plant. These products are temporarily stored at the Longmont facility until sold or used in subsequent BSC processes. Chemical properties of the products warrant indoor storage.  This RMP is triggered by the aggregate amount of ethyl ether stored in the building. The products referenced above are contained in closed DOT cylinders with 120 gallon capacity. Cylinders are not opened for sampling or transfers. Aggregate quantities exceeding the RMP threshold may be stored in each of two cells on the west side of the building; storage amounts fluctuate below and above the threshold. Stored volumes are dependent on production and sales rates. \r\n\r\nFire suppression consists of 3% AR-AFFF foam in the storage and production areas of the building. Fire suppression in the remainder of the building is water.  The storage areas are also designed with secondary containment; the secondary containment volume is approximately 3,200 gallons.  The fire wall rating is 2 hours.\r\n\r\nModeling of the worst-case scenario indicates a radius of impact of 0.1 mile, which extends off of the property boundary. There is a single residence near the facility that is located approximately 0.1 mile to the northeast.  Although modeled as a wort-case scenario, EPA points out in their guidance document that the impact distance does not necessarily represent the likely result of an accident. The \"alternate scenario\" of a pool fire resulted in an impact distance of less than 0.06 miles, which extends slightly beyond the property boundary.\r\n\r\nPotential off-property impact to the northeast includes the single residence located approximately 0.1 from the storage area mentioned above. There are also oil and gas stora"

The BSC facility is located on the eastern-most portion of a light industrial area; there are industrial operations to the north and west. There are no buildings to the immediate south of BSC's property.  \r\n\r\nBSC has written and tested a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan that will be followed in the event of an emergency incident on the property. The Plan describes steps to be taken in the event of a major fire or chemical release. BSC maintains OSHA-certified responders on each production shift and coordinates practice responses with Mountain View Fire Department."
