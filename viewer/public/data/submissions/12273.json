The facility, or stationary source, is located on 39 Riverside Avenue, just ouside Albany, New York. Rensselaer Cogen employs approximately 15 full time individuals.\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy (' 68.155a)\n\nIt is the policy of management at Rensselaer Cogen to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of aqueous ammonia and, if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Rensselaer Cogen's employees, the public, and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, by providing appropriate training to all employees, and by coordinating response activities, as necessary with the local emergency response providers.\n\nRensselaer Cogen's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled (' 68.155b)\n\nRensselaer Cogen is comprised of a combustion turbine/generator, a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), a steam turbine/generator, a steam surface condense, a cooling tower, steam, water and wastewater systems, and fuel handling and storage systems. The plant operates two shifts, seven days per week.\n\nThe facility uses aqueous ammonia in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. The aqueous ammonia system consists of one (1) 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nLocal and remote level gauges are used to monitor tank level during filling and to prevent overfill.

An ambient atmosphere ammonia gas monitor located near the tank also provides an alarm in the control room in the event of a leak.  The fill connection is located adjacent to the west side of the tank.\n\nThe tank, supported by a cradle, is located in a concrete secondary containment area, which has a containment capacity of 110% of the tank volume.  A portion of the aboveground ammonia steel piping is also located within the containment area. Catch basins, incorporated in the containment design, prevent spills and allow drainage of accumulated rainwater to the site's storm drain system.  The tank and secondary containment are visually inspected several times daily for leakage.\n\nRensselaer Cogen handles aqueous ammonia in quantities over the regulatory threshold of 20,000 pounds and falls under the Level 2 Program. Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical under the Risk Management Program. Aqueous ammonia enters Rensselaer Cogen by tanker truck. A maximum of 73,790  pounds of 29.4 percent aqueous ammonia (which is equivalent to 21,400 pounds of 100 percent ammonia gas) is stored onsite at any given time.\n\n\n Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios (' 68.155c)\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release that would cause an off-site impact. The RMP rule requires an off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a:\n\n         \"worst-case release scenario\" for one toxic substance and one flammable substance over the\n           regulatory thresholds which represents all regulated toxic substances and all regulated flammable \n           substances.

The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe USEPA recommended LandView III program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within this distance from the location of the storage tank. United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps and LandView (including MARPLOT. Mapping System) were utilized to identify the public, industrial, and environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nRensselaer Cogen's worst-case release scenario for aqueous ammonia is defined as an instantaneous  release of all the contents of the aqueous ammonia storage tank (73,790 pounds) and its subsequent vaporization (it would take approximately 3,236 minutes for the ammonia solution to completely volatilze if no cleanup measures were taken) as mandated by USEPA. Under the USEPA default worst weather conditions, this worst case toxic release impacts a distance of 3.4 miles before the concentration of ammonia was reduced to below 0.14 mg/L (which is the \"endpoint\" Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). The U.S. Census indicates that approximately 24,850 people live within this distance from the ammonia storage tank location. Several public receptors including schools, residences, parks, hospitals and commercial areas are located within this distance. USGS maps and LandView indicate that no environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" involves the release from a flexible 2- inch diameter transfer hose connection. The release duration was chosen to be 1 minute based on a reasonable response time to shut-off the tank outlet nozzle.
