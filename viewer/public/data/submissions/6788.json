      "SummaryText": "The Salem Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility owned by the City of Salem, IL and is located on Spillway Road on the north edge of Salem, IL.   The facility is manned by six (6) full time operators who are all experienced in the safe handling of toxic chemicals such as chlorine.  The plant uses chlorine as well as other chemicals to treat raw water from a reservoir and provide safe drinking water for the City of Salem.  The maximum quantity of chlorine handled by the Salem WTP is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance at the facility which is above the threshold limit.  Chemical safety is a concern of the Salem Water Treatment Plant and is attained by operators skilled in the handling of toxic chemicals as well as release prevention operations and an emergency response plan.  The facility has coordinated with the Salem Fire Protection District to implement an emergency response plan to be used in the event of an accidental chlorine release.  Safe chemicalhandling practices, as well as ongoing inspection and maintenance of the complete chlorination system has resulted in no accidental releases of chlorine within the last five years at the Salem Water Treatment Plant, however, a plan is in effect to handle an accidental release should such an event occur in the future.  A worst case scenario for the accidental release of chlorine has been developed for this facility using EPA and AWWA guidance.  This scenario models a 2,000 pound release of chlorine gas from a 1-ton chlorine container resulting from catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact or construction defects.  This release results in a distance to endpoint of 2.6 miles considering the urban topography at this location.  The residential population affected by this release is estimated to be 9,570 people.  Public receptors within the 2.6 mile radius include schools, residences, hospitals, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas.  Environmental receptors include the Sal"

      "SummaryText": "em Reservoir and Bryan Memorial Park.  Enclosures could possibly be considered as passive mitigation for this facility since the chlorine room is enlcosed, but was not considered in the modeling of the worst case scenario or alternate release scenario.  An alternate release scenario has also been developed for this facility using EPA and AWWA guidance.  This scenario considers a 317 pound chlorine gas release from a single 1-ton chlorine container due to tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure.  The location of this facility is considered to be urban, therefore the distance to endpoint is 0.48 miles.  The residential population within this radius is estimated to be 1,225 people.  Public receptors within this circle include schools, residences, hospitals and recreation areas.  Environmental receptors include Salem Reservoir and Bryan Memorial Park.  No passive mitigation or active mitigation systems were considered when developing the alternate release scenario.  The accidental release prevention program for the Salem Water Treatment Plant includes routine daily inspection of the complete chlorination system which results in maintenance performed on an as-needed basis.  The facility is equipped with a chlorine leak detector in the chlorination area with an audible and visible alarm within the plant.  The facility also has a portable chlorine monitor which can be used to check the chlorine concentration in areas around the perimeter of the facility in the event of an accidental release.  It is the policy of the facility that when 1-ton cylinders are changed, two operators, both wearing SCBA's, are used to complete the change in case of an accidental release.  The emergency response plan developed for the Salem Water Treatment Plant has been coordinated with the Salem Fire Protection District along with other local emergency responders.  The plan is designed to prepare WTP operators, as well as local emergency responders, for an accidental release of chlorine."

      "SummaryText": "The City Manager is responsible for implementation of the emergency response plan.  The plan includes specific actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release.  The Chief WTP Operator is responsible for responding to a chlorine leak alarm or the strong odor of chlorine by evacuating operators and notifying emergency responders. The Chief Operator, along with the Fire & Police Department, will determine the need for shelter or evacuation of the surrounding community depending on the severity of the chlorine release.  Emergency treatment of injuries will be handled by local paramedics that would be called on-site along with other emergency responders.\n\nIn conclusion, the Salem Water Treatment Plant is committed to providing safe drinking water to it's customers, as well as reducing the risk of an accidental release of chlorine through the use of safe chemical handling practices, ongoing inspections and preventitive maintenance.  In the event of an accidental chlorine release, the City of Salem is prepared to respond to the release with the Emergency Response Plan in order to minimize the impact of the release on the surrounding community and environment."
