      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nQCI is a custom chemical manufacturer whose primary business is in the manufacture of fine chemicals for the agrochemical, bulk pharmaceutical, polymer, and photoactive markets, but we welcome the opportunity to evaluate projects from other markets.  QCI was opened for business in 1976 by two entrepreneurs.  In 1986, QCI was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996.\n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 50,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well-equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  QCI's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9002 (Quality) and 14001 (Environmental) registered.\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.  Life and health are precious and must be safeguarded.  These beliefs compel us to conduct our business in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and the public....  The personal safety and health of each employee of this company and the general public of Tyrone is of primary importance.  The prevention of occupationally-induced injuries and illnesses is of such consequence that it will be given precedence whenever necessary.  QCI will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required"

Only one cylinder of chlorine and/or anhydrous hydrochloric acid is used at a time to feed the raw material to a batch.  In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA worst-case release scenario has been modeled for chlorine.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for chlorine, and the worst-case release scenario is being presented as the alternative release scenario for the other regulated substances; all of the releases have off-site impact.  For the worst-case scenario, a cylinder leaks and releases 2000 pounds of chlorine gas (the entire contents of the pressurized cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The impact distance hypothetically could be up to 1.3 miles during the worse possible weather conditions.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe production area and operating personnel are equipped with gas monitors to detect process leaks.  A chlorine transfer pipe fails during the transfer of chlorine.  QCI personnel respond and manually stop the chlorine release within 15 minutes.  Approximately 150 pounds of chlorine gas escapes as a vapor cloud.  The gas hypothetically migrates 0.1 miles before dissipating below the calculated endpoint concentration. \n\nFor anhydrous hydrochloric acid, a cylinder leaks and releases 600 pounds of hydrochloric acid gas (the entire contents of the pressurized cylinder) in 10 minutes.

(The amount of material in the 8000 gallon tank is limited to 7200 gallons by written operating procedures and high-level alarms.)  The liquid spills into a dike around the tank and evaporates over 10 minutes.  The concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of a pool.

The scenarios described above are hypothetical and have never occurred at this location.  There has never been an off-site injury or environmental impact resulting from an accidental release of these regulated substances.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND PREVETNION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nQCI prevents accidents at the plant by designing equipment for safe operation, installing and maintaining equipment in safe working order, training personnel to operate equipment safely, auditing to check and improve equipment and procedures, and maintaining a plant wide emergency response plan and in-plant emergency response personnel. \nIn addition, QCI complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, as required, and complies with the intent of the standard for all production projects.

The Engineering Department generates a P&ID for each project so that the R&M Department can install the equipment as designed.  The Engineering Department has determined the electrical classification for the various buildings and purchases equipment which meets these requirements.  The Engineering Department designs the general ventilation systems for the production buildings and designs the local ventilation systems throughout the plant.
