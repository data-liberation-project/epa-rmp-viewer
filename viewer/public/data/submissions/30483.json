We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with one 12,000-gallon tank, five 1,500-\r\ngallon nurse tanks, six 1,250-gallon nurse tanks, and thirty-eight 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our\r\nfacility in Berne, Indiana (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 70,550 gallons (363,050.3\r\npounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our\r\nfacility (the 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with the 12,000-gallon tank) contains 131,223 pounds\r\nat 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \r\n  4.
