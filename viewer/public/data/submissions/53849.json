It is our intent not only to comply with the mandatory parts of these safety regulations, but also with the spirit of them.  We have designed this PSM/RMP program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.  We are committed to its' purpose.  We ask all employees and contractors to perform to the spirit and requirements of this program by learning how your job is an integral part the PSM/RMP program, by performing your work to the PSM/RMP Program requirements, and by making suggestions to improve the Program.\n\nThe Williams Station Power Plant is located on the Cooper River in lower Berkeley County in the Bushy Park Industrial area near Charleston.  The power plant generates 680 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in a single unit.  The plant can use No. 2 fuel oil as a backup fuel to the coal.  In addition the plant can produce 50 megawatts of electricity from two No. 2 fuel oil combustion turbines.\n\nThe Williams Station Power Plant has a SCR de-Nox system to lower its Nox emissions.  The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the Nox compounds producing nitrogen and water.  The requirement for the addition of anhydrous ammonia necessitates the storage of large quantities of the ammonia.  The RMP program is initiated when a facility stores 10,000 lb. or more of anhydrous ammonia, which the Williams Station Power Plant will be doing.  The Williams Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be stored in two tanks each having a capacity of 60,000 gallons.  Administrative procedures will limit each tank to a maximum of 51,000 gallons or 85% of tank cap"

The facility has an emergency response team on site.  As part of complying with the above regulations an Emergency Response Plan will be developed in compliance with the regulations.  Many of the components of the plan currently exist as company operating procedures.   As part of the requirement for the RMP the following areas of concern will be addressed and implemented or updated as appropriate:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Employee Involvement\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Contractors\n* Pre-startup Safety Review\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Hot Work\n* Management of Change\n* Incident Investigation\n* Emergency Planning and Response\n* Compliance Audits\n\nThere have not been any release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response plan provides the contact name and phone number of the Berkeley County Emergency Management department (LEPC) as well as the phone numbers of the local fire department, hospital, police station and a hazardous waste response company to assist the company emergency response team on an as needed basis.  The plan also includes the following information:\n\n* Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment procedures to treat accidental human exposure to anhydrous ammonia.\n* Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n* Procedures for the use, inspection, testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment.\n* Training for employees response during an accidental spill.\n* Procedures to review and update the emergency response plan.\n* Coordination with th"
