This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 42,644 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  The Castillo Serralles (an historic building)is located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario:\r\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 lbs container, but throughout a pipe leak.  In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.2 miles 703 public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  there is a river within this radio area.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \r\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOPs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\r\n\r\nFive years Accident History:\r\nNo accident history has been reported during the last five years. \r\n\r\nP"

Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Ponce Vieja Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.
