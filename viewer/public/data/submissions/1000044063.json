The North Attleboro Wastewater Treatment Facility is committed to operating the facility in an environmentally responsible manner and to provide a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.\n\nThis Plan has been developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\".  The purpose of these provisions and this RMP is to prevent accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause harm to the public and to the environment.\n\n\n\nThis RMP was developed for the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility specifically to prevent and mitigate accidental releases associated with storage and handling operations of chlorine at the North Attleborough facility.  The RMP provides a summary of the risk management program implemented at the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility and was developed following the Environmental Protection Agency's guidance documents for the regulated chemical.  The RMP is available to government agencies and the public for review.\n\n\n\nTighe & Bond has performed the requisite review and regulatory update necessary for this covered facility on their five year RMP Submission Anniversary.  This review included:\n\n\n\nA:  A hazard analysis of the covered process based on a methodology involving checklists developed from EPA RMP Guidance, as well as a physical inspection of the covered process;\n\nB:  Performance of an off site consequence analysis (OCA) taking into account data revised from the year 2010 census; and\n\nC:  A general review of operating and maintenance procedures with facility operations and environmental personnel.\n\n\n\nThe following items provide an overview of the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility's RMP, in"

The chlorine is stored in a room equipped with ventilation and chlorine alarms.  The chlorine gas is mixed with water in the chlorinators and is directly injected into the treatment locations.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nA worst case release scenario and three alternative release scenarios have been evaluated and documented in the facility RMP files.  The worst case and alternative release scenarios were reevaluated for the five year anniversary, updating population and receptor information.  Based on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nAdministrative and Engineering Controls\n\nThe North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility has implemented a prevention program (RMP Program 2) to administratively limit the potential for a worst case or alternative release.  Specific measures employed in this program include safety reviews, hazard reviews, operating procedure reviews, training, maintenance and inspections.\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are conducted at least once every (3) three years based on the schedule contained in 40 CFR 68.58.  Hazard reviews are completed at least once every five (5) years, or sooner if major changes occur, based on the schedule contained in 40 CFR 68.50.  Maintenance and inspections are conducted on process equipment at specified intervals as outlined in the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility's RMP.  Documentation of the most recent reviews, audits, inspections and maintenance are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nCertain engineering controls are used to mitigate the potential effects of the alternative release scenario and are listed in Section 8.4.d of the RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accide"
