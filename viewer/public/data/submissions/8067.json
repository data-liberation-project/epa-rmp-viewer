Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Various Process Hazard Analysis Techniques are performed to identify and analyze the potential process hazards associated with handling hazardous chemicals. Corrective Action plans are then formed and implemented.\n\n3.  Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to insure their safe operation. These procedures are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary.\n\n4.  Employee Training - Training programs have been developed and implemented to insure all employees fully understand the hazards of the chemicals in use and the required safe handling procedures. The Plant has established an Operation Certification program to train, test and certify the employees who are operating chemical processes.\n\n5.  Contractors are evaluated to insure that they have the appropriate job skills, knowledge, training and certifications to perform tasks safety.\n\n6.  For New Processes -  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are conducted to insure a safe transition into the normal operating mode.\n\n7.  A Mechanical Integrity program is in place to insure the integrity of process equipment. Elements include the following:\n- identification and categorization of equipment and instrumentation\n- inspections and tests\n- establishment of prescribed inspection frequencies\n- development and application of maintenance procedures\n- training of maintenance personnel\n- documentation of test and inspection results\n- documentation of manufacturer's maintenance recommendations\n\n8.   A Hot Work Permit System is in place to manage welding, cutting or brazing of equipment in process areas to prevent fire or explosions.\n\n9.

All recommendations are documented and tracked through completion.\n\n11.   A highly trained, on shift, Emergency Response Team is prepared to respond to chemical release events.\n\n12.   The Plant has a detailed Equipment Isolation Program to insure all equipment has been safed out prior to performing any maintenance and return to service activities and to prevent accidental releases.\n\n13.   Compliance Audits are performed to review all relevant documentation, verify process safety information and inspect the physical facilities.\n\nAdditionally, the Plant has completed an analysis of system Year 2000 compliance issues (Y2K) and has actions in-place to insure uninterrupted safe operations.\n\n\nV.   Five Year Accident History\n\nAccidents Involving RMP Chemicals\n\nDuring the past five years, the BFGoodrich Avon Lake Plant has had no chemical releases/accidents involving anhydrous ammonia or acrylonitrile. \n\n\nVI.   Emergency Response Programs\n\nThe BFGoodrich Performance Materials has the following policies/procedures/plans in effect for use in mounting a response to the release of chemicals:\n-  Fire and Other Emergencies\n-  Government Reportable Releases Emergency Notification\n-  Internal BFG Management Notification of Emergency Events\n-  Integrated Contingency Plan\n-  Spill Prevention Control and Countenance Plan (SPCC)\n-  RCRA Contingency Plan\n\n\nThe Plant has a comprehensive notification system in place to initiate response to any emergency. Key personnel are notified by a system of pagers and alarms. Once this notification system is activated, a series of emergency plans follow. For example, in the event of a fire, the Emergency Response Team will respond and an on-site Chain of Command communication system is implemented. The Emergency Response Team is trained to deal with chemical releases and emerge"

Additionally, the Plant is a member in good standing of the Chemical Manufacturer's Association and the Ohio Chemical Council.  In 1998, the Plant received two Ohio Chemical Council Annual Awards, one for Pollution Prevention and the second for Community Awareness and Emergency Response.\n\nAt this location the toxic chemicals present that are in excess of the applicable regulatory threshold quantity are: (1) acrylonitrile and (2) anhydrous ammonia. There are no RMP flammable chemicals present at this location in excess of the applicable regulatory threshold quantity.\n\nIII.  Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including a discussion of administrative and mitigative measures used to minimize the affects of the release are described below.  One worst case release scenario is provided for the Plant, i.e., the scenario with the farthest endpoint, and an alternative release scenario is provided for each toxic chemical.  The distinguishing differences between the two types of scenarios are: (1) the USEPA specifically defines the parameters of the worst case releases scenario and (2) only the alternative release scenario takes into account the accident/release prevention measures that are in-place to prevent and mitigate any release.\n\nA.  Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe USEPA defined worst case scenario for the Plant, involves a complete failure of the acrylonitrile storage tank during which the maximum contents (24,000 gallons) are released within 10 minutes. This scenario does not take into consideration any of the multi-layered prevention measures that are in-place to prevent this release scenario from occurring and therefore is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nBased on the USEPA Consequence Analysis Model, the wor"

Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe alternative release scenarios were developed and selected in accordance with a risk based protocol.  This protocol uses the process HAZOPS and integrates the likelihood of occurrence and the offsite severity potential into the scenario selection process.  The alternative release scenarios are:\n\n-  A two minute release from the acrylonitrile tank due to overfilling.  This scenario assumes that all or some of the following accident/release prevention measures fail:\n-  The administrative inventory control system fails and an acrylonitrile shipment is received for unloading prior to having sufficient freeboard to unload the delivery.\n-  The tank level devices fail to detect the correct level in the tank thus there is insufficient freeboard in the tank to accept a delivery.\n-  The redundant high level tank alarms fail to automatically stop the loading pumps when a high level condition is reached.\n-  The loading attendant does not stop loading the tank for two minutes after the overfilling is initiated.\n\n-  A sixty minute release from a pipe leak in the ammonia supply line.  This scenario assumes that all or some of the following accident/release prevention measures fail:\n-  The excess flow valve does not function.\n-  The mechanical integrity program fails to prevent and detect corrosion leading to the leak.\n-  The time required to respond to the release is sixty minutes.\n\nBoth of the alternative release scenarios have an off-site impact. \n\nIV.  Accident and Release Prevention Programs\n\nThe BFGoodrich Performance Materials Avon Lake Plant has several programs in place, which are specifically focused on preventing the accidental release of chemicals. These programs are consistent with Plant and BFGoodrich policies and with the Occupational Safety and Health Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) for highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nThese programs are:\n\n1.
