This management system is utilized to provide the necessary organizational structure, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures and resources for developing, implementing, achieving, reviewing and maintaining compliance with the EPA's RMP rules.  This RMP will be utilized to:\na) implement, maintain and improve our Process Safety Management System;\nb) assure itself of its compliance with the stated rules of the EPA's RMP;\nc) demonstrate such compliance to all affected employees and the surrounding community;\nd) make self-determinations and declarations of compliance with the RMP rules utilizing the existing internal audit system within the Process Safety Management System.\nAll requirements of this rule are intended to be incorporated into this RMP.  The extent of application is dependent on such factors as the required hazard assessments, the worst-case release scenarios, alternative case scenarios, and the 5-year Accident History as they relate to the Mont Belvieu Facility operations.\n1.1    Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\nThe RMP rule requires an executive summary within the RMPlan.  This executive summary will address the following requirements:\n? Accidental release and response policies\n? Description of the stationary source and regulated substances\n? Offsite consequences analysis results\n? General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n? Five-year accident history\n? Emergency response program information\n? Planned changes to improve safety\nThe level of detail within this summary will reflect site-specific needs as they pertain to the different operating areas of the Mont Belvieu Facility.  The following is a summation of how Diamond-Koch will meet the aforementioned requirements of the RMP Rule.\n 1.2 Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nThe Diamond-Koch Mont Belvieu Facility has a lo"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained Emergency Response Team personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n1.3    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nAt the Mont Belvieu Facilities {located 32 miles northeast of Houston, Texas}, Diamond-Koch stores and distributes natural gas liquids.  In addition, the company now owns and operates three Polymer Grade Propylene Splitter Units {Propylene Units} and the Bay Area Pipeline that distributes the finished product to downstream customers.  In addition to the Propylene Units, Diamond-Koch is also comprised of the East and West Storage Operations totaling thirty-one underground hydrocarbon storage wells.  These wells are used in conjunction with incoming and outgoing piping systems to supply storage and distribution of natural gas liquids for area petrochemical customers.\nCurrently there are no toxic substances that are used, manufactured, or stored at this facility that meet the RMP threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs.\nThe Mont Belvieu Facilities have several regulated flammables, such as ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, refinery grade propylene and polymer grade propylene.  The Mont Belvieu Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Diamond-Koch identified the regulated substances and quantities maintained on site.  The chemicals, maximum inventories on site, and their threshold quantities are presented in Table 1 below.\nTABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substances\nRegulated Substances or Mixtures Contai"

The corrective action tracking and closure documentation is accessible by all personnel via the PRiSM electronic information transfer system.\nFor more detailed information regarding the Diamond-Koch PSM Compliance Audit Program, please refer to the Facility Process Safety Management Manual.\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe processes at the Diamond-Koch Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention (PSM) program summarized previously is applied to all Program Level # 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at the Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Facility has safety features on the Propylene Units and throughout the Storage Facilities to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various areas/processes:\nRelease Detection:\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms connected to the respective control rooms."

      "SummaryText": "\nRelease Containment/Control:\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and/or automated)\n3. Automated emergency shutdown systems for specific process parameters (i.e., high level, high temperature, high pressure etc.)\n4. Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (i.e., knockout drum)\n5. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n6. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., un-interruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n7. Atmospheric relief devices\n Release Mitigation:\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n2. Deluge system for specific equipment\n3. Trained emergency response and rescue personnel\n4. Personal protective equipment (i.e., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe Diamond-Koch Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  To assist in protecting the environment the Facility has also implemented an ISO-14001 Environmental Management System which dovetails with the Emergency Response Program to ensure public safety.  The Emergency Response program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and (if necessary) decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions"

Employees receive {HAZWOPER} training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The Emergency Response Program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Facility.  The Emergency Response Program changes are administered through the monthly Safety Training which is utilized to inform and train all affected personnel in the changes.\nThe overall emergency response program for the Facility is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Group and the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of these committees, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has 24-hour communications capability with the appropriate MAMB and LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic MAMB and LEPC meetings, the Facility conducts annual emergency response drills that involve the MAMB Group and LEPC organizations.  The Facility also provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the Facilities.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe Diamond-Koch Facility resolves all findings from PHAs, MOCs and Incident Investigations, some of which result in modifications to the various processes.  The following types of changes are planned:\n? Additional hydrocarbon release detection systems in the Propylene Units\n? Upgrade of the flare systems\n? Upgrade of the piping systems at the Storage Facilities\n? Constant review and revisions to the operating procedures and training programs leading to constant improvement process.\n Risk Management Plan Data Elements Checklist\n1.0    Registration\n1.1    Source Identification\na.
