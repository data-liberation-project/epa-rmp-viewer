However, Diamond-Koch has determined that natural gasoline has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 3 which exempts this mixture from the threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analyses of the regulated substances, the distances to endpoints (i.e., an overpressure of 1 psi) exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial, commercial and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas, inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, the Diamond-Koch Facility is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM).  Therefore, the Diamond-Koch Mont Belvieu Facility is classified as a Program Level 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n1.4\tHazard Assessment Results\nToxic Substances:\tN/A\nAs stated above, no toxic substances were identified as meeting the criteria or threshold limits of the RMP Rule.

      "SummaryText": "verpressure (i.e., 14.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems were not applied.\nThe distances to the endpoints of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case releases of ethane and refinery grade propylene, using the EPA equations are presented in Table 2.  Ethane is the worst-case flammable release which will have an off-site impact.

In addition, the company now owns and operates three Polymer Grade Propylene Splitter Units {Propylene Units} and the Bay Area Pipeline that distributes the finished product to downstream customers.  In addition to the Propylene Units, Diamond-Koch is also comprised of the East and West Storage Operations totaling thirty-one underground hydrocarbon storage wells.  These wells are used in conjunction with incoming and outgoing piping systems to supply storage and distribution of natural gas liquids for area petrochemical customers.\nCurrently there are no toxic substances that are used, manufactured, or stored at this facility that meet the RMP threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs.\nThe Mont Belvieu Facilities have several regulated flammables, such as ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, refinery grade propylene and polymer grade propylene.  The Mont Belvieu Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Diamond-Koch identified the regulated substances and quantities maintained on site.  The chemicals, maximum inventories on site, and their threshold quantities are presented in Table 1 below.\nTABLE 1\nLargest Quantity of Regulated Substances\nRegulated Substances or Mixtures Contai"

This management system is utilized to provide the necessary organizational structure, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures and resources for developing, implementing, achieving, reviewing and maintaining compliance with the EPA's RMP rules.  This RMP will be utilized to:\na) implement, maintain and improve our Process Safety Management System;\nb) assure itself of its compliance with the stated rules of the EPA's RMP;\nc) demonstrate such compliance to all affected employees and the surrounding community;\nd) make self-determinations and declarations of compliance with the RMP rules utilizing the existing internal audit system within the Process Safety Management System.\nAll requirements of this rule are intended to be incorporated into this RMP.  The extent of application is dependent on such factors as the required hazard assessments, the worst-case release scenarios, alternative case scenarios, and the 5-year Accident History as they relate to the Mont Belvieu Facility operations.\n1.1\tRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\nThe RMP rule requires an executive summary within the RMPlan.  This executive summary will address the following requirements:\n\u00d8 Accidental release and response policies\n\u00d8 Description of the stationary source and regulated substances\n\u00d8 Offsite consequences analysis results\n\u00d8 General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\u00d8 Five-year accident history\n\u00d8 Emergency response program information\n\u00d8 Planned changes to improve safety\nThe level of detail within this summary will reflect site-specific needs as they pertain to the different operating areas of the Mont Belvieu Facility.  The following is a summation of how Diamond-Koch will meet the aforementioned requirements of the RMP Rule.\n 1.2 Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nThe Diamond-Koch Mont Belvieu Facility has a lo"
