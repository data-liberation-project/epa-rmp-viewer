If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nA.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThis facility strives to exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations.  Training is provided for each employee upon initial hire and annually thereafter.  The anhydrous ammonia process is inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies. \n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 247,486 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tank and 28 nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nC.    Worst-case release scenario and the Alternative release scenario\n\n\n\nA.    The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 128,010 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n\n\nB.    The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 14.29 minute release from a break in a 1 inch trans"

In addition, Minnesota Department of Agriculture Rules, \"Chapter 1513\".\n\n\n\nE.    5-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nF.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standards, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nb.    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111(EPCRA).\n\nc.    Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nG.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nManagement of this company and facility continually look for ways to enhance the safety of this location.
