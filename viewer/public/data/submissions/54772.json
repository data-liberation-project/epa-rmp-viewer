      "SummaryText": "Release prevention and emergency response policies\nPersonnel at this City of Bristol (City) facility take a very active approach in maintaining and improving chemical safety.  This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use chlorine in ton containers.  The policy at this facility is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, the policy is to notify the Bristol City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nThis facility is a water treatment plant located in Bristol, Connecticut.  The plant employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: rapid mixing, three-stage flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and storage in reservoirs.  Chlorine is the regulated substance used to disinfect the water prior to storage.  The covered process includes the storage and feed of chlorine. \n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  The release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 3 processes.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state and local laws.  To achieve and maintain this compliance, the City has in place procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include sensors, alarms, and manual shutoffs.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine, or at least minimize the effects of a r"

      "SummaryText": "elease.\n\nFive-year accident history\nThis facility has not had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThe facility has a written emergency action plan that is coordinated with local emergency responders.  The Bristol Fire Department is the primary responder.  City employees can handle incidental releases of chlorine.\n\nThe emergency action plan includes disaster and emergency situation identification, escape procedures, procedures to account for all personnel after an emergency evacuation, and rescue and medical duties. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Safety training takes place throughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like the process hazard analysis or upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for implementation.  This process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course.   Currently, the recommendations made during the recent process hazard analysis are under consideration."
