All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response to emergency conditions within the facility in addition, to testing the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (EOC).  In addition, the Louisville facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (SSP) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan will link the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the Louisville Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), which includes industrial and public entities.  See RMP*Submit file submittal for details of Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (\u00c2\u00a7 68.155(g))\n\nThe Louisville facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees."
