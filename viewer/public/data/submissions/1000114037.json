The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and forms the Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The GCC PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of GCC to protect its employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and property have been established.  \n\nA \u0093Non-responding facility\u0094 policy has been adopted; however, the Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (San Luis Obispo County CUPA) and the California Dept of Forestry Fire Department.  Appropriate reports such as the California Hazardous Material Business Plan are filed with these Agencies at required intervals.  Relationships with the local CUPA and Fire Department have been established.  Qualified personnel trained beyond 1910.120(q) Awareness Level would support the Public Responders in the event of an emergency.\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGuadalupe Cooling Company (GCC) is a refrigeration plant located 1.7 miles north of"
