Due to the number of safety features put in place to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the environment and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system would pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\n\n\nC. Description of Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n1. Employee Participation:\n\nThis program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.\n\nThe program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\n\n2. Process Safety Information:\n\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system. This written information includes the SDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system. The written information also includes the SDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, and basic information about the chemistry of the refrigeration system, and the thermodynamic properties of the refrigeration system.\n\n3. Process Hazards Analysis:\n\nA formal analysis using the What-If/Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards. For each Management of Change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\n\n4.
