This\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control\nand contain the release.\n\nThe Madison gas plant, located approximately 6 miles WNW of North Zulch in Madison County,\nTexas, produces natural gas liquids from natural gas. These natural gas liquids are comprised\nprimarily of ethane, propane and butane. Some of the chemicals produced or used include\nmethane, ethane, propane, and butane.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the Madison gas plant above the EPA Threshold Quantity.\nThe threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if\nstored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations.\nGenerally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is\nlittle danger to the public.\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold\nquantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane and butane.\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud\nexplosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 30,000 gallon storage tank containing natural\ngas liquids. Assuming the material in the tank is primarily propane, the distance away from the\nplant affected in this worst-case scenario would be approximately 0.43 miles, based on EPA\nanalysis. \n\nA more probable release scenario would involve the release of natural gas liquids f"

Based on normal production of approximately 75,000\ngallons of natural gas liquids per day, we would release approximately 800 gallons in 15 minutes,\nat which time our operators would detect and isolate the line. The affected distance based on EPA\nguidance is approximately 0.12 miles, or approximately 650 feet. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Madison gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based on\nthe OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. A summary of some of the accident\nprevention programs that are in place follows.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Madison gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes. These documents include material safety data sheets for all chemicals\non-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all vessels\nand equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with written\nprocedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance\nactivities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety\nfeatures in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Madison gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with\nthe various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined to\nidentify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The\nwhat-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are\nconducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.\nThis team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and\nmitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures\nwhen the team"

All approved recommendations from the\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate\nsignificantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where\nappropriate, the Madison gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\nThese periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Madison gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\noperations. These procedures are used as reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis\nfor consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified\nas current and accurate.\n\n\nTraining\n\nOur employees at the Madison plant have an average experience of more than 15 years. This level\nof experience provides a great level of expertise throughout the facility. Ongoing training is\naccomplished through routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new processes and refresher\ntraining on operating procedures. \n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Madison gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased\nmaintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety and health\nhazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\nIn addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the\nselection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor performance to ensure\nthat contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Madison gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our equipment in\na safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include inspections, tests and\ncorrections of identified deficiencies. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure"

If\na deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back\nin service or they will determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the\nequipment.\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Madison gas plant has long-standing safe work practices to help ensure worker and process\nsafety. Examples of these include lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for\nequipment that is being worked on, a permit and procedure for hot work and a permit and\nprocedure for confined space entry. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected\npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed\nsafely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Madison gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.\nThis system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\n(including operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and\nauthorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are\nin place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been\ncompromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary\ntraining on the change.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Madison gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or\npersonal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective\nactions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Madison gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\nsafe operation.

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to\nperform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated\nwhen necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Madison gas plant is coordinated with the local\nemergency response organizations and the emergency planning committee. This coordination\nprovides a means to notify the public in case of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating\nquick response to an incident. The facility has had a joint simulation drill with the local emergency\nplanning coordinator of Madison County and several local emergency response agencies. Not only\ndid we learn more about their capability, but they became more familiar with our operations and\nhow to respond in case of an incident.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Madison gas plant has had very safe operations over its history. However, the facility\ncontinually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. Our\ncompany is very active in promoting coordination between the local emergency response agencies\nand our facility personnel. Ongoing communication between our facility and the emergency\nresponders is an integral part of our operations."
