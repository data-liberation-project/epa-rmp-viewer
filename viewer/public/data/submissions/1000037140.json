[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the facility in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane product.  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the facility.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Karnes Central Delivery Point does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the facility does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure for flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  The Ethane-Propane-Butane-Pentane Mix was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of the entire inventory in the largest storage vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would not have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the EPA's RMP* Comp &trade; dispersion modeling.\n\n\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.

Use of appropriate site-specific and job-specific personal protective equipment.\n\n7. A methodical procedure termed as Job Safety Analysis (JSA) for ensuring that the proper precautions are in place prior to undertaking any non-routine tasks.\n\n\n\nThese safe work practices and procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system designed to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely at all times.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Karnes Central Delivery Point promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire or explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and underlying cause(s) of the incident to develop corrective actions and implement steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident and prevent similar incidents.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent similar incidents, and forwards these results to management for further action. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are fully implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the Risk Management Program is functioning properly, the Karnes Ce"
