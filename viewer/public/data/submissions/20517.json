      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nThe Coors Brewing Company (CBC) operates a brewing, blending, finishing, and packaging facility in \nMemphis, Tennessee (Memphis facility).  The facility uses ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Use of \nammonia is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning \nregulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM \nregulations, the facility is considered to be a stationary source.  The regulated toxic chemical at the \nstationary source is ammonia.\n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan which form the basis of the \nRM program for the Memphis facility.  EPA?s five key regulatory requirements for a RM program are:\n\n1) Management Plan\n2) Hazard Assessment\n3) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n4) Emergency Response\n5) Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\n\nThis RM plan is based on the requirements listed above and is organized to reflect them in five sections, as \nsummarized below.\n\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\nThe RM Program Manager for CBC is a Senior Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) Manager who \nreports to the Director, Core Environment, Health, Safety, and Energy (EHSE), who, in turn, reports to the \nVice President, Engineering and Technical Services.  The RM Program Manager is assisted by a Process \nSafety Management (PSM) Coordinator and an EHS representative.  The PSM Coordinator is responsible \nfor the accidental release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration process.  Utility supervisors, \nmaintenance supervisors, operators, engineers, and staff level personnel also execute component activities to maintain compliance with RM regulations.  At Memphis, individuals have been assigned responsibility for all five requirements of the RM program, including management, hazard assessment, prevention, eme"

      "SummaryText": "rgency planning, and RM plan updates.\n\nReguirement 2.  Hazard Assessment\nPotential accidental releases of ammonia were modeled to evaluate possible offsite impacts. Modeling \nprocedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case release scenarios (WCS) and alternate case \nrelease scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations.  EPA personnel freely admit that the \nassumptions used for WCS are not realistic and in some cases are not physically possible.  However, EPA \nguidance was followed and toxic and flammable endpoints were identified.  The WCSs were identified by \ncomparing the results for each ammonia or chlorine system and selecting the scenario that resulted in the \ngreatest distance to the toxic or flammable endpoint.  The number of offsite permanent residents located \ninside a circle (centered on the release point with a radius equal to the endpoint) was then estimated using \nEPA?s Landview III software (Version 1.0).  The offsite population estimates do not include 502 CBC \nemployees at Memphis.  RM Regulations require reporting of a WCS and ACS for each regulated process \nthat could impact different offsite populations.\n\nA release of 17,500 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes was identified as the WCS for the ammonia \nrefrigeration process.  This WCS would produce a toxic endpoint (defined as 200 parts per million [ppm] \nammonia) of 2.4 miles.  An estimated offsite population of  35,000 is located within this radius.\n\nTo develop more realistic estimates of offsite impacts, as required by RM regulations, several ACSs were  \nevaluated for the ammonia refrigeration system. The ACS selected for presentation in this document and \nfor reporting to EPA was selected based on industry recommendations and likelihood of occurrence.  The \nselected ACS consists of a ?-inch Schedule 80 pipe failure, which contains liquid ammonia under pressure.  This results in an endpoint distance of 0.65 miles.  An estimated offsite population of 260 is located within this radius.\n\nI"

      "SummaryText": "n the past five years, none of the processes subject to RM regulations have had releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases or fire. \n\nRequirement 3.  Prevention Program\nThe Memphis facility has a chemical release prevention program for ammonia.  The prevention programs \nfor the ammonia process were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119).  Key provisions of the release \nprevention program are as follows.\n\nFor the ammonia refrigeration process (which is subject to the PSM standard), EPA requires a Program 3 \nprevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0:\n\n- Employee Participation\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Contractors\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Management of Change\n- Incident Investigation\n- Compliance Audits\n\nRequirement 4.  Emergency Response \nThe emergency response program at the facility is initiated by CBC personnel who are all trained to \nrecognize ammonia releases and immediately inform the Safety Department.  Ammonia gas sensors/alarms \nare present at five locations that automatically trigger audible alarms and alert the Safety Department if \nammonia is detected.  Employees contact the Safety Department using radio contact since channel #1 is \nmaintained for this purpose 24 hours per day.  CBC personnel not carrying radios who notice a release are to clear the area immediately and notify their supervisor, or others who carry radios so they can inform the Safety Department.\n\nThe Safety Department has nine (Incident Command Level) trained individuals (at least one is onsite) who \nare sent to the scene to assess the situation and engage the proper internal and external emergency response personnel and equipment.

The AHJ will initially be the City of \nMemphis Fire Department.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the \nscene that include the Shelby County Hazardous Materials Team, Shelby County Sheriff, Tennessee State \nPatrol, and other agencies, as needed.  These external agencies are responsible for evacuation of nearby \nbusinesses should the situation require it.\n\nRequirement 5.  RM Plan and Data Elements\nThe specific data elements required to be electronically reported to EPA are included in Section 5.0.  The \ndata elements are supported by this RM plan which documents and provides additional details for each RM \nregulatory requirement.  Section 5 consists of a complete printout from EPA?s RMP Submit software."
