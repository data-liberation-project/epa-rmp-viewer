It is assumed that the entire contents of the largest vessel, without management controls, is  released within 10 minutes as a two phase flow.  \nDistance to endpoint: 2.3 miles\nPopulation:  20,300\n\n\nAlternative Scenario  (endpoint based on RMP*Comp ver 1.07; population from \nMARPLOT 4.0.1)\n\nThe alternative scenario that is considered most likely is a \u00c2\u00be\u00c2\u00bf relief valve failure [68.28(b)(2)(iv)] lasting 240 minutes.  This would be a release of 1,782 lbs/hr of ammonia for four hours.  Total release is 7,128 pounds.  \nDistance to endpoint: 0.14 miles (247 yards).  \nPopulation affected is 18.\n\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis O. K. Foods facility has not had a reportable accident in the last five years. \n\n\n5. THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Alan Risley, Plant 2 Manager. Mr. Risley will administrate in conjunction with the O. K. Foods management and personnel. Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Sebastian County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe O. K. Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule. Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs. Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training. They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are able to demonstrate proper job\nskills and knowledge.\n\n\n7.

Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually. Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.

Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions. O. K. Foods strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community. We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as\nnearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations. Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.  \n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies. We work in conjunction with the Fort Smith Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products. We utilize one regulated substance:  anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing. An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks. Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. O.K. Foods has four independent systems at this site. The largest system contains 82,578 pounds of ammonia.  The total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 96,507 pounds.  \n\n3.
