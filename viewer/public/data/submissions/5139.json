Davenport, FL Distribution Center\n\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia to customers via trailers..  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ammonia (aqueous) both of which are sold to customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 358738.50 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous >20%) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 136765.86 lb.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammonia Storage.  In this scenario 160000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.    At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14 miles is obtained corresponding to"

      "SummaryText": "a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Anhydrous Ammonia Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 2380.22 lb. of anhydrous ammonia .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.43 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3299 lb. of aqueous ammonia .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as the dike are taken into account to calculate the scenario. The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.43 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLaRoche Industries Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associat"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/26/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LaRoche Industries Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLaRoche Industries Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLaRoche Industries Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at LaRoche Industries Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technol"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LaRoche Industries Inc..  The most recent review was performed on 11/01/1997.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLaRoche Industries Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 06/25/1998.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLaRoche Industries Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLaRoche Industries Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
