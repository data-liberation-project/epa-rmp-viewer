This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nDescription - Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n \nThe ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery, located at 401 South 23rd Street, Billings, Montana is owned and operated by ConocoPhillips Company. The refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (for example, propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. In addition, the refinery processes hydrocarbons using Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), a regulated substance.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nAll scenarios were reviewed by ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery personnel and verfied as being appplicable to current operating parameters.\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThe ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. The frequency of all-accidental releases and injuries to our employees has decreased during this period. We investigate every incident thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring and keep records of all incidents that occur at our facility. No incidents have occurred that have resulted in off-site impact during this time. In addition, there have been no on-site incidents involving a covered process that resulted in an RMP reportable accident since our last RMP submission.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program"

Additional information about our Mechanical Integrity (MI) program can be found in our site Mechanical Integrity Systems Manual and specific MI procedures.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Billings Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The refinery recognized techniques to perform these evaluations. All our PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations for additional prevention and safety measures or design changes when the team believes such actions are necessary.\n\nLocal management reviews the PHA Team recommendations, and employees are assigned accountability to resolve all recommendations that have been made by the PHA team and accepted by local management. The PHA Team prioritizes implementation of recommendations in response to PHA findings. All approved recommendations being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. After completion of the specific PHA a final report is issued that all affected employees can access. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.

Emergency shutdown procedures include the conditions requiring shutdown and assign responsibility for determining when to initiate an emergency shutdown to appropriate personnel.  Unit Operators have the authority to shut down any process for safety concerns.\n\nThese procedures are used by all operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. All procedures are periodically reviewed with a mandatory minimum review period of 36 months. Refinery management annually certifies that all operating procedures are current and accurate. We use our management of change procedure to track changes to procedures when the MOC identifies a need for procedural changes as a result of the change.  Procedures are readily available to operators in the process and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Additional information, including management responsibilities, can be found in our PSM administrative procedure that outlines this element, PSM Procedures Program, (PSM-ADM-05).\n\nTraining\n\nThe ConocoPhillips Billings Refinery employs a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.
