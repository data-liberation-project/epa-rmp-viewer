      "SummaryText": "The City of Altus, Oklahoma in conjunction with the local public schools operates a public swimming facility located within the city limits in the eastern portion of the city. The facility uses chlorine to treat the waters of the pools.   The swimming facility holds safety as its first priority, especially when it comes to chlorine. The maximum inventory is 2 tons and the swimming facility limits the maximum number of cylinders in use at any one time to two. The worst case scenario for the swimming facility is a 1 ton cylinder resulting in an estimated Level of Concern (LOC) of 1.2 miles using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. The first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose (whip) from the cylinder to the header pipe. This is an estimated LOC of .99 miles and a release of approximately 1,000 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario most likely to occur. The second alternate scenario is a release representative of a culmination of both the previous scenarios. This could occur if a tank ruptured and other tanks were able, due to failure of controls, to flow back along the header pipe and out the broken transfer hose (whip). This would result in the release of approximately 1.5 tons of chlorine and result in a LOC footprint of 1.4 miles. The swimming facility follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance program, to minimize the likelihood of an accident occurring at the facility. Because of the strict implementation of the above mentioned programs, this facility has not had a release within the past ten years. The Altus swimming facility holds training and refresher courses for the personnel at the facility regarding the chlorine system and its concerns. However, If an accident occurred, the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Altus Fire Department would be notified and would respond immediately. The Altus swimming facility has no current plans to change the chlorine process in the forseeable future."
