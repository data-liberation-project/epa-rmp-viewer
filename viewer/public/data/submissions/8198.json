The facility provides response training for its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances\n\nThe Hampton Facility manufactures high pressure decorative and industrial laminates.  As part of this manufacturing process, the facility handles one regulated substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. \n\nProcess:                       Resin Manufacturing\nProgram Level:              3\nRegulated Substance:  Formaldehyde\nProcess Quantity:        41,878 gallons\n\n3.  Off-site Consequences Analysis\n\nThe Hampton Facility performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The off site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario, since the Hampton Facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  The alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Hampton Facility and (2) would result in the greatest potential off site consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which the public might be affected because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.

When a hazardous substance is used at the Hampton Facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe Hampton Facility limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Workers are trained to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the facility works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety and environmental program at the Hampton Facility consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety and environmental program at the Hampton Facility that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Hampton Facility is committed to the safety of its employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The facility implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the Hampton Facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Hampton Facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for its employees and will help p"

As part of this commitment, the Hampton Facility has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nThe risk management program includes:\n\n1.  a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see sections 3 and 5;\n2.  an accidental release prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see section  4;\n3.  an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see section 6.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program at the Hampton Facility.  In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of hazardous substances, and associated injuries and damage.\n\nThe Hampton Facility limits the use of hazardous substances.

Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off site consequence analysis performed by the Hampton Facility.\n\n3.1  The worst-case release scenario for formaldehyde is the catastrophic failure of one of the storage tanks resulting in a release of 120,000 pounds of aqueous (37%) formaldehyde in 10 minutes.  The release of this quantity of 37% formaldehyde solution will likely form a pool, and the impact of the worst case scenario assumes evaporation of formaldehyde from that pool.  The modeled endpoint for the potential release would impact residences and industrial areas.\n\n3.2  The alternative release scenario for formaldehyde is a liquid spill due to a leak in a flange or valve.  This scenario assumes a one gallon per minute release of 37 percent aqueous formaldehyde that is discovered and stopped within 30 minutes with spill cleanup occurring within one hour after release is stopped.  The modeled endpoint for the potential release would impact residences and industrial facilities.  \n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince International Paper acquired the Hampton Facility from its previous owner in 1995, International Paper has improved the facility's prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The process is covered by the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the prevention program for this process consists of the 14 elements of process safety management as required by OSHA 1910.119.

All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change procedure to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n4.7.  Pre-startup Review.  The Hampton Facility performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n4.8.  Compliance Audits.  International Paper audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of the operations.  International Paper assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n4.9.  Incident Investigation.  The Hampton Facility investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within forty-eight (48) hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.10.  Employee Participation.

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\n4.11.  Hot Work Permits.  The Hampton Facility's hot work permit program is designed to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions.  International Paper created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29CFR 1910.252(a) and insurance requirements .  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to obtain a Hot Work Permit prior to work being performed.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit is conducted for all affected employees at the facility.\n\n4.12.  Contractors.  The Hampton Facility established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner.  The safety  record of contractors is reviewed  to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The facility explains to the contractors the hazards of the process on which they will work, the facility's safe work practices, and the facility's emergency response procedures.  The facility periodically audits the work performance of the contractor to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Hampton Facility has implemented safety features specific to formaldehyde.  Industry standards are followed at the Hampton Facility to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  The formaldehyde is delivered to the facility from the neighboring Georgia Pacific Plant.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Hampton Facility experienced one release of formaldehyde that went off site over the past five (5) years.  On October 5, 1995, a resin manufacturing kettle over pressurized.  This over pressurization resulted in the release of resin to the ambient air via a safety vent.  The release came in contact with two neighboring manufacturing facilities.  Small drops of resin were observed on parked cars, building structures, and storage tanks.  International Paper hired a contractor to cleanup the drops of resin.  Four employees of one of the neighboring facilities came in contact with the resin during the release.  Three employees were sent to the local hospital for examinations.  No injuries were noted from the release.  The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) responded to the release.\n\nThe Hampton Facility conducted an incident investigation and implemented operating procedural changes to the manufacturing of resins to enhance the safety of this process.  A receiving tank was also installed.    \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Hampton Facility's written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [e.g., OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)] and has been communicated to local emergency response officials.
