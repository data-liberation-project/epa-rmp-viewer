Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility receives and stores chemicals used primarily for water treatment and the marine industry.  This facility handles only one chemical, cyclohexylamine, which is regulated by the USEPA Risk Management Program regulations.  Cyclohexylamine is received in heavy-duty stainless-steel containers, diluted with water in a blend tank, and transferred to smaller containers that are sold to our customers.  The threshold quantity of cyclohexylamine is only exceeded in the flammable storage area.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest "

Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  The operations at this facility are ISO 9002 certified.  The ISO program ensures rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in the event of an emergency. \n \nFive-year accident history: \n\nWe have never had an accident involving cyclohexylamine that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.  We have never had any significant spill of cyclohexylamine at our facility.\n  \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees do not respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substances, but rely on local emergency responders when there is a need for response.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.
