By Corporate policy, we operate safely and with concern for the environment.  We take this responsibility seriously.  The facility is designed following recognized design practices and procedures.  Detailed operating procedures and training assure that the facility will be operated safely during normal and emergency situations.  A sophisticated control system monitors the operation of the plant and if necessary an emergency shut down system will accomplish a safe and orderly shut down.  The facility has conducted process hazard analyses to determine the risks that exist in our process and opportunities to reduce those risks.  EOTT Energy Liquids, Morgan's Point Complex uses modern maintenance practices, tools and systems to keep equipment operating reliably and detect repair needs in their early stages.  To improve equipment reliability, the facility conducts mechanical integrity inspections and failure analysis to determine the root cause of failures.  Qualified personnel who have been trained in plant maintenance procedures maintain the plant.  A Management of Change system controls changes to equipment and procedures.",

This plan complies with the policy of providing a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors.  It extends to the design, training and implementation of a comprehensive emergency management program that saves lives and reduces property damage in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention is the primary goal.  However if an emergency should ever occur, the immediate goal is to contain the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries, mitigate the incident as quickly as possible and prevent any threat to the general public and neighbors.  It is Morgan's Point Complex policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policy and regulation that best serves the needs of the employees, community and the company.  Life preservation is the prime consideration, so all procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel.  Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions. \n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex produces numerous hydrocarbon product streams.  The primary product is methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE.  This material is produced as a motor fuel additive and serves to increase the oxygen content of the fuel so that cleaner combustion occurs.  MTBE is also used to raise the octane rating of the blended fuel.  \n\nOther products include propane/propylene mix, normal butane, isobutane, isobutane/isobutylene mix and \"natural\" gasoline.  Isobutylene is used in production of MTBE and is sold to other industrial facilities where it is used to produce synthetic lubricant products.  The complex is also involved in transshipment of commodity chemicals to other industr"

All of these components occur in sufficient quantities to be covered as flammables under RMP regulations.  Methanol and MTBE are not regulated under the RMP rules.  \n\nThe facility uses chlorine in the water treatment area and in a catalyst regeneration unit.  Separate one ton cylinders supply each need.  The chlorine distribution piping is operated under a vacuum to prevent chlorine from being released to the atmosphere.\n\nA worst case scenario is designed to be a theoretical exercise which calculates the potential impact on the community based upon extreme conditions prescribed by the EPA.  Weather conditions are assumed to be the least favorable possible, existing safety systems and procedures can not be considered, and trained emergency personnel are assumed to stand idly by.  These assumptions make the worst-case scenario highly unlikely. \n\nFlammable Worst Case scenario:\n\nChemical: Isobutane/Isobutylene Mixture\n\nAssumptions:\n\n?

By Corporate policy, we operate safely and with concern for the environment.  We take this responsibility seriously.  The facility is designed following recognized design practices and procedures.  Detailed operating procedures and training assure that the facility will be operated safely during normal and emergency situations.  A sophisticated control system monitors the operation of the plant and if necessary an emergency shut down system will accomplish a safe and orderly shut down.  The facility has conducted process hazard analyses to determine the risks that exist in our process and opportunities to reduce those risks.  Morgan's Point Complex uses modern maintenance practices, tools and systems to keep equipment operating reliably and detect repair needs in their early stages.  To improve equipment reliability, the facility conducts mechanical integrity inspections and failure analysis to determine the root cause of failures.

The emergency response team was immediately notified and suited up.  Workers stopped the loading and hosed down the tank with water.  The workers then removed the product from the rail car to a storage tank.  The rail car and surrounding area was continuously hosed down with water until the rail car had been emptied.  Forty barrels of Isobutane were released into the atmosphere but were knocked down by the water spray and could not be detected by monitoring equipment outside the facility.  One hundred and thirty-nine barrels of Isobutane were released to the flare and one hundred barrels of Isobutane were transferred to a storage tank.\n\n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response plan consists of four elements: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.  \n\nPrevention is supported by policies and procedures intended to assure the plant is operated in a safe manner.  Inspections and audits of practices assure that the policies and procedures are being followed.  Periodic reviews of the procedures and training serve to reinforce the importance of operating the plant in a safe manner.\n\nPreparedness includes development of emergency procedures, obtaining and installing emergency equipment and notification devices, development and training of a plant emergency response team, coordination with neighboring companies, local authorities and CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid).  The plant has a written Emergency Planning and Response Manual and a team trained to implement the plans contained in the manual.  The facility has a system of alarms, radios and telephones that can be used to communicate with employees neighboring facilities and local agencies.  Periodic drills are conducted for likely scenarios, and emergency pre-planning "

A review is conducted following each drill to assess the effectiveness of these preparations. \n\nResponse is conducted under the Incident Command System (ICS) as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120.  There are ICS trained personnel on site at all times.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and CIMA are the points of contact for offsite agencies.\n\nRecovery procedures include incident investigation, damage assessment, clean-up and restoration.  In addition, a review of the emergency response is conducted to evaluate and improve the response plans for the future.\n\n\nWe are constantly reviewing and revising existing procedures, developing new procedures, and researching methods to increase employee awareness.  \n\nMorgan's Point Complex has demonstrated a willingness to be involved with community programs, and to be a responsible good neighbor.  These practices are part of the management commitment."
