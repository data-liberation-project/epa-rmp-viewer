The facility was established in December 2000.  Today, the 120,000-square-foot facility receives, weighs, labels and distributes more than 30 percent of the company's retail products.  The property is surrounded by farmland, industrial facilities, schools and residential areas.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (R717), used as the refrigerant for the cooling system, is the only regulated substance covered by CFR Part 68 at PerdueA\u00bfs Prince George facility.  The total quantity of ammonia used is approximately 14,500 pounds, distributed throughout various systems components (compressor, pressure vessels, condensers, etc.) at the facility.  The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the refrigeration room, with the exception of the condensers, which are located on the roof; piping and evaporators are located throughout the facility.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.  All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.

The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security.  Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide variety of environmental, health and safety training to its staff.\r\n\r\n2. General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Perdue Farms Prince George facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Perdue Farms also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its system operating parameters and monitoring system daily with all observations logged on a checklist.\r\n\r\n3. Worst Case Release Scenarios:\r\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia refrigeration.  The scenario involves the release of 14,500 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\r\n\r\n4. Alternative Release Scenario:\r\nOne alternative release scenario has been considered.  Release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with duration of sixty (60) minutes.

Emergency Response Program:\r\nPerdue Farms has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations.  The facility has a trained emergency response team that will respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.  The written Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.  In addition, Perdue Farms training program includes annual refreshers.  Also, the plant will conduct a mock evacuation two (2) times per year with at least one drill coordinated with local emergency responders (LEPC/Fire/EMS).\r\n\r\n7. Risk Communication Plan:\r\nAs part of its Risk Management Program, Perdue Farms has developed an RMP Communications Plan.  The goals of the plan are (1) educate the public on the potential risk of regulated substances used by Perdue; (2) respond to any concerns that RMP discovers may cause with honest, fact-based communications; and (3) be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental chemical release scenario. Proactive materials about the disclosure information, accident and a process for announcing that an accident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared.  In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civic groups, the media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\r\n\r\n8.
