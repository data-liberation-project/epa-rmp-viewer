The facility is an independent wholesale distributor of ethanol and petroleum-based refined products.    Operation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered processes involves the use or handling of certain listed regulated substances as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 40 CFR Part 68.  Currently, the regulated substances at the site are butane, anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nButane is stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a maximum rated capacity of 126,360 pounds (lbs).  Butane is used as a seasonal blending component in gasoline.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a maximum rated capacity of 2,000 gallons (10,300 lbs).  An administrative control will be placed on the tank restricting it to an 80 percent fill (1,600 gallons or 8,240 lbs).\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide is stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a maximum rated capacity of 8,000 gallons (96,000 lbs).  An administrative control will be placed on the tank restricting it to a 60 percent fill (4,800 gallons or 55,152 lbs).\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates as measured by the front gate entrance are latitude 33.449350 and longitude -86.877961 decimal degrees; the facility coordinates as measured at the butane tank are latitude 33.451433 and longitude -86.875966; the facility coordinates as measured at the anhydrous ammonia tank are latitude 33.458434 and longitude -86.877097; and the facility coordinates as measured at the sulfur dioxide tank are latitude 33.458434 and longitude -86.877097.  \r\n\r\n1.2\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nThe facility accidental release prevention and response practices and programs are designed to protect the employees, contractors, visitors, the general public and the environment.

In the event of a release, emergency response procedures are in place to minimize any impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nA hazard assessment was performed to analyze releases for potential impacts to the surrounding community and environment.  These assessments consist of determining \"worst case\" and \"alternative case\" scenarios as specified by the EPA.

The Alternative Case Scenario (ACS) inputs are presented on Table 2 followed by supporting calculations.  Following is a description and summary of conclusions for the analysis.\r\n\r\n2.1\tWORST CASE SCENARIO (WCS) DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nPer the criteria described by EPA, a \"worst case\" scenario event was selected for:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tButane tank rupture - flammable gas\r\n\u00bf\tAnhydrous Ammonia (Ammonia) tank rupture - toxic gas\r\n\u00bf\tSulfur Dioxide tank rupture - toxic gas.\r\n \r\nAs previously mentioned administrative controls are in place for Ammonia (80% fill limit) and Sulfur Dioxide (60% fill limit).  Furthermore, the Ammonia and Sulfur Dioxide tanks have secondary containment (passive measures) for which no credit was taken into account to demonstrate the conservative nature of the calculations.   \r\nThe worst case scenarios selected are described below:\r\n\r\nFLAMMABLE WORST CASE SCENARIO:\r\n\r\nButane Release -\r\n\r\nThe"

The purpose is to elevate safety awareness of all employees through activities, organized meetings, review accident investigations, review inspection reports, safe work practices etc.  The end result desired is to achieve a reduction of risky behaviors associated with incidents and injuries both on and off the job.   Formal safety meetings are supplemented by \"toolbox talks\" of 10 to 15 minutes that are done at the start of a work shift or at other times designated by the supervisor.\r\n\r\nBBS Periodic Safety Field Visits are performed by salaried and hourly employees to provide informal forums for discussi"

Each step is analyzed to identify potential hazards that may cause an injury.  Safe work practices are then identified to prevent the potential injury identified while the work is performed.\r\n\r\nThe Injury and Illness Prevention Plan details how plant management and employees will reduce incident risk through a combination of proper work planning,  engineering controls, inspections, personal protection equipment (PPE) and promptly and thoroughly investigating accidents and near-miss situations to determine the root causes and to correct the problem in order to prevent recurrences.    \r\n \r\n3.2\tPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nAt Sunoco, many written documents are available which provide guidance on how to safely operate the various processes within the plant.

      "SummaryText": "3.3\tPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSES\r\n\r\nSunoco utilizes PHAs (as detailed in Injury & Illness Prevention Plan) to ensure that controls are in place to minimize, manage and control hazards that may potentially affect both on-site and off-site personnel and the environment. By reviewing hazards associated with anticipatable changes in the process, PHAs are designed to assist in identifying operability problems, safety issues and environmental concerns, and the associated causes, consequences, safeguards and risks.  In addition to performing PHAs that are triggered by changes, PHAs are also performed to revalidate unit PHAs at least every five years. \r\n\r\nThe primary style of PHA used within Sunoco for both initial and revalidation PHAs is the \"What if\" checklist technique.  However, Sunoco may use other techniques such as the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) when it is determined that a more detailed analysis is required by the change.  The PHA is conducted by a team of Sunoco employees and may be led by an outside consultant or a site employee.  At a minimum, the Sunoco team always consists of members representing maintenance and operations.  Other employees and contract personnel with specialized expertise may be called in to participate on an as needed basis.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and any environmental, safety, and operational concerns which may have a deleterious affect either on site or off site.  Depending on the likelihood of a hypothesized event or process change and the seriousness of the consequences, actions are formulated by the PHA team, which are presented to plant management to review and address as necessary.  Actions/recommendations are intended to improve process design, improve operability and improve safety.  \r\n\r\nPlant management will in turn assign each action to individuals with the experience and knowledge to address and close out each action.  Depending on the potential impact of the \r\n\r\nhazard identified, target"

These operating procedures have been developed to be consistent with process safety information, and are maintained as such through annual reviews by operating personnel.  For the butane tank system, the O&M Manual covers operating steps such as initial startup, normal operations and delivery, shutdowns, evacuation of the tank and emergency procedures.  For the anhydrous ammonia system, the supplier (Tanner Industries) provides a \"Customer Manual\" provides detailed information regarding physical/chemical properties, withdrawal, electrical connections, product withdrawal, piping systems, maintenance, leaks, inspections, and other operational information.  For sulfur dioxide, the O&M Manual covers operating steps such as initial start up, normal operation, delivery and emergency procedures for the sulfur dioxide tank, pump and vaporizing system.\r\n\r\nOther operations procedures also cover safety and health considerations along with specific procedures located at the unit.  Written procedures address all aspects listed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the RMP regulations.   \r\n\r\n3.5\tTRAINING\r\n\r\nSunoco has a comprehensive training program in place for employees involved in operating the plant.  This program is designed to address the needs of new employees and experienced operators.  The Injury and Illness Prevention Plan outlines specific training which includes but is not limited to PPE, job specific training, emergency response, chemical hazard information, lock-out/tag-out etc.  Sunoco utilizes both classroom and on the job training.
