ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES    (a)\nCorning Incorporated, Wilmington, North Carolina Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technology, procedures and management practices.  The prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68,  Prevention Program.\n1.1.1. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\n Corning has a management system in place that oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other Corning policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1.2. PREVENTION PROGRAM, LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\n Corning maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  These are maintained in Corning's Process Information Management System (PIMS) document control system.\n1.2. CORNING STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE WILMINGTON, NC SITE   (b)\nThe Corning Plant employs 1000 full-time employees engaged in the manufacture of glass fiber optics.  Chlorine is used as part of the manufacturing process.\n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\n The site is owned and operated by Corning Incorporated, Optical Fiber Division.  The site is located at 310 North College Road, Wilmington, New Hanover County, North Carolina.  The 60-acre site is bordered by North College Road on the west, and Martin Luther King Jr Parkway on the east and north.\n The Plant has a chlorine storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Cont"

REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n Chlorine is the only regulated substance on site that exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The chlorine process was installed as part of the process of manufacturing glass fiber optics.  The chlorine is received, stored and used in two processes that distribute it to four control panels. \n Chlorine is an EPA-and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe Corning accidental release prevention program is based on the OSHA PSM program and EPA RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the Hanover County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) through the City of Wilmington North Carolina Fire Department.\n1.3.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)(1)\n Facility-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  The overviews of these programs are listed below:\nA? Corning has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nA? The PIMS document control system is an integral part of the management of change for all operations on site.  \nA? Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphas awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used."

      "SummaryText": " \nA? Maintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \nA? Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure learning from each event as well as correcting the causes of the incident. \nA? Employees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \nA? Safe work practices used throughout the facility include:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out Tag Out Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical lines. \n A? Contractors must meet Corning's high safety and technical standards as part of selection and ongoing evaluations.  Also, Corning demands training of contractors specific to areas to be worked in. \n1.3.2. CHLORINE-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM  (d)(2)\n1.3.2.1. Chlorine-Specific Policies and Procedures\nChemical-specific prevention features of the facility include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine specific program.  These include:\nA? Specific procedures for the operation of the chlorine building. \nA? Completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to start up of the modified chlorine system. \nA? Specific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under emergency response. \nA? Specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine. \nA? Finally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the chlorine system. \n1.3.2.2. Facility Design\nThe facility and support equipment of the chlorine storage and control building meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The building is equipped with temperature control and vent make-up.  The building is under negative pressure created by the vent scrubber.  There are two modes of vent operations, normal and emergency.  In the event of a chlorine leak the vent system doubles the air turnover through the bu"

      "SummaryText": "ilding.\n1.4.2.3. Equipment Design\nThe chlorine piping system is made of Hastelloy metal tube.  This tube is both chlorine compatible (not corroded by chlorine) and rated to 1,500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine is only 150 psig giving a 10 to 1 safety factor.  There are two (2) chlorine monitors that detect the presence of chlorine in the storage building.  The monitors along with other detectors in the plant will alarm to alert employees of a potential chlorine leak.\n1.4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nCorning has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a).\n1.5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Corning Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response \"decision tree\" and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted on a specified frequency.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the City of Wilmington Fire Department, which is a member of Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including:  fire, medical, rescue, waste management, and police departments in New Hanover County. Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the Corning plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators, a primary response team, and a backup team.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \"B\" Kit is maintained on site to stop leaks.\n1.5.1. PERSONNEL (f)(1)\n Personnel are the key resource of Corning's prevention program. Employees make up the operators and emergency response teams.  Corning fosters a "

CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY  (g)\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the May, 2008 internal audit of the PSM program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and are being implemented as required.  \nCorning continually reviews implemented and potential safety improvements for all of its operations.\n"
