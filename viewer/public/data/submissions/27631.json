At General Chemical Delaware Valley Works, four listed chemicals are managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the USEPA\u00bfs program level 3 criteria.  No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to USEPA\u00bfs program level 3 criteria include Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Oleum, and Methyl Chloride.  Methyl Chloride is a component found in some forms of the spent acid received for regeneration at Delaware Valley Works.  Although General Chemical Delaware Valley Works is not currently receiving spent acid containing this component, General Chemical is filing a predictive RMP for future use of Methyl Chloride.
