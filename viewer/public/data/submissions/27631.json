At General Chemical Delaware Valley Works, four listed chemicals are managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the USEPA?s program level 3 criteria.  No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to USEPA?s program level 3 criteria include Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Oleum, and Methyl Chloride.  Methyl Chloride is a component found in some forms of the spent acid received for regeneration at Delaware Valley Works.  Although General Chemical Delaware Valley Works is not currently receiving spent acid containing this component, General Chemical is filing a predictive RMP for future use of Methyl Chloride.  As identified in this plan, Delaware Valley Works is in compliance with the requirements of USEPA?s 40 CFR Part 68 for management of Methyl Chloride, Anhydrous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, and Oleum.\n\n\n\nThis amended RMP describes Delaware Valley Work?s risk management program, which includes a hazard assessment, release prevention program and emergency response program. The hazard assessment includes one worst-case release scenario and four alternative case release scenarios. The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B (68.20-68.42), as well as the USEPA?s Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document. The release prevention and emergency response programs at Delaware Valley Works were developed based on requirements of the CAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Pro"

These products include sulfur-based chemicals, fluoborates, sulfuric acid, and other specialty products.  Delaware Valley Works occupies 130 acres on the lower Delaware River.  It is divided into North and South portions by Philadelphia Pike.  The North Plant, located in Pennsylvania, contains batch reactors used to make specialty chemicals products.  The South Plant, located in Delaware, houses the sulfuric acid plant and units for making photo salt products.  Supports facilities at the plant include warehouse space, product-packaging line, loading and unloading facilities for trucks, and railcars.  The plant also contains it own product testing laboratory, as well as research and development facilities.\n\n\n\nGeneral Chemical Delaware Valley Works has four  (4) listed chemicals that are managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria.  No chemicals are managed on-site under program 1 or program 2 criteria.  The chemicals managed according to program level 3 criteria include Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS Number: 007664-41-7), Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride (CAS Number: 007664-39-3), Oleum (CAS Number: 008014-95-7), and Methyl Chloride (CAS Number: 0074-87-3).  Methyl Chloride is a component found in some forms of the spent acid received for regenerated at Delaware Valley Works.  Although General Chemical Delaware Valley Works is not currently receiving spent acid containing this component, General Chemical is filing a predictive RMP for future use of Methyl Chloride.

The USEPA requires us to assume that all safety and release prevention systems fail, and the contents are released in 10 minutes.

Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Delaware Valley Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n\n\n* Process Safety Information ? Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n\n\n* Mechanical Integrity ? Maintenance of mechanical equipment is of prime importance to the overall operating performance of a facility.  Equipment must be in proper operating condition for the system to maintain peak performance.  A sudden and unexpected breakdown of equipment can cause problems throughout the facility.  These types of problems can be minimized when a proper maintenance program is set up and followed.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, Delaware Valley Works has developed its maintenance program.  Inspections and services are based on the recommendations of experienced engineers and operators, the maintenance guides of equipment manufacturers, and industry standards.
