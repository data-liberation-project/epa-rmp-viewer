Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable release of substances.  However if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control, and contain the release.  The Midland Gasoline Plant uses refrigeration and fractionation to separate natural gas liquids (NGL) into saleable Liquefied Petroleum Gases (e.g. Ethane, Propane & Butane) and Natural Gasoline (Pentanes Plus).  As a result of this operation, those EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.

This information includes material of construction of process equipment.  This information also includes material of construction, design pressure, design temperature, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\n\n\nOnce staffing is completed the Midland Gasoline Plant will have a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process will be systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant will primarily use the Haz-op methodology and What-if/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The Haz-op methodology and What-if/Checklist technique is recognized by OSHA and the EPA as an approved method for conducting PHAs.

These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  The team findings will be forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings will be documented and retained. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) initial startup of a new process, and (7) consequences of deviations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operation and are paired with senior operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operations demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including this means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their work place, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Midland Gasoline Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental release of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Midland Gasoline Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\nDaily Operator Inspection\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\nSpecialized Safety Features (cont?d.)\n\n\n\nProcess relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization\n\n\n\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n\n\nEmergency Shutdown System\n\n    \n\nCurbing or dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\nRedundant equipment \n\n \n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\nFire extinguishers\n\n\n\nTrained personnel (HAZWOPER, fire response)\n\n\n\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant has not yet commenced operations, therefore, we have had no incidents over the past 5 years.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in plant emergency drills to ensure system integrity and reinforce proper employee response. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant process.    The emergency response program changes are administered through the \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM HISTORY (cont?d.)\n\n\n\nManagement of Change process, which includes informing and/or training personnel affected by the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Midland Gasoline Plant is coordinated with Midland County Local Emergency Planning Committee (MEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community?s emergency response plan. The local responder for plant emergencies is the Midland Fire Department.  The Midland Gasoline Plant has around ?the-clock communications capability with appropriate MEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVEIMPROVEIMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Midland Gasoline Plant reso"
