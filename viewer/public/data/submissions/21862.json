      "SummaryText": "Farmers Grain and Supply Company of Ashland is an Agricultural business designed and operated to serve our customers with their fertilizer needs .  Our facility is designed and maintained in accordance with local, state and federal rules and regulations.  Worst Case scenario would release 79,000 pounds (1-18,000 gallon tank) with a distance to endpoint of 1.89 miles.  The estimated population in that radius would approximate nearly 700 people.  Our public receptors would include schools, residences, a hospital and a public park.  Our employees are trained on a rotational basis with each of those who work with Anhydrous Ammonia going at least once every three years.  The employees, also perform safety inspections at least twice per year on the main storage facility as well as the nurse tanks and hoses.  Farmers Grain and Supply of Ashland has not experienced an injury accident within the last 5 years.   In the event of an emergency, The Ashland Fire Department will be notified and they've agreed to be our first responder.   We've shared and discussed our Emergency Response Plan with the Fire Dept and they are aware of the dangers of the ammonia faciltiy."
