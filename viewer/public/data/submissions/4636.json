      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe purpose of this document is to develop a Risk Management Program (RMP) for Peachtree City Water and Sewerage Authority's (hereinafter 'Authority\" or \"PCWASA\") Rockaway wastewater treatment plant, in compliance with the requirements of Clean Air Act risk management regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 68.  The program includes a hazard assessment that evaluates both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  This document serves a vital community right to know function by informing the public of potential risks associated with the releases of chlorine and describes the Authority's efforts to minimize such risks. \n\nREGULATORY BACKGROUND\n\nSection 112(r) of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required certain facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.  The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provision,\" rules (contained in 40 CFR Part 68) to implement the 112(r) requirements.  Under this rule, all covered facilities must implement a risk management program and file a risk management plan with the EPA by June 21, 1999.  A covered facility would be one that uses, stores, manufactures, handles, or moves any of the 140 chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68 at quantities exceeding the threshold levels as provided in the regulations. \n\nFACILITY INFORMATION \n\nRockaway wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is a covered facility because of the usage and storage of chlorine.  Chlorine is a regulated substances with a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds under the regulations.  The chlorination facilities at the Rockaway WWTP consist of two 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (potential for a total storage quantity of 4,000 pounds of chlorine).  Since the storage quantity of chlorine  exceeds threshold, Rockaway WWTP is a covered facility under the Risk Manag"

      "SummaryText": "ement Plan rules.\n\nRockaway WWTP is a 2 million gallon per day (MGD) WWTP.  The WWTP provides sewage treatment to the local residential population and industries that are located in the city.  The WWTP is a biological activated sludge treatment system with sequencing batch reactor type aeration basins.  Sludge stabilization is not provided and the Authority disposes of the sludge by contract landfilling.  Effluent disposal is into Line Creek.  Prior to discharge, the treated effluent is disinfected using chlorine.  The RMP focuses on the chlorination facilities at the WWTP.\n\nBased on the quantities of chlorine stored at the the WWTP, it is very likely that there will be off-site consequences for public receptors in the event of a worst-case release, and therefore it will not qualify as a Program 1 facility.  Since Georgia is a federal OSHA state (i.e., Georgia has not been delegated OSHA responsibilities), state and local governments within Georgia are not subject to OSHA PSM standards, and therefore Rockaway WWTP will not be a Program 3 facility.  Thus, Rockaway WWTP will be classified as a Program 2 facility.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n \nThe off-site consequence analysis consists of two components: a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nWorst-case scenario has been defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an end point (DTE).   The DTE is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  In the case of Rockaway WWTP, the worst-case scenario would involve the sudden release of the contents of a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine.\n\nRMP Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (RMP guidance) was used to estimate the DTE associated with a worst-case release.  The calculations did not consider an"

The guidance assumes that the contents of a 1-ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) are completely released over a 10-minute period with a corresponding release rate of 200 lb/min.  The model assumes a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class F.  \n\nUsing this approach, it is predicted that a worst-case release of chlorine will result in a DTE of 3.0 miles, in a rural setting such as Rockaway WWTP, with an end point concentration of 0.0087 mg/L.  The worst-case release impacts 12,059 persons.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for a covered process is one that is more likely to occur than a worst-case scenario.  The RMP guidance suggests that the alternative release scenario should reach an endpoint off site, unless no such scenario exists.  Based on an evaluation of the processes and procedures at the Rockaway WWTP, it appears that a vapor release scenario is most likely. \n\nRMP guidance was used to estimate the DTE for a vapor release from a hole of = inch in diameter.  Calculations in the guidance assume a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability class D.  No active or passive mitigation systems were considered.  Such a release is estimated to impact 211 persons.  \n\nOff-site Public Receptors\n\nPublic receptors include off-site residences; institutions (e.g., schools and hospitals); industrial, commercial, and office buildings; and parks or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time without restriction by the stationary source where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations as a result of an accidental release. \n\nA worst case release of chlorine at Rockaway WWTP will impact southern portions of Peachtree City south of Lake Peachtree and a majority of City of Senoia.  An alternative release may impact the adjacent baseball and soccer complex. \n\nOff-site Environmental Receptors\n\nEnvironmental receptors include national or state parks"

Environmental receptors are not affected as a result of either a worst case release or an alternative release.\n\nLeak Detection Procedure\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided in the chlorine cylinder storage area.  These detectors have been set to detect leak at a level of 5 ppm.  Chlorine leaks can also be readily detected by smell even at low concentrations.  Chlorine gas connections under pressure should be periodically inspected for the following:\n\nDiscoloration of Joint:  If a leak is in progress, cadmium plating provided over bronze and brass fittings will disappear and the base metal will take on a reddish color.  Green copper chloride may also form around the leak area. \n\nMoisture Formation: Small droplets of water may appear on the underside of a leaking chlorine joint.  It is recommended that chlorine lines be painted in bright yellow so that brown rust holes will be readily visible.  \nAmmonia can be used to detect chlorine leaks.  If ammonia vapor is directed at a leak, a white cloud will form indicating the source of the leak.  A plastic squeeze bottle containing liquid commercial ammonia should be kept on site.  Leaks may also be detected by applying soap solution to suspected joints and observing for bubbles of escaping gas.  A trade product called \"Leak-Tec\" is also available for the detection of chlorine leaks and is preferred by some operations personnel.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nProgram Elements\n\nThe Authority has developed an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  \n\nCoordinating Agencies\n\nThe emergency response plan will be coordinated annually with the Peachtree City and Fayette County police and fire departments and the Fayette County Civil Defense which is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

The local coordinating agencies have been provided with a copy of the report, and agreements have been reached with local emergency response agencies.\n\nResponse Procedures\n\nResponse procedures are dictated by the magnitude of the release.  For planning purposes three magnitudes of release are considered:\n\nSmall Release:\n\nSmall leak such as from a rust hole, faulty valve, leaking gasket, packing nut leak, etc.\nLeak containable within the building area.\nFacility-wide evacuation not needed.\nLeak can be controlled and managed by plant personnel without outside help.\n\nMedium Release:\n\nA medium leak such as from a broken valve housing or blown pressure gauge, etc.\nLeak containable within facility boundaries.\nRequires evacuation of entire facility.\nLeak controllable by plant personnel, but may require outside assistance, traffic control, and limited evacuation.\n\nLarge Release:\n\nA large leak such as from a ruptured cylinder.\nRelease extends beyond facility boundaries.\nRequires facility and community evacuation and in-place sheltering.\nWill require the assistance of fire, police, ambulance, hospital, and other local emergency services.\n\nResponse Actions for Small Release Scenario\n\nAs soon as a chlorine gas leak is detected, the employee who notices the leak must notify the plant operator and emergency coordinator of the leak.  If the employee is trained in controlling chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks, and the leak is minor and appears controllable, he or she should act immediately to rectify the situation.  In no event must the employee act in a manner that will endanger his or her safety.  If the leak appears serious enough that one person cannot control the situation, the employee must not act alone.  The employee must summon help and in the meantime gather the tools/equipment needed to control the leak.  After the plant operator or emergency coordinator arrives on the scene, the employees must "

Regulatory agencies may have to be notified in the event of a small leak.  \n\nResponse Actions for Medium Release Scenario\n\nA determination that a release is medium rather than small is a judgment call made by the employee detecting the leak based on a visual evaluation of the situation.  The employee who noticed the leak should immediately notify the plant operator and emergency coordinator of the leak and alert them that the release appears to be medium. If the employee is trained in the control of gas leaks he or she must wear a SCBA and wait upwind of the source for the plant operator and emergency coordinator to arrive at the scene.  The plant operator must evacuate the facility of all employees except those who will participate in leak control efforts.  The plant operator must also immediately alert the local emergency response agencies that their assistance may be needed in the areas of community evacuation and medical help, if the leak gets worse.  After arriving at the scene, the plant operator and the emergency coordinator must wear SCBA units and begin leak control efforts. Control of the leak should be the first priority for the employees. Authorities at PCWASA including the General Managerwill be notified of the release.  Regulatory agencies will be notified following the discussion with the Authority personnel.  \n\nResponse Actions for Large Release Scenario\n\nResponse actions for a large release are similar to a medium-scale release.  However, in this scenario, the accident is so major (such as a ruptured cylinder) that the bulk of the response efforts are tailored toward post-release mitigation, community evacuation and medical assistance.  Community evacuation if required should be conducted with the assistance of the local police and fire departments.  Any residents living in the zone of influence should be temporarily evacuated to an area of safety until su"
