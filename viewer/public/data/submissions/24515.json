To this end, our strategy for managing emergencies is to incorporate emergency response actions into all of our process operating procedures, procure necessary personal protective and emergency response equipment, initiate Incident Command Systems and thoroughly educate and train all of our operating personnel in appropriate actions to minimize the effects from an accidental chemical release.  Our contingency capabilities are tested at least four times per year to help ensure the operational readiness of our personnel to respond to plant emergencies.\n \n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nTOXIC:     Sulfur Dioxide.
