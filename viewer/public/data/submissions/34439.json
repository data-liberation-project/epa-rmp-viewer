      "SummaryText": "\nEast Penn Manufacturing Company, Inc. is a producer of lead storage batteries with all storage battery manufacturing facilities located at Lyon Station, Pennsylvania.  East Penn provides jobs for over 4000 employees and is one of the regions largest employers.  In conjunction with lead storage battery manufacture at the Lyon Station, PA site, East Penn owns and operates a secondary lead smelter for the purpose of reclaiming lead and other materials from spent batteries.  East Penn recycles nearly 100% of materials from used, spent lead-acid batteries.  The smelter utilizes an ammonia scrubber to remove Sulfur Dioxide from the process gas streams of both the reverbatory and blast furnaces and maintains onsite a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank and piped delivery system to the scrubber headers.   The ammonia scrubber and ammonia tank and piping was designed and built according to generally accepted good engineering practices in accordance with the requirements of the ASME code for pressure vessels and 29 CFR 1910.111 - Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nAs stated in our written EHS policy, East Penn is committed to complying with all applicable government regulations and producing batteries in a way that does not jeopardize the health and safety of employees, community and the environment.  This includes taking reasonable precautions and establishing systems to ensure that a release of anhydrous ammonia at hazardous concentrations does not occur.  East Penn is also committed to the maintenance of an onsite,  trained and capable emergency response team and hazardous materials team to minimize the severity and duration of a release, should one occur and to work closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Berks County Response Team to minimize offsite impacts.   \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Release Prevention Program has been established and implemented according to the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.119 and consists of the fol"

Rules for contractors, maintenance activities and hot work permits exist, however, there is minimal contractor involvement in this operation.\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no releases meeting the criteria outlined in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nEast Penn's Hazardous Materials Team is trained to the Operations Level.  Arrangements have also been made with the local (Berks County) Hazardous Materials Response Team to respond to leaks if conditions dictate or the release has the potential to have offsite consequences.  Members of East Penn's Hazardous Materials Team have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  \n\nPLANNED SAFETY CHANGES\nAll changes determined to be necessary from the last compliance audit (10/01/2001) have been completed.  Future changes, which are expected to be underway in June and July 2004 include thickness testing of tank walls, replacement of pressure relief valves, and replacement of highflow valves."
