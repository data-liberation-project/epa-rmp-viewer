This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process equipment at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe Camino Real Foods' management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Camino Real Foods' safety and environmental policies are administered by the CFO/VP of Operations, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Camino Real Foods facility is located at 2638 East Vernon Avenue in Vernon, California, which is located approximately 1.75 miles south of Interstate 10 and 1.75 miles west of Interstate 710. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility began operations in 1981, expanded in 2009, and expanded again in 2012-13.\n\n\n\nThe primary business of Camino Real Foods is to manufacture frozen Mexican food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility uses approximately 11,493 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance, as a refrigerant within three separate closed systems (Main Refrigeration, Mechanical Freezer System 1-3, and Mechanical Freezer System 4).  There are 2,300 pounds of ammonia in the Main Refrigeration System, 5,693 pounds of ammonia in the Mechanical Freezer System 1-3, and 3,500 pounds of ammonia in the Mechanical Freezer System 4.  The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then ba"

Typical operating conditions of the Main Refrigeration range from 0 psig on the low side to 175 psig on the high side of the system.  Typical operating conditions of the Mechanical Freezer System 1-3 range from 10\" Hg on the low side to 170 psig on the high side.  Typical operating conditions of the Mechanical Freezer System 4 are 1.7 psig on the low side to 166 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration systems, the facility complies with CalEMA's California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management Program, and EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nCamino Real Foods' ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, Camino Real Foods operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration systems have been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated saf"

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the PHA (November 19, 2012) revealed that there have been no ammonia releases over the past five years (November 2007 to November 2012) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \n\n\n\nCamino Real Foods personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Camino Real Foods CFO/VP of Operations.  The CFO/VP of Operations will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Review performed on August 26, 2008, Hazard Review Addendum performed on August 20, 2009, and Process Hazard Analysis Addendum performed on November 19, 201"
