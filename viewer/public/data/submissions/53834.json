The TTSI terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.    The terminal is located at 230 Dunphy Road, Battle Mountain, NV.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nMHF-LS is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is MHF-LS policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nMHF-LS will handle liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) products at this terminal, transloading product from railroad tank cars into highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, MHF-LS has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for LPG products using the parameters specified by the EPA.  MHF-LS\u00bfs worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, MHF-LS has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nMHF-LS also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level"

After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, MHF-LS has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by MHF-LS is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, MHF-LS considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA\u00bfs RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of LPG products, MHF-LS has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n\u00bf\tMHF-LS has developed standard operating procedures (SOP\u00bfS) for the Transloading of LPG products from railcar to highway cargo tank for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n\u00bf\tMHF-LS encourages all employees contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.  Employees are expected to follow established procedures until employee driven process changes are implemented, training conducted and communicated to all affected persons.\n\u00bf\tMHF-LS conducts operational audits and inspections to insure compliance with established operating procedures, maintenance of transfer equipment and facility physical systems.\n\u00bf\tA documented inspection and maintenance program for the transfer unit, railcars and cargo tanks used for this operation is in place and will be maintained for the life of this operation.

In addition, the following agencies inspect the MHF-LS terminal on a regular basis:\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation- Federal Railroad Administration- Hazardous Materials Inspectors.  \n\nFive- Year Accident History\n\nMHF-LS has not handled LPG at this facility on a routine basis during the past five years.  There are no accidents or releases to report.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMHF-LS and the contract operator have documented emergency response plans and procedures in place at this facility to respond to and safety mitigates any release or accident involving LPG products.  Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by MHF-LS contract operators to control the release, if possible, and to make initial notification to local responders and to MHF-LS headquarters.\n\nOperator personnel at the terminal classified as Specialist Employees as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120 Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.
