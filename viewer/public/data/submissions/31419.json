The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAmerican Pacific Corporation Utah Operations (AMPAC) is dedicated to preventing chemical emergencies.  AMPAC has several divisions in its Utah operations.  The divisions are contiguously located on AMPAC property.  The facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by EPA.  AMPAC's WECCO division manufactures oxidizers and AMPAC's American Azide division manufactures sodium azide.  Anhydrous ammonia is an essential ingredient in ammonium perchlorate.  Anhydrous ammonia is a key ingredient in sodium azide.  Ammonium perchlorate is a critical component for the defense of our country and is an important ingredient in space program for both manned and unmanned vehicles.  Sodium azide is an agent in some air bags that supplies the nitrogen to inflate the air bags and save lives.  Ammonia is a toxic substance that is widely used in households in limited concentrations.  The use of Ammonia requires us to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our coworkers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  At AMPAC, it is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices designed into the systems.  Our procedures for handling the materials and the training that we have provided to our employees reduce the possibility of an accident.  AMPAC administratively limits the fill ratio of the ammonia tanks to 80% in the perchlorate process, the fill ratio of ammonia tanks in the sodium amide process to 85% all in accordance with good safety practices for the vessels.  AMPAC Senior management has devoted many resources to training our employees to be capable of responding to any situations that could be hazardous and believes the response training is also int"

AMPAC has also provided training to local and state responders to increase their familiarity with our materials and increase public safety in the event that an emergency occurs with any of the products we produce even if they were manufactured by a competitor.  The AMPAC facility was intentionally constructed away from town to minimize any effects if an incident did occur.  AMPAC believes the public recognizes its commitment to be a good citizen of the community based on its community involvement and its care in the design and operation of the plant to protect the community.\n\n2. The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\nPropane is no longer included in this report.\n\nAMPAC has one EPA Risk Management Plan regulated substances on site.  It is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAMPAC has two anhydrous ammonia tanks at the WECCO division, which can contain 82,400 pounds of ammonia each.  Ammonia can be received by truck but is normally received by rail.  A rail car may contain up to 180,000 pounds of ammonia.  The ammonia is used in three ammonium chloride reactors.  Ammonia is transported via pipeline within the facility.\n\nAMPAC has two anhydrous ammonia tanks at the American Azide division, which can contain 131,402 pounds of ammonia each.  Ammonia can be received by truck but is normally received by rail.  A rail car may contain up to 180,000 pounds of ammonia.  The ammonia is used in sodium amide reactors.  Ammonia is transported via pipeline within the facility.\n\n3. Facility description, Worst Case Release Scenarios, and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\nAMPAC has prepared two worst-case and alternate release scenarios for ammonia but will not include it in the executive summary due to national security reasons and EPA's suggestion.  \n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "steps:\n\nAMPAC is regulated under OSHA's PSM standard for ammonia and EPA's regulations on risk management programs, which requires a 14 point program be present to prevent accidents.  AMPAC has a maintenance program that generates preventive maintenance work orders routinely through a computer program.  AMPAC's operators and mechanics are well trained.  AMPAC has written operating procedures which meet ISO 9001 requirements for a quality system and are audited by outside auditors on a regular schedule.  These items all serve to minimize the risk of an accidental release.  AMPAC has additionally trained its response team so that a well trained team is present 24 hours per day, 7 days a week to respond to any emergency in a timely and appropriate fashion.  The emergency response program specifically covers ammonia as well as other materials on site not regulated by EPA under the risk management program.  Changes in the way the new Landview program captures data is the reason our exposure population was reduced to under four.\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\nAMPAC has had no releases of ammonia that threatened on site or off site personnel.  No injuries have occurred from this material.  No evacuations have occurred as a result of this material and no property damage has occurred as a result of ammonia.  AMPAC does have an incident investigation program.  AMPAC does take corrective actions even for minor incidents that do not trigger recording under this program.  AMPAC continues to develop its safety programs through both new technologies and learning from any experiences no matter how minor.\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nAs previously mentioned, AMPAC has a well-trained emergency response organization.  AMPAC has written response procedures on which the team has been trained and the procedures are provided to the Iron County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for coordination.  The response team has periodic drills, which vary from responding to fire"

AMPAC has served as the site for community drill involving a simulated acid spill in the past and will make itself available for any reasonable requests by the LEPC for future drills.  AMPAC has had a clear history of immediately notifying outside responders in the past (these responses have involved items not regulated under the risk management regulations).  AMPAC has worked side by side with outside responders to provide any information that they may require in preparing their responses to any AMPAC incident.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAMPAC has added new valves that are remotely controlled and that act to create a shutdown if excessive temperatures occur at the ammonia tanks.  The valves were installed July 6, 2001 and were identified during an April 1999 audit as candidates for improvement.  Maintenance will occur to check the relief valves once a month.  These valves are on a 5 year replacement schedule.  They are scheduled to be changed June 2005."
