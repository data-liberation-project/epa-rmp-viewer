      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana Hydrogen/Ammonia Facility\nLouisiana LDEQ Facility Identification Number 2062\n\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous and liquid hydrogen.  Natural gas and steam are used in the manufacturing process to produce hydrogen. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in processing part of the gaseous hydrogen stream and also to liquefy carbon dioxide at the facility.  Ammonia and the flammable mixture used to produce hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility manufactures liquid and gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen is used by our customers in their manufacturing processes. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstoc"

      "SummaryText": "k. The feedstock is mixed with steam and sent to the reformer furnace. In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst to approximately 1,500 degrees F, where a chemical reaction takes place that converts the mixture into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are than separated from the hydrogen. The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to our customers via pipeline or sent to a liquefier where the gas is cooled and stored as a liquid for delivery to our customers via tank truck and barges. \n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is used to cool part of the gaseous hydrogen stream to control the dewpoint and in the production of liquid carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide is a by product of the hydrogen production process). \n\nPure liquid hydrogen is stored in two 570,000 gallon spheres and in a 9,000 gallon storage tank.  Liquid hydrogen tanker trucks are loaded from the 570,000 gallon spheres or directly from the production stream for delivery to our customers. The 9,000 gallon tank is connected to a pump where the liquid is pumped to a high pressure and vaporized for filling gaseous hydrogen tube trailers for delivery to our customers.\n\nThe regulated processes at this facility are the ammonia storage with the associated refrigeration system, and the liquid hydrogen storage and associated flammable mixture used in the manufacture of hydrogen. The maximum amount of ammonia at this facility is 140,000 pounds. The maximum amount of hydrogen and hydrogen-containing mixtures at this facility is 750,000 pounds.\n\n 3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe toxic \"worst-case scenario\" (WCS), as defined by the EPA, is a catastrophic failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank releasing all 47,000 pounds over a ten minute period. The maximum dista"

Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe toxic \"alternative case scenario\" (ACS) is a break in, or sudden uncoupling of, the transfer hose from an ammonia tank truck while filling the storage tank.  Liquid ammonia is assumed to flow from the hose at a rate of 1,250 lbs/min for 2 minutes.  The ammonia vaporizes to form a cloud which reaches receptors offsite.  The EPA-defined endpoint is 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) for this event.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ACS. \n\nThe flammables \"worst-case scenario\" (WCS), as defined by the EPA, is a catastrophic failure of one of the liquid hydrogen storage spheres, releasing all 570,000 gallons (330,000 pounds) of liquid hydrogen which is assumed to form a vapor cloud and ignite resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for this WCS reaches receptors offsite.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe flammables \"alternative case scenario\" (ACS) for flammable substance at this facility is a flash fire resulting from crack in the natural gas pipeline that supplies feedstock to the reformer. The inventory of the pipe and connecting vessels of 21,000 pounds is assumed to be released. The maximum distance to the EPA defined flammable endpoint of 100% LFL (Low Flammability Limit) for this ACS reaches receptors off-site. \n\n\n4.

Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of flammable gas or ammonia that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n \n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs Specialist or Technician Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the  New Orleans Fire Department and its Hazmat Team for fires related to the flammable and or toxic processes.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
