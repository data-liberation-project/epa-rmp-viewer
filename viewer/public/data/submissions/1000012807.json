Policies and procedures are in-place to assist the staff with compliance with applicable hazardous materials rules and regulations. The Process Safety Management (PSM) Team at the facility is responsible to ensure appropriate procedures and safety measures are in-place to protect our employees and the surrounding community. The PSM Team is comprised of the Distribution Center Director, Maintenance Manager, Safety Manager with assistance from the Senior Director Facility Services Engineer, Corporate Environmental Manager and from the outside refrigeration contractor.\n\n    The facility is located in a commercial/residential area in the northeast part of the City of Lima. The facility consists of a warehouse house/distribution center and a truck maintenance facility. The main warehousing facility is approximately 370,000 square feet and the property is approximately 90 acres in size.  The area around the facility consists of some commercial businesses and residential properties. The terrain is mostly flat and is characterized by paved areas of asphalt and concrete around the facility. The area southwest of the site is comprised of residential properties. The remaining neighbors are commercial/industrial type businesses.  The site has a storm water retention pond on the northern part of the property that serves as a source of water to the facility fire prevention system. The Ottawa River is located approximately one mile south of the facility.\n    \n    Nash Finch Lima receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to Nash Finch and independent grocery stores in the Lima area, northern and central Ohio as well as nearby states. Grocery products include dry goods, frozen products as well as meat and other perishable items. The facility has a truck shop and fuel islan"

The facility is connected to city water and sewer services.\n    \n    Hours of operation are up to 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Personnel at the facility include a distribution center director plus administrative staff, warehouse staff and truck drivers. Headcount at the facility is approximately 350 associates (warehouse staff and drivers).\n\nPart of the facility is a cold storage warehouse for the storage of frozen and perishable food products. The refrigeration for this part of the facility is provided by an ammonia and halocarbon refrigeration systems. The expanded ammonia system contains approximately 12,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. In this system, ammonia is the heat transfer medium that is compressed, cooled through the use of evaporative condensers and distributed to cooling evaporators throughout the ammonia refrigerated parts of the facility to maintain appropriate temperatures for the products stored in each area.\n\nBecause of the use of hazardous materials on-site, the facility is regulated by federal and state hazardous material rules and regulations. The ammonia, diesel fuel and sulfuric acid (used in powered industrial truck batteries) are regulated under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. The above ground use of petroleum products is regulated under Oil Pollution Prevention requirements (40 CFR Part 112) and as a result, the facility has a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nFrom an occupational safety and health perspective the facility is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard covering the management and use of the anhydrous ammonia on-site and is required to have an emergency response plan. Other OSHA rules such as lockout tagout, fal"

Safe guards in the form of computer control systems employing sensors and interlocks to shutdown the system in the event of an equipment malfunction or release of ammonia are built into the system. Alarm sensors are placed within the ammonia engine room (processing center) and throughout the facility to alert plant staff of any ammonia releases within the facility. Detailed emergency plans and procedures are in-place to warn our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a release. \n\nAs of the date of this RMP Plan update, there have been no significant ammonia releases from the facility since Nash Finch acquired the operation in 2005. Incident investigation procedures are in-place to ensure any future release is thoroughly investigated to determine the A?root causeA? of the incident and to ensure appropriate corrective action is implemented quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe facility has a detailed emergency response program to handle fire, ammonia releases or natural disasters. All employees receive training during new hire orientation sessions and periodic refresher training to ensure they understand the facility emergency response procedures. Attachments to Part 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan provide detailed coverage of potential ammonia release scenarios and the appropriate actions in response to those scenarios. In the event of an ammonia release, the employees are provided information over the facility public address system as to the nature of the release and instructions where they should assemble. Given the safety hazards of ammonia, the safest place maybe within the facility; if evacuation is necessary, the employees are given directions to the appropriate outdoor assembly point based on the direction of the wind.

The fire department periodically visits the facility to ensure they are familiar with the physical structure and the hazards related to the chemicals used on-site.\n\n"
