      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAllied Merchandising Industry is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Under no circumstances will our personnel remain in a hazardous atmosphere beyond the acceptable limits of their safety equipment. For emergency situations, we have coordinated with the Riverside County LEPC which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Allied Merchandising Industry facility located in Corona, CA is a warehouse that stores consumer products.  Included in these consumer products are BIC lighters and aerosol cans.  The quantity of BIC lighters and aerosol cans exceed the 10,000-pound threshold for flammable gases, namely isobutane, butane, and propane.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA Aloha as well as the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance\". The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Plan that is located on site.\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part \u00a768 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR \u00a71910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAllied Merchandising Industry maintains a detaile"

The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Allied Merchandising Industry maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, startup after an emergency shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nAllied Merchandising Industry has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAllied Merchandising Industry carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors. Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices. Training is provided to the personnel as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Allied Merchandising Industry to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and proced"

Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in the established process are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nAllied Merchandising Industry conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAllied Merchandising Industry promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAllied Merchandising Industry truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Allied Merchandising Industry has a strict policy of inf"

Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nAllied Merchandising Industry has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response\nAllied Merchandising Industry has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of an emergency action plan, including evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. Our emergency action plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Riverside County LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."
