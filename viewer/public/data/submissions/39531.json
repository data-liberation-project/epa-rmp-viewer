      "SummaryText": "Consumers Service Co. Inc. receives, stores and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia at the facility located at 150 North Blaine Avenue East of Hastings.  The maximum storage quanity of Anhydrous is 140,196 lbs.  The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - A maximum of 140,196 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 14,020 lbs/min into the rural area surrounding the plant up to 1.10 miles endpoint.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  This scenario has the potential to release 11,908 lbs of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 5,954 lbs/min in the rural area effecting the population within 4/10 of a mile.  The owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the community and the environment.  The facility has had no such release in the past 5 years.  Complying with safety standards for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and completing regular mainenance on the equipment at the facility will continue to prevent any accidental releases at the Consumers Service Co. Inc. Plant."
