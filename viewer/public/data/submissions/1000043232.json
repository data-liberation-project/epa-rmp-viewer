Simplot Company, Don Plant, Don Siding, Idaho, is committed to being a responsible community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and ongoing. Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a significant accidental release to the air from the plant. The Chubbuck Fire Department and local emergency agencies receive the annual Sara Title III reports on materials manufactured, stored, and handled at the Don Plant.  It is Simplot's policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory agencies.\r\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances manufactured, processed, stored, or handled:\r\n   1) The J.R. Simplot Company, Don Plant facility manufactures fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and animal feed supplements. The Don Plant unloads, stores, and handles anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the threshold limits requiring a RMP.\r\nc)  The general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n   1) Employees are trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials in the Plant. Each employee receives initial training, and refresher training every three years for PSM areas in the plant, or appropriate refresher training related to the job when hired or when re-assigned. Anhydrous ammonia is used and stored in several locations in the plant and employees assigned to these areas are trained to understand the hazards involved and to handle them safely.\r\n   2) In addition to training, the following precautions are taken:\r\n         A)  Pipes and equipment handling anhydrous ammonia have pressure relief valves.\r\n         B) Vehicle access is restricted by permit o"

The following elements of Process Safety Management decrease the likelihood of a release:\r\n   (1) Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\r\n   (2) Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be affected.\r\n   (3) Process Hazard Analyses are performed on all new processes or process units, and every five years on existing processes or process units that contain ammonia.\r\n   (4) Management of Change reviews are performed to prevent failure due to improper engineering of modifications.\r\n   (5) Operating Procedures are in place and operators are trained on these procedures.\r\n   (6) Incident Investigations are conducted on any accident or near miss to find possible changes that can be made to prevent future incidents.\r\n   (7) Emergency Response and Planning helps to mitigate the results of releases.\r\n   (8) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are conducted on all new or modified processes to assure proper construction.\r\nd) The five-year accident history\r\n    1) The Don Plant has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia with offsite consequences within the last five years.\r\ne)   The Emergency Response Program:\r\n    1) The Simplot Tactical Area Response Team (STAR Team) is a Simplot emergency response team comprised of trained employees. These employees are trained to respond to fires (in their incipient stages), chemical, medical and evacuation/rescue emergencies at the Don Plant. \r\n    2) In-plant emergency response is governed by the OSHA PSM Emergency Response Plan. The plan includes instructions to employees on incident command and employee evacuation, and requires regular evacuation drills.\r\n    3) Emergency Procedures for Spills and Releases of Hazardous Materials covers spills/releases of hazardous materials at t"

The plan contains the following elements:\r\n          A) Introduction\r\n          B) Reporting Procedures and Incident Identification\r\n          C) Spill Containment and Cleanup\r\n          D) Don Plant Emergency Response Training\r\n          E) Training Plan\r\n    4) The Don Plant is situated in Power County, Idaho. The Chubbuck City Volunteer Fire Department will respond to a fire emergency at the plant. The Pocatello Fire Department is the designated backup for Chubbuck. The Regional Response HAZMAT Team No. 5 is a division of the Pocatello Fire Department and is a support unit for the State of Idaho Emergency Response Commission. Power County Sheriff's Department has a mutual-aid agreement with the Bannock County Sheriff's Department. The Idaho State Police would respond to any incident involving the state highways near the plant, Highway 30 and I-86.\r\nf)   Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n    1) The Don Plant is continually evaluating the safety of workers and has been involved in behavioral safety, referred to as C.A.R.E. (Commit, Assess, Resolve, Encourage), which was established in 2007 as a behavioral based safety assessment program. The program is currently utilized by all salaried employees.   \r\n     2) All Don Plant employees have been trained in basic computer skills. This allows them to be able to reference all plant safety procedures and policies to ensure that they are understood and used on a daily basis.  All jobs at our facility have been reviewed and JSAs (Job Safety Analysis) have been written.  These documents covering RMP are reviewed and recertified annually. \r\n    3) Internal assessments are conducted to evaluate all PSM programs and make corrections and improvements as necessary. \r\n    4) Safety training is an ongoing process and is presented in three tiers. Each employee receives some or all of the tiered training, depending on his/her job classification. The training"
