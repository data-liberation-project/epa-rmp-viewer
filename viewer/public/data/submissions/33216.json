In 1994 we built a new manufacturing facility in Kay County Oklahoma. We built this plant according to all Federal, state and Local requirements and with strict compliance to NFPA #58 and #70 specifications. We are committed to our employees, the public and the environment to operate our facility in a safe manner.\n\n1. When we designed our Oklahoma plant all of the requirements of NFPA #58 to control an accidental release were built into it. We have always strived to keep up with the changing regulations for the product that we handle and also any new safety devices that help insure that we do not have a chemnical release.\n\n2. Technical Propellants, Inc. takes a very responsible attitude toward safety. Proper emergency planning and response are important elements of any safety and health program to help minimize employee exposure and injury. We have an emergency response policy in effect at this facility with a copy on file with Emergency Management of Ponca City. To comply with RMP regulations we have updated them to include written instructions to alert our employees, the Emergency Management of Ponca City and required responders in case of an emergency. We have also included safe distances, places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures.\n\n3. Technical Propellants, Inc. of Ponca City is located in Kay County Oklahoma. The office building is located 650 feet off the road. The tank farm consists of 7 steel ASME pressure tanks that contain our products and is located Southeast of the office building. We are a manufacturer of aerosol propellants. We receive raw LPG:ie-Propane-Isobutane and Butane into our plant by tank trucks. We process these products through molecular sieves that take out the impurities in the gas. It is then stored in tanks for shipment. Per our customers specifications we load these products by themselve"

We have always, and will continue to keep up with any new and improved measures that will help us maintain the highest standards possible for safety.\n\n5. We have not had any accidental release at our facility in the past 5 years.\n\n6. Our emergency response program is coordinated with the Emergency Management of Ponca City, the Ponca City Fire Department and the Kay County Sheriff's Department. Our personnel are trained to react to any emergency situation that may develop in the handling of our products. Should there be any accidental release we have a program in place to alert all emergency responders and the public.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety at our plant will include the updating of any new or improved safety and mitigation devices required by NFPA #58 which governs our facility. We will also update the training of our employees to incorporate any new safety devices that may become mandatory to insure their safety awareness."
