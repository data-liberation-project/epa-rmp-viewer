Chlorine is one of the major products made at this facility.  The daily production of the liquid chlorine is collected in seven (7) 650-ton chlorine storage tanks.  Chlorine from these tanks can be shipped to area customers via pipeline and from 55-ton and 90-ton rail cars.  A 250-ton tank and a 650-ton storage tank are operated in an empty and under a vacuum condition at all times to allow chlorine to be emptied from one of the seven storage tanks or pipelines in the event of an emergency condition.  The facility complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations in the loading and shipment of the Chlorine product.  Chlorine Institute-recommended practices are followed in the design, operation, and maintenance of this facility.  Vinyl chloride railcars are temporarily stored at the facility's rail yard.  As the railcars are disconnected from the motive force, they are subject to the RMP rule.\n\nThe process units containing ammonia and chlorine are inter-connected by piping and, therefore, are considered one process.  The Marshalling Yard area containing chlorine and vinyl chloride railcars are co-located with the chlorine process unit.  Therefore, this area is also considered part of the same Battleground Chlor-Alkali process.  Based on the RMP criteria for process program levels, this is considered a Program 3 process.\n\n3.

OxyVinyls does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in place to prevent such a scenario.  The alternative release scenarios that have been developed are based on more likely potential accidental releases.  These have been shared with the LEPC to assist them in improving the community emergency response plan.  \n\nDistances to toxic and flammable endpoints were calculated based on the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview.
