      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIowa Falls Ethanol Plant, LLC\n\nIowa Falls ethanol Plant, LC. is a newly constructed facility.  Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nIowa Falls Ethanol Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nIowa Falls Ethanol Plant's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant is located in Iowa Falls, Hardin County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.6 miles.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 97,200 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor "

      "SummaryText": "cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.   The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 560,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within the 0.6 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required.  The ARS is the release of 42,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.1 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within the 0.1 mile radius.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIowa Falls Ethanol Plant has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Iowa Falls Ethanol Plant's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and review of the facility's emergency re"
