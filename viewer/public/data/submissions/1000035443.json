The extruded product is in sheet form. This sheet is converted into various products.\n\n\n\n    Difluoroethane and Isopentane are delivered to R L Adams Plastics via tanker truck. The driver has to sign in and be approved for delivery. The Difluoroethane and Isopentane are unloaded using a truck mounted pump to the aboveground tank with maximum quantity of 45,000 lbs. and 56000 lbs. (respectively) in a secured tank farm using a vapor recovery system that prevents the release of vapors. The truck is bonded to the earth ground to prevent sparks. The driver must be qualified and trained in the safe handling of this product. The driver must be with the truck continuously throughout the unloading procedure. \n\n\n\n    1.     R.L. Adams Plastics Inc. works closely with the City of Wyoming Fire Department for the process information and updates of changes. The Wyoming Fire Department is our first responder.\n\n\n\n    2.     R.L. Adams Plastics Inc. insures the safe handling of Difluoroethane and Isopentane using various procedures. (Including but not limited to)\n\n    \n\n        A. Training for the safe practices of Difluoroethane and Isopentane, this includes all new employees, also annual reviews with all employees, and updates on a continuing basis.\n\n  \n\n        B. The use of monitoring equipment to ensure that safe levels of Difluoroethane and Isopentane are maintained. The use of FID ?flame ionized detectors? hand held monitor for actual PPM testing. Permanent mounted gas detection system that monitors the PPM and automatically calls from emergency telephone call list at specific alarm levels. The use of hand held gas detectors at the beginning "

The Difluoroethane would vaporize at a rate of 1380 lbs in ten minutes. It is assumed that an ignition source would ignite this vapor cloud causing an explosion.

The Worse case scenario was calculated using RMP Comp\n\n        The largest release of Isopentane possible would be the total contents of the 56,000 lbs. in the tank that would spill into the secondary containment dike and pool at a rate of 115lbs. / min. This pool would vaporize at a rate of 1150 lbs in ten minutes. It is assumed that an ignition source would ignite this vapor cloud causing an explosion.
