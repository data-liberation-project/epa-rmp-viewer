We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\nA?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\nA?    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences that could be associated with accidental chemical releases\n\nA?

Our nitration facility produces pentaerythritoltetranitrate (PETN).  The detonating cord plant produces cords containing PETN, cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) and other secondary high explosives.  \n\nIn our processes, we may have on site the following chemicals, in quantities greater than the RMP threshold amount that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a subs"
