All applicable procedures of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  AMI Doduco's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA emergency response requirements.\nThe AMI Doduco\u00bfs (PR) manufacturing facility located at Road 992, km 0.3, Lot #2 Luquillo, PR has two (2) aboveground storage tanks located on the south side of the facility that is used to store liquefied anhydrous ammonia.   The liquefied ammonia is \u00bfcracked\u00bf using one of two high temperature dissociator units.  As the ammonia vapors pass through an electrically heated retort, heated to 1750 F, and over a nickel catalyst, the ammonia is cracked into a mixture of 75% hydrogen and 25% nitrogen.  The cracked ammonia is dried before entering individual electric furnaces where it creates a reducing internal furnace atmosphere.  \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling is performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA of 0.14 mg/l, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level-2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individuals ability to take protective actions.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined,  to estimate the population potentially affected.  \nAMI Doduco's general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n   High leve"
