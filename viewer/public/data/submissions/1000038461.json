Heartland uses and stores anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in their Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) in excess of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold of 10,000 lbs.  Heartland has an established Process Safety Management (PSM) program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphas the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for Heartland utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium.  The System contains eight (8) high stage compressors, four (4) low stage compressors and five (5) booster compressors.  The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling on four (4) of the compressors and thermosyphoning oil cooling on the remaining eight (8) compressors.\n\n\n\nThe System contains six (6) evaporative condensers to convert the high-pressure ammonia gas into high-pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high- pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory or 38,000 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia, included four (4) high stage recirculators, which provide high temperature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes two (2) low stage recirculators which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the low temperature accumulator to the suction of the low stage compressors. The discharge from the low stage compressors goes the high stage recirculators, which provide ammonia vapor to the suction of the high stage compressors.  The discharge from the high stage compresso"

EPAA?s RMP* Comp was used in the consequence analyses.\n\n\n\nWorst Case\n\n\n\nChemical and Amount Released: 38,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes inside the Ammonia Room.\n\n\n\nWeather Conditions: 77A?F with a 3.4 mph wind in Class F atmospheric stability.\n\n\n\nThe release would impact the rural area around Heartland within a 2.6-mile radius and affect 5,000 residents, a church, a cemetery, six (6) farm shops, a mini-storage facility, two (2) commercial businesses, a manufacturing facility, a private school and Mississippi Valley State University.\n\n\n\nAlternate Case\n\n\n\nChemical and Amount Released: 3,800 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes inside the Ammonia Room from a pin hole leak in the spiral freezer manifold.\n\n\n\nWeather Conditions: 77A?F with a 6.7 mph wind in Class D atmospheric stability.\n\n\n\nThe release would impact the rural area around Heartland within a 0.3-mile radius and affect 200 residents.\n\n\n\nHeartland is in compliance with the OSHA PSM and emergency action plan regulations, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 rules.  The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the Heartland Refrigeration System in good operation.\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases at Heartland during the last ten (10) years.\n\n\n\nThe equipment listed below is inspected daily.\n\n\n\nAll refrigeration compressors\n\n\n\nAll ammonia pumps\n\n\n\nAll condensers\n\n\n\nAll ice houses\n\n\n\nAll heat exchangers\n\n\n\nAll spiral freezers\n\n\n\nShould there be an ammonia release, the Itta Bena, Mississippi Fire Department (IFD) will respond.  Should the need for an evacuation to occur, the LeFlore County, Mississippi Sheriff's Department will notify all households within a 2.6-mile radius.\n\n\n\nAnnual in-house employee training programs maintain and continually improve safety at Heartland."
