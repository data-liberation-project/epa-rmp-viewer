      "SummaryText": "RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY. There are five (5) separate facilities at Seacoast Utility Authority (SUA) that store chlorine in amounts exceeding the threshold quantites listed in the EPA's Title 40CFR Part 68.130. The chlorine is used in the disinfection process for potable water and for disinfection of treated wastewater. SUA employs certified plant operators who are trained in all aspects of the hazardous nature of chlorine and the chlorination process to run the process. Retraining is done at least annually and chlorination equipment is inspected regularly and maintained.  Each location has a RMP written specifically for it. The Programs Coordinator developed the original RMP with assistance from the Chief Operator in charge of the subject facility, the facility's Department Manager, the Operations Director and an operator from another facility that has a chlorination process in use. The five positions listed make up the Process Hazard Analysis Team who used the EPA approved method titled \"What if/Checklist\" to analyze each process. Meetings were held at each facility to complete a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) using the combined knowledge of the team members and input and review by plant operators to gain a complete understanding of areas that could be improved to make the process as fail-safe as possible.  The management of SUA is committed to maintaining as well as improving the safety of each process that involves the use of chlorine. Evidence of this policy is clearly visible based on the history of improvements to the chlorination processes and the detailed written procedures which are followed by SUA plant operators. Examples of improvements are described later in this summary. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM. SUA maintains a written Emergency Response Program (ERP) in the Emergency Operations Plan. The ERP was developed to provide a prompt response to the release of chlorine gas while preserving the safety of the plant operators and the surrounding community. "

      "SummaryText": "The intent of the plan is to provide treatment plant operators a concise procedure regarding response to a release of chlorine gas regardless of the magnitude. The plan is divided into two scenarios, which relate to the severity of the release: minor leaks and major leaks. Minor leaks are handled by the plant operators on duty while major leaks are handled by the local Hazardous Material Response Team. Plant operators are trained at least annually in emergency response. All five facilities are equipped with a chlorine gas detector which constantly samples the air around the chlorine cylinder storage areas. If chlorine is present in the air an alarm is activated alerting the plant operators to begin the emergency response procedure.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION. The chlorine is contained in steel cylinders which hold one (1) ton of chlorine each. The five facilities at SUA that use chlorine have essentially the same type of equipment and arrangement to carry out the chlorination process. The chlorine is fed from the cylinder through a pressure to vacuum regulator then piped to a chlorinator followed by an injector which provides the vacuum to pull the chlorine from the cylinder into solution with potable water. This chlorine and water solution is then piped to one or more dosing points.  \n\nChlorine is stored under pressure in the aforementioned steel cylinders. Chlorine gas is dispensed from a cylinder by opening a valve that will allow chlorine gas to be piped to a chlorinator which is used to control the rate of chlorine used. To minimize the part of the system that operates under pressure a pressure to vacuum regulator is used. Since it is the pressure that would in most cases cause chlorine gas to be released, SUA has obtained equipment that will allow the regulator to be attached directly to the valve on the cylinder thereby making the cylinder the only part of the system that operates under pressure. The pressure to vacuum regulator provides another s"

      "SummaryText": "afety feature in that it will not allow chlorine gas to flow unless a constant vacuum is applied to the outlet end of the regulator. The vacuum is applied to the regulator by an injector located just after the chlorinator. This means the pipe carrying the chlorine gas to the chlorinator is under constant vacuum which pulls the chlorine gas through the regulator and chlorinator. If the piping or any system components following the cylinder are damaged the vacuum to the regulator would be lost causing it to close thus stopping the flow of chlorine gas. SUA maintains compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY. In the past five years there has not been a release of chlorine gas at any SUA facility that has caused injury to employees or resulted in concentrations exceeding those listed in Appendix A to part 68 (0.0087 mg/l) to extend offsite."
