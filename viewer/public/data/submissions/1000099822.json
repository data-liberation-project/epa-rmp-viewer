      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Prairie Ethanol LLC facility (d/b/a/ Poet Biorefining-Mitchell) is located approximately seven miles northwest of Mitchell, SD in Davison County.  Poet Biorefining-Mitchell's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in December 2006.  Poet Biorefining-Mitchell produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to convert starch to sugar.    Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\n\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 1,500,000-gallon storage tanks.  Natural Gas Condensate (NGC) denaturant is stored in Tank No. 802 and Tank No. 805, which have a capacity of 170,000 gallons (approximately 1,062,500 pounds) and 120,000 gallons (approximately 750,000 pounds) respectively.  NGC is blended with the ethanol as it is loaded into tanker railcars or trucks to make it unfit for human consumption as per federal and state requirements.   \n\n\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER EPA's CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical present at Poet Biorefining-Mitchell which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tank, the two (170,000 and 120,000) gallon storage tanks and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 1% to 3% as it's loaded into railcars or trucks.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the maximum capacity of the largest denaturant storage tank (Tank 802; approx. 1,062,500 pounds), located in the center containment area of the tank farm. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE EMERGENCY RE"

      "SummaryText": "SPONSE POLICY AND PROGRAM\n\nPoet Biorefining-Mitchell is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  In the event of an emergency, Poet Biorefining-Mitchell will implement the Emergency Action Plan (as per 29 CFR 1910.38) and direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Mitchell to notify the Letcher Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPoet Biorefining-Mitchell is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted and security cameras are in place. Personnel are on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a general computer based alarm system installed at the property.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has an excellent reco"
