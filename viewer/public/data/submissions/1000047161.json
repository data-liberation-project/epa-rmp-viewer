In addition, Sara Lee's ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices. \r\n\r\n Sara Lee has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic level controls and electric distribution system grounding).  In addition, Sara Lee has trained approximately 25 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HAZWOPER team).\r\n\r\n Sara Lee has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis.  Sara Lee encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters, employee participation meetings, and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sara Lee, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\r\n\r\n Sara Lee understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Sara Lee has implemented a preventative maintenance program.
