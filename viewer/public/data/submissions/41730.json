The covered process described in this submittal is an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system utilized in the warehousing of frozen and perishable food products.  Affiliated Foods, Inc. is committed to employee safety, protection of public health and the environment.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is listed as a regulated substance in 40 CFR 68.115 with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The design and construction of the system is in accordance with the applicable guidelines and recommendations of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians who are qualified and trained in accordance with the requirements OSHA, 1910.119.  These operators continuously monitor the system for any indication of leaks or equipment problems using a process control system and permanent, continuous ammonia detectors capable of distinguishing the presence of ammonia in the atmosphere down to a few parts per million.  In addition, the system is visually inspected via a walk-through checklist on a daily basis.  Any indication of deviation from process set points or leaks would result in the immediate isolation of the problem area from the remainder of the system and prompt repair.  Design, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system are conducted in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).  In the event that a leak should occur in the system in spite of precautions taken, the system is equipped with ammonia detectors that are located at strategic points throughout the facility.  These ammonia "

This Emergency Action Plan describes the notification protocol to be used in the event of an ammonia release.  The notifications in the event of a sudden release of over 100 lbs of ammonia would include the local fire department, the Randall / Potter County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the State Emergency Response Commission (TCEQ), and the National Response Center.  The fire department and the LEPC have been briefed on the Emergency Action Plan."
