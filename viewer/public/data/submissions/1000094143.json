Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\r\nSeadrift Coke L.P. is located on Texas Highway 185 South, one (1) mile south of the intersection of Texas State Highway 185 and Highway 35, Port Lavaca, Texas 77979. Our facility consists of one delayed coker and a rotary kiln. The primary product is calcined petroleum needle coke produced from decant oil feedstock. Byproducts from the coking process are gas oil, naphtha and fuel gas. Naphtha and fuel gas are regulated flammable substances.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS:\r\nA complete Hazard Analysis description and offsite consequence is filed with the PSM information on the facilities website.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS:\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental prevention program in place at Seadrift Coke L.P.. Since all the processes subject to the EPA RMP regulation are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:\r\nIt is the policy of Seadrift Coke L.P. to encourage and provide opportunities for all employees to participate in all aspects of our safety program consistent with the standards of the OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.

All information gathered and developed, as part of the\r\naccident prevention program is readily available to all employees. The employee participation policy is maintained and accessible to all employees on the plant computer.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION:\r\nSeadrift Coke L.P. maintains technical documents that are used in maintaining a safe operation. These documents address key process parameters, equipment design basis/configuration, chemical properties and associated hazards. Processes are maintained within limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instruments systems (e.g. automated shutdowns systems). Chemical-specific information, including emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which are available throughout the plant and on plant computers. Technical documents on design and construction of process equipment provide information about materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating, etc. This information is used as a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, and to evaluate proposed process and facility changes to ensure that process safety features are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS:\r\nSeadrift Coke L.P. is committed to an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of materials.

The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Seadrift Coke L.P. is coordinated with the Calhoun County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  Seadrift Coke L.P. has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Seadrift Coke L.P. conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. A CAN system (Community Alert Network) is in place to notify the public of any potential releases. It uses a telephone system to notify all neighbors including industry. It is tested periodically to check its readiness.  Seadrift Coke L.P. is also prepared for quick and effective mitigation of accidental releases by maintaining contracts with three large spill response organizations and an emergency management organization."
