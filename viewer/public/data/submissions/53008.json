      "SummaryText": "3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe McPherson Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil. The refinery is capable of processing over 80,000 barrels of crude oil and over 100,000 barrels of total feed stocks per day through its operation. The McPherson Refinery receives and transports petroleum products via trucks and pipelines and has a storage capacity of petroleum and refined products exceeding two million barrels in above ground tanks.\nSome processes at the refinery have the potential to contain the following regulated substances in amounts greater than Risk Management Program Threshold Quantities:  butane, propylene, hydrogen fluoride and propane.  Additionally, some processes at the refinery contain mixtures of flammable substances in amounts exceeding the threshold quantity.  The facility does manage hydrogen sulfide but is not responsible for reporting this chemical as part of the RMP submittal as the threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds and the facility manages 5,200 pounds.  This value is well below the threshold and therefore may be excluded from reporting requirements for RMP.\n\n4.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe McPherson Refinery has completed all hazard assessments required under the Risk Management Program rules.  Details of the Hazard Assessment are included in the RMP*Submit data.\n\n5.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because the processes at the refinery are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8501)\nThe McPherson Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management an"

This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedure, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between unit operators and management. Other examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating in the Union/Management Health and Safety Committee and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program through an electronic computer system called Mockingbird. This system allows employees to access to numerous drawings, procedures, and safety information.\n\nProcess Safety Information (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8503)\nThe McPherson Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automat"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nMuch of this information is available through the Mockingbird system that can be accessed from computers in the refinery, the maintenance shop and administrative offices. Employees can obtain additional information not found on Mockingbird through their supervisor and the engineering department.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8504)\nThe McPherson Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe McPherson Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the McPherson Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures (McPherson Refinery policy: Doc 8505)\nThe McPherson Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the McPherson Refinery maintains as part of the operating procedures, documentation that provides guidance on how to respond to exceeding upper or lower limits for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8506)\nTo complement the written proced"

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8507)\nThe McPherson Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and, inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, McPherson Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8509)\nThe McPherson Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: identification and categorization of process equipment, performing inspections and tests of process equipment, correcting identified deficiencies, applying quality assurance measures and documentation of these steps. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels) and meets the applicable regulatory codes and standards. If a deficiency is identified, corrections will be made before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are neces"

The McPherson Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc 8510 and other Safety Procedures)\nThe McPherson Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, the training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our personnel are trained to respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe McPherson Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil. The refinery is capable of processing over 80,000 barrels of crude oil and over 100,000 barrels of total feed stocks per day through its operation. The McPherson Refinery receives and transports petroleum products via trucks and pipelines and has a storage capacity of petroleum and refined products exceeding two million barrels in above ground tanks.\r\nSome processes at the refinery have the potential to contain the following regulated substances in amounts greater than Risk Management Program Threshold Quantities:  butane, propylene, hydrogen fluoride and propane.  Additionally, some processes at the refinery contain mixtures of flammable substances in amounts exceeding the threshold quantity.  The facility does manage hydrogen sulfide but is not responsible for reporting this chemical as part of the RMP submittal as the threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds and the facility manages 5,200 pounds.  This value is well below the threshold and therefore may be excluded from reporting requirements for RMP.\r\n\r\n4.0 HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe McPherson Refinery has completed all hazard assessments required under the Risk Management Program rules.  Details of the Hazard Assessment are included in the RMP*Submit data.\r\n\r\n5.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevent"

Because the processes at the refinery are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8501)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Each process unit has one employee representative in the position of Special Project Operator. This employee is responsible for writing and updating operating procedure, verifying P&ID drawings with engineers and interfacing between unit operators and management. Other examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating in the Union/Management Health and Safety Committee and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program through an electronic computer system called Mockingbird. This system allows employees to access to numerous drawings, procedures, and safety information.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8503)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe McPherson Refinery also maintains numerous mechanical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nMuch of this information is available through the Mockingbird system that can be accessed from computers in the refinery, the maintenance shop and administrative offices. Employees can obtain additional information not found on Mockingbird through their supervisor and the engineering department.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8504)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe McPherson Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the McPherson Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures (McPherson Refinery policy: Doc 8505)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8506)\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the McPherson Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8507)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and, i"

In addition, McPherson Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8508)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc. 8509)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation (McPherson Refinery policy: PSM, Doc 8512)\r\nThe McPherson Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
