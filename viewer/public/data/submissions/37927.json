Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed . The facility's emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe facility spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nHANDLED\n\nThe San Arroyo gas plant, located in rural Grand County, Utah, operates processes to recover petroleum products ( e.g. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from field gas. The NGL separated from the field gas is stored on site and is sold to others for further processing. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nA variety of technical documents are kept at the gas plant and used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents and their location is readily available to employees. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe gas plant has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and division management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The findings and recommendations from these updates are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the gas plant has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to\nperform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors\nare fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to make sure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  \n\nThe PSSR team may use a checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe gas plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nPersonnel who perform maintenance are trained on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency action plan and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that jobs are performed in a safe manner.

The gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe gas plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures\n(and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help make sure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the gas plant is periodically audited to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe gas plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release and (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors \n2. Flame detectors\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n 1. Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n 2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n 3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n 4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n 5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., reserve pneumatic supply for process control\n     system, backup pumps)\n 6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n 1. Fire extinguishers\n 2. Trained personnel\n 3. Personal protective equipment\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe San Arroyo gas plant, the five years prior to the effective date of the RMP regulation, did not have a release of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  \n\nEMERGENCY PLAN INFORMATION\n\nThe gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan.  There are no 112(r) threshold quantity toxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a regulated flammable substance, including the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire department, and mechanisms for notification are in place.
