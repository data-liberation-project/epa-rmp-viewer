Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareO requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 5 billion pounds of  chemical products in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Texas City Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Texas City Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold: \n? Vinyl Acetate\n? Chlorine\n? Isopropyl chloroformate\n\nThe plant has the following RMP-regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold:\n? 1,3-Butadiene\n? Propylene\n? Ethane\n? Methane\n? Propane\n? Ethylene\n? Hydrogen\n? Ethyl ether\n? Vinyl chloride\n\n3.    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA?s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries o"

Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \nWorst-Case Release Scenario ?\nVinyl Acetate: This scenario assumes that the failure of a vinyl acetate field storage tank releases 10,746,000 pounds of vinyl acetate as a liquid.  According to EPA?s Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following passive mitigation is used in this analysis:\n? Diking: The diking around the storage tank is designed to contain the liquid release. \nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n? Equipment Design and Construction: Design and construction codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n? Piping: Piping is welded to minimize the number of flanges.\n?

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n? Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n? Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n? Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n? Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n? Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Texas City Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Texas City/La Marque Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements "
