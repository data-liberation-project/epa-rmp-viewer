      "SummaryText": "Aldi, Inc. operates a cold storage warehouse in Haines City, FL.  At this facility, we store groceries for distribution to our stores in the area.  Like most cold storage warehouses, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material. Aldi is committed to maintaining a safe distribution operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management program to help us operate and maintain the system safely. Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We are provide a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify th"

      "SummaryText": "at they are within the original safe design limits.\n\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n\n- Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n\n- Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that could start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n\n- Emergency Response: We coordinate our response to emergencies, with the Medina County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n- Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\n- Compliance Audits: Approximately every three years, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n- Trade Secrets: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets program in case confidential information affecting the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.  We have had no accidents in the past five years.  As required by the EPA, we have analyzed \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this Risk Management Plan. The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents. The \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of a high-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes. As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 150 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.\n\n"
