This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of a variety of aerosol products. We have 2 regulated substances at our facility.  The first is Difluoroethane (Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-) which is used in our aerosol filling process as a propellant for the manufacture of compressed gas dusters and horns.  The other is Isobutane which is used on our filling process as a propellant for the manufacture of compressed gas horns.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, NFPA 30B, NFPA 13 standards.

Additional emergency shutdown stations have been added to expedite shutdown of the system in the event of emergency.  Continual modification of existing product equipment such as heat tunnel elevation, protective cages, additional guards, etc. have been implemented to reduce the possibility of injury.  Additional e-stops have also been added outside the aerosol fillers to allow exterior shutdown.  Using desktop scenarios, we continue to find the opportunity for improvements within the facility.\r\n\r\nA camera surveillance system has also been added to the facility to provide additional security and safety of the employees and facility. Security and first aid drills will also be added to the evacuation plan.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a 10,000 gallon tank we have implemented a modification to the existing deluge system to include coverage for the new tank and have upgraded all piping and sprinkler heads.  Existing facility sprinkler system has also been upgraded according to NFPA recommendations which protects all interior sections of the building.  Local authorities were involved in the process and ensured water flow will suffice in the event of an emergency.  Local fire officials were present during the installation and testing of the new deluge system every step of the way.\r\n\r\nAn additional higher technology filling line has also been added.  During the design phase many additional safety features were added to the filling line.  A central control panel automatically controls the mechanical functions of the filling line from feeding of the cans to the actuator placer.  Sensor and auto shut off features have been implemented throughout the line and thorough training has occurred throughout the process. \r\n\r\nAlong with the new filling line an additional Gunderson gas house was installed in our facility to accommodate the new equipment.
