The facility lies approximately 500 yards west of State Highway 99 and 500 yards north of State Highway 120 near the intersection of the two highways.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of light industrial facilities, commercial and office areas, some agricultural lands, and residential areas.\r\n\r\nThis facility stores ice cream and pizza products for distribution under approximately 98,000 square feet of total warehouse space, with approximately 70,000 square feet of refrigerated space.  The remaining areas include office areas, the control room, and the engine room.  There is no manufacturing at this facility.\r\n\r\nThe distribution center employs approximately 45 people and the refrigeration system operates 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nProcess Description\r\n\r\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a heat transfer fluid in the plant refrigeration system.  The system is a single-stage, multi-suction, economized mechanical refrigeration system that utilizes recirculated liquid feed to evaporator coils.  Cooling is required for the 10\u00b0F Shipping Dock and for the -20\u00b0F freezer.  The system charge is approximately 13,500 lbs.\r\n\r\nOne high-temperature screw compressor provides suction and compression for the high temperature cooling, while two low-temperature screw compressors serve the low-temperature cooling requirements.  A swing screw compressor can back-up either the high-temperature or low-temperature requirements as needed.\r\n\r\nThe heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporative condenser.  The condenser drains high-pressure liquid to the thermosyphon / high-pressure receiver for screw compressor cooling and Recirculator package liquid ammonia as required.  Liquid from the high-temperature Recirculator (HTR) and the low-temperature Recirculator (LTR) is pumped to"

The evaporator coils are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe release prevention elements included in the CalARP Program Manual provide the critical elements for preventing accidental releases.  Anhydrous ammonia is present in the refrigeration system above the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. and is, therefore, subject to the federal EPA RMP requirements and the OSHA PSM Standard.  The CalARP Program 3 release prevention steps have been implemented to satisfy all federal and state requirements for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Specifically, the elements of the release prevention program are:\r\n\r\n1.\tEmployee Participation Program\r\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\r\n3.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n4.\tOperating Procedures\r\n5.\tTraining\r\n6.\tContractors\r\n7.\tPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n8.\tMechanical Integrity\r\n9.\tH"
