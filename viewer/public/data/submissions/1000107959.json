The Ingevity North Charleston Plant's emergency response plan is contained in the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  This plan identifies the protocols and procedures utilized in an abnormal release or spill event when there is concern that it may lead to an emergency condition.  These plans define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying appropriate emergency response staff of potential emergency events.  This ensures that those with more significant possible consequences receive immediate priority for appropriate emergency response.  If an abnormal event indicates the potential for the release of a chemical and quantity that may lead to an emergency condition, the plant emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of response is determined by the Plant Emergency Coordinator or Incident Commander, with support from available emergency response and technical advisory staff.  \n\nTraining of responsible staff from both the North Charleston Chemical Plant and the Plant Emergency Response Team is designed to ensure that reliable communication and coordination occurs in any emergency situation.  The North Charleston Chemical Plant has a continuous safety improvement program which includes prompt investigation and reporting of all spill- or release-related events, even when there is no immediate threat of off-site exposure.  \n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIngevity, under the EPA Accidental Release Prevention program, as well as its PSM and SARA Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs has organized its management system to effectively address hazards and potential risks.

Formaldehyde solution is delivered to the site via tank truck in the form of a 37% aqueous solution and stored at slightly elevated temperature in an above ground tank with a 30,000 gallon (270,000 lb) capacity.  The tank is surrounded by a 30 ft x 30 ft dike that provides passive mitigation by limiting the surface area of a spill.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements defined as programs.  Ingevity has determined that the production process that uses formaldehyde is a Program 3 process.  Program 3 applies to processes that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) or listed among nine North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes.  The process belongs to a listed NAICS code (325199, industrial organics), and is subject to PSM.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan requirements for Program 3 processes are the same as those for the PSM standard.\n\n\n3.0   HAZARD ASSESSMENT RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Hazard Assessment under the ARP program consists of two parts; 1) a review of the five-year accident history involving regulated substances in the covered process and 2) a modeling evaluation of the impact associated with an accidental release.  There have been no accidental releases during the most recent five-year period that had an off-site impact, however, modeling of a worst-case release shows that off-site concentrations of formaldehyde would exceed the toxic endpoint concentration.  The Ingevity North Charleston plant is subject to Program 3 ARP requirements.\n\n3.1 Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn conjunction with the current ARP programs in place at the Ingevity facilities, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulate"
