If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to utilize our own response team and notify the Blanding City Fire Department and enlist their assistance if necessary.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThis facility processes uranium ores.  We use anhydrous ammonia as a reagent in the extraction process.  The process consists of two 140,000 pound tanks and associated valves and piping, and a propane storage tank of 110,000 pounds.\n\nGeneral Accidential Release Prevention and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  Extensive training and inspection of all processes is routinely performed.  The anhydrous ammonia process is designed, installed operated and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards, ASME standards and ANSI standards.  Tanks and piping are inspected daily.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nWe have never had any accident involving anhydrous ammonia or propane that caused deaths, injuries, propoerty or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia process, it is our policy to utilize our own response team and notify the Blanding City Fire Department and enlist their assistance if necessary.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and our own response team and members of the fire department have inspected our facility.  Our emergency response team trains regularly for anhydrous ammonia emergencies.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNo changes are planned at this time.
