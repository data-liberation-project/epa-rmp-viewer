      "SummaryText": "The Graham Wastewater Treatment Plant is located just west of Salt Creek and two miles south of Highway 67.  Our Wastewater Treatment Plant is an activated sludge plant.\n\nThe raw sewage comes into the plant at the Bar and Mechanical Screen Chamber.  This is part of the pretreatment stage where the rags, plastic and other large objects are removed.  The raw sewage continues to the oxidation ditch where there are four aeration rotors that are continuously stirring and mixing the sludge with the raw sewage.  A continuous and ample supply of air is required to be mixed with the sludge in the ditch with the raw sewage to provide the oxygen required by the bacteria.  The resulting mixed sludge flows by gravity to the clarifiers where the solids settle out.  The activated sludge settles in the clarifiers and separates from the water.  The clear effluent flows over the weirs to the contract chamber where the effluent is chlorinated.  TNRCC requires a chlorine residual of 1 MG/L in the effluent water when it leaves the contact chamber.  At this time we inject (SO2) sulphur dioxide to remove any remaining chlorine from the effluent.  From this point the effluent discharges into Salt Creek.\n\nAt the present time, we have three (3) one ton cylinders of chlorine at the Wastewater Plant.\nACCIDENTAL PREVENTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY\n\nWe have a list of safety rules that we follow when we handle chlorine.  If we have a small leak on the chlorine, our plant personnel will repair it, if we have a bad chlorine leak, we call the Fire Department.  We have the self contained breathing apparatus that the personnel wear while repairing chlorine leaks.  We inspect and maintain our equipment to reduce the risk of equipment break down and reduce the risk of accidents and chemical leaks.\n\nThe worse case release scenario would be if one of the 1 ton chlorine cylinders ruptured.  The alternative release scenario would be if we had a leak on the line or the regulator on the chl"

Never move chlorine cylinders without the protective valve hood in place.\n    3.    1 ton cylinders should be lifted with a suitable lifting beam and hoist that is designed to lift at least two tons.\n    4.    Keep all safety and related equipment clean, keep breathing air tanks filled, inspect all equipment regularly.\n    5.    1 ton cylinders should be stored above the floor or ground level on their sides on steel or concrete supports.  Protective valve shields should be in place.  These rules apply to empty and full cylinders.\n    6.    Keep storage free from combustible materials.\n    7.    Keep emergency phone numbers on hand and visible to any one who may need them.\n    8.    Only authorized, trained personnel should handle chlorine.  A minimum of two people should be present when connecting, disconnecting, loading or unloading chlorine cylinders, empty or full.  An acceptable escape mask should be in the immediate area and an approved supply of breathing air with full facial mask should be on the site and/or close at hand.  Remember chlorine can be fatal and should be treated with respect.\n\nThe five year accident history - We have had a good track record working with chlorine.  We haven't had a spill of any kind in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program - If we have a minor chlorine leak, the Plant Operator on duty will contact his supervisor to help him with the repair.  If we have a major chlorine leak, the Plant Operator will immediately call the Fire Department and his supervisor.  When the first Fire Department Official arrives on the scene, he will immediately notify his dispatcher and provide the following information:\n\n    1.    Location of the chemical spill.\n    2.    The type of hazardous chemical spill.\n    3.    Extent of immediate personal injuries.\n    4.    Estimate of the need for ambulances or passenger carrying vehicle for anticipated area evacuation.\n    5.    Wind "
