The vessel meets strict design and construction standards.  It is constructed of 1 inch-thick steel and wrapped with a 1 \u00bd inch-thick layer of insulation to help control the temperature and pressure inside the vessel. To prevent the vessel from over pressuring and releasing, the vessel has two relief valves.  These relief valves are tested every two years.  An isolation valve is located on the discharge of the vessel to shut off flow if there is a rupture downstream of the valve.  Numerous instrument alarms are in place to warn of potential equipment malfunction, including multiple pump malfunction.   In addition, we have a facility-wide leak detection and repair program to identify and repair leaks before they could ever result in an emergency.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from a chlorine rail car unloading hose.

It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to protect people, property and the environment.\n\n2.0  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of Aromatic Chemicals, Electrochemicals and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Resins.  We have two regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances are chlorine, and vinyl chloride monomer.  Chlorine and is used in the manufacture of vinyl chloride monomer.

Each unloading hose is inspected prior to each use, and the hose fittings are replaced whenever indications of visible wear are present.  There is a relief valve on every railcar to prevent the railcar and unloading hose from over pressuring.  We have instrument alarms to warn of potential equipment malfunction and equipment shutdowns to shut off flow.  Each station is monitored by an operator.  An automatic shutoff valve is located on each railcar to shut off flow if the unloading hose fails.  We have multiple remote block valves, check valves, and a control valve that can shut off flow to the railcar unloading line to isolate and limit any release.  An operator is located at all times within 100 feet of the railcars, which will ensure that the release can be manually isolated quickly.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM).  In this scenario 8500000 lb. of VCM is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.
