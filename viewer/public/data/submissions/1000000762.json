The site is leased from the US Army and has been operating at this site since 1949.  The siteA\u00bfs 24 employees utilize ammonia, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and iron as feed materials to produce Carbonyl Iron powder and Iron Pentacarbonyl.  Some of these feed materials and products are toxic substances specifically listed by the EPA in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Huntsville Plant has performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the installation, public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The Huntsville Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to the Huntsville Plant.  Alternative release scenarios can be useful in order to assist the RSA Installation Response Team (a.k.a. the RSA Fire Department) in improving their emergency response capabilities.  The information has been shared with the Redstone Arsenal Fire Department and other installation emergency/environmental personnel and is also available to local residents and businesses upon request.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe ISP Huntsville Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site employees, Redstone Arsenal (RSA) personnel, the public, and the environment.  For example, as a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In fact, in November of 2006, the site achieved RC14001/ISO14001 certification for its Environmental, Health & Safety, and Security Management System.  In addition, ISP coordinates with and adheres to all relevant Redstone Arsenal environmental, health, safety, and emergency response programs and procedures.  As part of ISP's over-all commitment to Environmental, Health and Safety activities, the facility has established various systems to help ensure the safe operation of processes at the site.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Huntsville Plant and provides compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One requirement of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Huntsville facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Huntsville Plant.\r\n\r\n1.1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nISPA\u00bfs Huntsville Plant is committed to the safety of on-site employees, RSA employees, and the public, and to the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  Further more, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any training deemed necessary on the changes.\r\n\r\n1.4.11 Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Huntsville Plant promptly investigates all accidents/incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and tracks such recommendations to completion.  The investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors if involved) who could be affected by the findings.
