The Facility Policy\n\na) The owners, management and employees of UAP Ag Service of McCook, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) The facility has been owned and operated by UAP Pueblo since March 18, 1998.  All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sales to growers as a fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed to farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nc) The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 130,000 pounds.  This represents filling the largest storage tank to 85% of capacity.  There are two large storage tanks on site, along with a number of portable tank trailers used to deliver the anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility either by bulk rail car or bulk truck.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of one of the storage tanks being released over a 10-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of a storage tank filled to 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The"
