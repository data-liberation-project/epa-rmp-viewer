The incident information is reviewed and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are notified.\n\nDuring the past 5 years (June 1994 to June 1999), there has been no accident involving any RMP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This means that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, emergency response, or damage to property or the environment.\n\n 6 .0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCargill's Blair plant has established an Emergency Action Plan that is designed to address foreseeable emergency situations at the facility and provide appropriate hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, contractors, emergency re"

In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Cargill has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenario that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for SO2.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). A review of climatological data for Omaha, NE, confirmed that conditions of D-stability and wind speeds of 3 m/sec and greater are typical of the area and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.\n\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using EPA's OCAG.  As with the worst-case scenarios, only the modeling results based on 'rural' surface conditions are included in the Risk Management Plan, in order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates. However, it should be noted that, under actual conditions, plume dispersion would be enhanced by the 'urban' type surfaces near the facility, and result in shorter distances to toxic endpoint. This is especially true for alternative releases, where distances to toxic endpoints are typically less than the worst-case.  \n\n3.2.1 Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe alternative SO2 release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break in the SO2 unloading assembly at the delivery railcar.  A break in the unload assembly might occur if, for example, the railcar was bumped/pushed while unloading SO2.  For this sc"

      "SummaryText": "enario, the assumptions have been made that the SO2 railcar track has not been locked out and the railcar wheels have not been chocked in accordance with standard unload procedures.  Also, it is assumed that the railcar is pushed far enough to take up all the slack in the flexible hose portion of the apparatus; and that all automatic interlocks on the system fail to engage.  \n\nA break in the unloading assembly of this type would result in a hole in the unloading assembly of approximately 1.0 inch in diameter.  The pressurized release of SO2 through hole of this size would result in two-phase flow (vapor and liquid) as the pressurized SO2 flashed to the vapor state.  The modeling showed that SO2 would be released at a rate of 1600 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the sulfur dioxide would then be dispersed as a heavy gas and the excess flow valve in the railcar would not engage.  Cargill has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of SO2, resulting in a total release of 48,000 lbs.  This alternative SO2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the worst-case.  \n\nThe OCAG indicates that under rural conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would extend a relatively short distance beyond the facility boundary, potentially encompassing nearby public receptors, including residential areas, schools, public recreation areas and industrial/commercial areas.  The only environmental receptor that could be affected is Desoto Bend Wildlife Refuge.\n\n3.3 Worst-Case Release for Flammable Substances\n\nFor regulated flammable substances a worst-case release of a flammable substance is defined as an instantaneous spill of the entire contents from the single largest vessel and the worst-case flammable endpoint is an overpressure of 1 psi resulting from an ensuing vapor cloud explosion.

Emergency situations can include fire, explosion, chemical release or spill, bomb threat, weather emergencies and other natural emergencies.  Due to the ongoing risks that are presented by weather emergencies like tornadoes, the plant has in place an emergency plan to protect both the plant operational integrity and the safety of its workers and neighbors from weather emergencies.  In regards to chemical releases, Cargill has developed a command structure and specific procedures that must be adhered to in the unlikely event of a chemical emergency.  These procedures define the criteria for identifying, classifying, and notifying the appropriate emergency response staff of potential emergency events. If a chemical release is detected on-site, the emergency response team is notified and the most appropriate mode of response is determined by the Incident Commander, with support from available emergency response (HAZ-MAT) teams and technical advisory staff.  Each Department in the facility must also follow a specific Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control Plan in the event of a chemical release. \n\nPlant operations at the Blair facility can present various types of potential hazards and Cargill recognizes the need to have a well trained and prepared work force to safely and effectively deal with any emergency situation.  The Cargill Blair facility provides training of responsible staff and the exercise of important communication links with the community, in order to maintain an appropriate state of readiness for emergency situations.  Cargill Blair plant staff attend periodic meetings with local industry and emergency response planning officials and have participated in emergency response training exercises.

This includes insuring that all regulatory reporting requirements are met.\n\nPlant management is fully informed as to the materials which are stored or used on-site and aware of the possible risk associated with their handling, storage, use, disposal or accidental release.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all materials utilized at the plant are maintained on-site and reviewed bi-annually.  The plant maintains up-to-date procedures to insure the proper control of hazardous materials. Procedures and systems are devised which include provisions for the periodic testing, review, and update of the emergency response programs. \n\nEmployees are trained and periodically retrained in the methods of detection of hazardous material releases, the potential physical and health risks associated with the mate"

Access to the site by vendors, employees and visitors is controlled by fencing and security check points.  \n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) is the only toxic chemical utilized in the corn milling process department at the Blair facility that is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68. Natural gasoline, a mixture of several regulated flammable substances (23.5% isopentane, 21.0% pentane and 2.6% butane) is used as a denaturant in the ethanol production process.  Because this mixture contains more than 1% of one or more regulated substances and has an National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability rating of 4, the entire mixture is regulated under RMP. Although both of these processes are regulated, they are subject to different Risk Management Program requirements.  \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).

The Cargill Accident Prevention Program elements are adopted directly from the compliance program for the PSM standard and are consistent with the Level 3 RMP Program requirements for this Cargill facility under 40 CFR Part 68.  The Program 3 Risk Management Program for the Process department is described in Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Executive Summary and specific information is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nRMP Program 1 is applicable to the ethanol production process because 1) as shown in Section 3, the effects of a worst-case release scenario would not extend off-site and 2) as discussed in Section 5, there have been no accidental releases of natural gasoline in the ethanol process over the past five years that have resulted in off-site consequences.

The corn is processed using wet mill technology.  The starch is separated from the corn and sent to a refinery.  The refinery breaks the starch molecule down to produce dextrose.  The dextrose is sent to fermentation where the yeast produce alcohol.  The alcohol is separated from the rest of the fermentation broth.  Natural gasoline is added to the alcohol prior to storage in accordance with BATF  denatured regulations.

For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-cases defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Cargill to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case, and alternative cases, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For toxic gases such as SO2, stored at ambient temperatures it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic endpoints, is considered the worst-case release for each facility.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established toxic endpoints for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.

Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are documented so that information about the safe handling of chemicals present at the facility is available to all employees, and can be interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Incident Commander. This is especially important when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at the Blair plant lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even safer tomorrow.\n\nCargill Blair's safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of on-going evaluations of in-plant safety and program effectiveness."

Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour.\n\nRisk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (EPA 550 B-99-009) (OCAG) provides a basic screening-level approach to estimating endpoint distances, although the RMP rule also allows other more refined modeling methods to be used.  Sulfur dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than the ambient air.  Therefore, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such cases, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  The Dense Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1) was developed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to model dense gas releases and its use has been approved by the U.S. EPA.  The model is designed to predict the dispersion of dense gases from ground level releases over flat, level terrain.  For these reasons, DEGADIS was used to model the worst-case release scenario.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally"

In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Cargill has elected to model the release assuming a rural surface roughness.  A rural surface roughness value of 10 cm, which is consistent with the land use surrounding the facility, was utilized in the DEGADIS model.\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducted assuming a very stable atmosphere with limited dispersion (F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed).  Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Omaha, NE indicates that these dispersion conditions occur approximately 5% of the time (or about 1.2 hours per day, on average).  The toxic endpoint for SO2 is 0.0078 mg/L.  Since the resulting endpoint distance predicted for the worst-case SO2 toxic release potentially extends to public receptors, the regulated process at the Cargill Blair facility that uses SO2 is subject to Program 3 requirements. \n\n3.1.1 Worst-Case Release: Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Blair facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 304,000 lbs of stored SO2, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.

The closest environmental receptor is the Desoto Bend  Wildlife Refuge. \n\nCargill has established separate written emergency response plans to coordinate with local industrial facilities in the unlikely event of a chemical release.  Cargill also notes that it is impossible to release 304,000 lbs of SO2 in 10 minutes because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid SO2 would not be available.  Even if the storage tank were to breach, SO2 would spill to the ground in a boiling liquid pool.  If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  However, Cargill evaluated this 10 minute release to comply with the noted regulation.\n\n3.2 Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the process hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors.

According to the RMP regulation, the mass of flammable material involved in the vapor cloud explosion is defined as the amount that would be evaporated in the 10-minute period immediately following the spill under worst-case meteorological conditions.  Worst-case meteorological conditions for a liquid spill are defined as a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, atmospheric stability category F and the highest daily temperature over the past 3 years. A review of National Weather Service (http://www.nws.noaa.gov/) climatological data at Blair, NE indicated a recorded high temperature over the least three years (2000, 2001, 2002) of 104\u00b0F.  For a flammable mixture, the evaporation of each component is computed separately and the combined heat of combustion of the evaporated substances are accounted for in the computation of the 1 psi overpressure distance.  The 1psi distance is based on the TNT equivalent method, applying a 10% yield factor.\n\n\n3.3.1 Natural Gasoline\n\nFor the worst-case spill of natural gasoline it is assumed that the entire 90,000 gallon (about 500,000 lbs) contents of the storage tank is instantaneously released into the dike which has a surface area of approximately 21,500 square feet.  The ambient temperature and the temperature of the natural gasoline are assumed to be 105o F.  Over the first 10 minutes after the release about 40,000 lbs of the flammable mixture would evaporate.

Given that the distance of the nearest Cargill facility site boundary from the natural gasoline storage tank is about 0.34 mile, no public receptors would be affected by a worst-case release.
