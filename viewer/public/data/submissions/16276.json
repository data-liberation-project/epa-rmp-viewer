      "SummaryText": "he car is equipped with an outlet dome that is approved by the Chlorine Institute. The dome contains two liquid and two gas outlet valves as well as a relief valve that will vent to the atmosphere in the event of internal pressure conditions over 375 psi. Each liquid outlet line has an excess flow valve, which will shut tight in case of a break in the angle valves or in the chlorine unloading pipeline. This shut-off rate is approximately 15,000 lb/hr. The cars are insulated with 4-6 inch cork or combination fiber glass and foam insulation, and covered with an outer steel jacket for minimizing vaporization and pressure build up during transportation. Currently, the rail car vendor is Pioneer.\n\n*** Storage Tank: If the 60 ton rail car empties prior to receiving a full one, the TST Inc. plant utilizes liquid chlorine from a 12 ton storage tank. The tank is constructed in accordance with the Department Of Transportation (DOT) regulations and Chlorine Institute. guidelines. It has a minimum of 4 inch insulation and is covered with a protective metal jacket to minimize vaporization and pressure build up. Further, there are two liquid valves, two gas outlet valves, an excess flow valve, and a safety pressure relief valve. The latter releases chlorine gas to the atmosphere should the internal pressure exceed 225 psi. The excess flow valve is designed to shut-off the chlorine flow should the unloading chlorine rate exceed 7,000 lb/hr. The storage tank is owned by DX Systems.\n\n*** Expansion Chamber: Feed lines that transfer the liquid chlorine from the storage area to the vaporizer contain one expansion chamber. The chamber prevents chlorine liquid line rupture by averting pressure build up in the pipeline. This is accomplished by a rupture disk, which will burst at 250 psi, allowing expansion of chlorine.\n\n3.1.2 Vaporizer\n\nThere is one chlorine vaporizer to handle the amount of chlorine required for the production of aluminum ingots. The vaporizer is capable of vaporizing 1,"

The major components associated with the vaporizer are described below.\n\n*** Chlorine Expansion Shell: Liquid chlorine is transferred from the chlorine storage vessels to the vaporizer's expansion shell, which is rated at 250 psig. The expansion shell has a chlorine level sensor, which is constructed of a steel chamber and has a Monel float and trim. Tubes, constructed of nickel, are immersed in the chlorine bath and carry hot water. The water is heated to approximately 120 degrees F by either a gas or electric water heater to provide the necessary heat to vaporize the liquid chlorine. Also, the chlorine expansion shell is equipped with a pressure relief valve rated at 250 psi.\n\nThe chlorine gas leaves the chlorine expansion shell at approximately 80 degrees F, passes through a cast carbon steel strainer where any impurities are retained, through the pressure reducing valve where the pressure is reduced to 40 psi, and continues on to the TIMCO furnaces, to the tandem flux units and the water cooling tower chlorine injector.\n\n4.0 DESIGN AND OPERATION\n\n4.1 DESIGN AND SAFETY FEATURES\n\nThe TST Inc. facility was designed to operate to produce aluminum alloys by using chlorine efficiently.\n\nA fence encloses the entire facility with restricted access at manned gates. All visitors must check in at the office and must sign in. The following subsections describe the safety and design features of the TST Inc. plant.\n\n4.1.1 AHM Process Flow Lines\n\nProcess gas lines, which handle significant quantities of chlorine, are constructed primarily from steel. The exceptions to this are the flexible pipes off the rail car and the storage tank, and the hoses just before each furnace. All flexible hoses are made of chlorine compatible materials. \n\n4.1.2 Emergency Power Features\n\nIn case of a power failure, the pump that circulates the hot water inside the tubes in the vaporizer will stop."

      "SummaryText": "In addition, the water flow switch will shut down the automatic shut off valve, which stops the chlorine supply to the vaporizer. With these safe guards the system will shut down safely.\n\n4.1.3 Safety Features\n\nThere is an expansion chamber with a pressure switch on line between the rail car/storage tank and the vaporizer. Should the pressure in the line exceed 250 psi, the rupture disc will burst, and the pressure switch will activate visual and audible alarms at the control panel in case of overpressure conditions. Pneumatic control valves will close at the railcar and bulk storage tank.\n\nAnother safety feature is the pressure relief valve on the vaporizer that will relieve should the pressure in that vessel exceed 250 psi. Meanwhile the pressure switch on the vaporizer will close the automatic shut off valve, which will also stop the chlorine supply to the vaporizer. Additionally, the high level switch on the vaporizer will close the automatic shut off valve should the chlorine level exceed a certain level. The automatic shut off valve will have to be manually reset after the cause of the shut down is corrected.\n\nAnother safety characteristic of the chlorine process system is the flow switch that is present on the water system side. The switch will activate the automatic shut off valve should the pump or the power supply fail.\n\n4.2 BUILDING CODES\n\nAll buildings were constructed according to local, state, and federal codes at the time of construction. The buildings were constructed in 1979.\n\n4.3 CHLORINE HANDLING PRACTICES\n\nThe operations manual (written procedures) regarding rail car set up procedures, connecting/disconnecting procedures, rail car padding procedures, and fixed tank and vaporizer start up/shut down procedures are kept in the maintenance and engineering office. The procedures are reviewed and kept by the Engineering/ Maintenance department, and the Engineering Manager will be responsible for updating the manuals as needed.\n\n4.4 STANDARD OPERATING"

Chlorine gas is heavier than air.\n\nFrom the technical studies conducted, chlorine releases from the most likely hazards at the TST Inc. facility would result from a flange leak. These flanges are used to connect the flex lines to the 1 inch steel lines. They are flanges designed for chlorine service, approved for use by the Chlorine Institute and use a lead gasket as a seal. These releases are quite small and impact neither TST Inc. employees nor the public. They are easily detected and repaired. When they do occur, it is during the connecting/disconnecting operation. According to the Operating Procedures, the operator making the connection/disconnection will be donned in a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) while another one will be on stand by wearing a SCBA. During the connecting operation, all lines will be leak checked, and if a leak is found the operator will rapidly isolate the upstream valve. This greatly limits the volume of chlorine released, and these small releases are not even detectable 15-20 m from the flange.\n\nHazards that either had low or medium probability of occurrence are mitigated by the following measures:\n*** Mitigation 1: The remotely activated shut off valve upstream of the rail car/storage"

This mitigation provides a fast response in shutting down the system should a line rupture occur.\n*** Mitigation 2: The remotely activated shut off valve immediately downstream of the pressure reducing valve. This valve is interlocked with chlorine sensors located along the piping outside the furnace buildings. This prevents chlorine flow should the pipe downstream the vaporizer fail.\n\nThe worst case scenario: Both the 60 ton rail car and the 12 ton stationary tank were included in this scenario since they are interconnected through piping. This scenario represents a catastrophic event with a next to nothing chance of occurring. The specifics for this event are having both tanks completely full (72 tons total) and releasing the contents in 10 minutes. In order for this scenario to happen, multiple angle valves, normally closed, would have to be open as well as automatic shut-off valves and excess flow valves would have to fail, along with multiple punctures to both vessels. \n\nThe alternate scenario: This release scenario represents the maximum chlorine release that could occur if the piping downstream of the rail car ruptured and the internal excess flow valve closed immediately after the break (flow rate exceeded 15,000 lb/hr). Thus, this release scenario is a liquid chlorine release of the volume enclosed in the pipeline between the rail car and the vaporizer plus all the chlorine mass in the vaporizer and up to the pressure reducing valve (backflow from the vaporizer). Further, an additional 10% chlorine mass was included to account for unknowns in the volume of the system and to allow time for the  excess flow valve to close. Thus, the total chlorine mass released was calculated to be 77 lbs. Using a two-phase release model for a 1 diameter hole in the pipe, the release rate was calculated to be 8.8 lbs/sec which would yield a total release t"

Therefore, the release was assumed to be 1 minute in duration with total release mass of 77 lbs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nE.1 OVERVIEW\n\nIn response to 40 CFR Part 68, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed for the TST Incorporated facilities located in San Bernardino County. The results from this RMP will:\n*** Help protect the public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHM). \n*** Assist TST Inc. and the local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling AHMs.\n \nThe TST Inc. facility is an aluminum recycling plant that produces specification aluminum alloys from aluminum scrap and virgin metal. The Acutely Hazardous Material present at the facility and the focus of this program is chlorine, present as a gas and liquid.\n\nThe TST Inc. facility uses two processes to treat feedstock metal ultimately producing aluminum ingot and billet. Although the two processes are similar in that they both use chlorine they differ in that the raw aluminum feedstock is of different quality. Both processes use chlorine which is stored in a liquid form in a rail car (60 ton), and a storage tank (12 ton). In addition chlorine is used to treat process water.\n \nChlorine from the rail car or storage tank is piped to the vaporizer where it is heated under pressure and converted to a gaseous state. The chlorine gas is then piped to the furnaces and the process water system via a chlorine injector. In the furnaces, it is sparged into melted aluminum feedstock where it removes magnesium and other alloy constituents. At the water tower, chlorine is used for treatment of microbiological growth. Chlorine gas is used in trace concentrations to remove oxide inclusions from the molten aluminum while casting aluminum billet.\n\n1.0 FACILITY DESCRIPTION \n  \n1.1 FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe TST Inc. facility is an aluminum recycling facility that began operating in 1984.

The surrounding area is industrial and agricultural. \n\nThe AHM process equipment is located in and around the vaporizer room, inside the furnace building, and inside the billet foundry building. Liquid chlorine is piped from one of the chlorine storage vessels to the vaporizer room where it is converted into gas. Feed lines guide the gaseous chlorine to the TIMCO furnaces and chlorine injector at the Tandem water cooling tower. In the billet foundry building, chlorine gas is piped into flux units from the gas side of the bulk storage tank. \n\n1.2 OPERATION THEORY\n\nLiquid chlorine is stored at the TST Inc. facility in one 60 ton rail car, and one 12 ton fixed bulk storage tank. The rail car and storage tank are stored outside the vaporizer room. The chlorine from the rail car and storage tank is used for the production of aluminum ingots while the chlorine from the bulk storage tank is used for the production of aluminum billets and as a back-up to the 60 ton rail cars. The two processes are described below.\n\n***Production of aluminum ingots: Liquid chlorine flows from either the rail car or the storage tank to the vaporizer which is capable of vaporizing 1,000 pounds of chlorine per hour. While both the rail car and storage tank can be used interchangeably, the normal mode of operation utilizes chlorine from the rail car at a rate of approximately 250 pounds/hour. The chlorine enters the vaporizer as a liquid, becomes heated via a hot water tube exchanger, and exits the vaporizer as a gas. The chlorine gas exits the vaporizer through the gas discharge line and continues on to the furnaces. In the furnaces, it is sparged into melted aluminum via gas injection molten metal pumps.\n\n\n***Production of aluminum billets: Chlorine gas is drawn off the bulk storage tank and piped into flux units where it is used as a scavenger to remove hydrogen and inclusions from the melt i"

There has been a total of five accidents during this period, with the largest release estimated to be 1 pound of chlorine. All of the releases had been confined to the facility premises with no off site consequences. \n\nAn accident investigation program exists at the TST Inc. facility and is triggered in case an accident/incident occurs. Causes of incidents are identified and corrective measures are suggested, evaluated, implemented, and verified. The accidents/incidents are supplemented by Emergency Services personnel when called to respond.\n\nThe accident investigation is conducted by the Department Supervisor, Engineering/Maintenance Manager, and Plant Manager and consists of examining the contributing factors in terms of: man, machine, material, methods practiced and environment. This program has been further developed to include at the minimum the following:\n*** A Fact Finding Meeting: When an accident/incident occurs, the personnel must report it to their Shift Supervisor who will notify the plant manager who will in turn determine if the event requires an accident investigation.
