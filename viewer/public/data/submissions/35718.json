BTU Gases has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) and PHA update on the LP-gas distribution and storage process and currently implementing recommendations made to further improve the safe operation of this process.  As a result of the PHA study (conducted using the Hazard and Operability or HAZOP method), in order to avoid an accidental release due to a pull away during loading/unloading operations, BTU Gases has revised the loading and unloading operating procedures to require that chock blocks be placed at the tires on the passenger side of the cargo tank vehicles.  This would ensure that the operator or driver walks around the vehicle to check before driving away.  Additionally, in order to prevent overfilling, the procedures were revised to ensure that the operator or the driver stays by the cargo tank vehicle and/or the storage tank during the entire transfer operation to monitor the gauges during filling.  \n\nAdditionally, BTU Gases will be installing passive and remote shutdown systems on cargo tank vehicles at the next scheduled presssure test, as required by DOT.\n\nAdditional improvements that BTU Gases will be implementing before the end of 2005 include the following:\n? Additional reviews and revisions to operating procedures to ensure continued safe operations.\n? Documentation of all preventative maintenance and inspections that are being done and addition of requirements to address tank rust issues.\n? Review and improve incident investigation system.\n?

The facility is designed to distribute and store the following LP-gases: propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, isobutylene, and butylene.  The primary purpose of the facility is to repackage and distribute LP-gases to both retail and wholesale customers for use as a fuel.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the BTU Gases facility because the facility handles and stores the following RMP-regulated flammable gases: propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, isobutylene, and butylene in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1. ?112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  BTU Gases is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its LP-gas distribution and storage facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  BTU Gases, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department.\n2. Risk Management Plan - The BTU Gases LP-gas distribution and storage facility handles and stores propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, isobutylene, and butylene in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of ?112(r), BTU Gases management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of flammable gases.  Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency evacuat"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP definition for a ?process?, the LP-gas distribution and storage facility is defined as one process consisting of ten tanks that are interconnected or that can be interconnected at any one time.  Tanks #1 and 10 hold propane; Tanks #2, 5 and 9 hold propylene; Tanks #3 and 8 hold n-butane; Tank #4 holds isobutane; Tank #6 holds butylene; and Tank #7 holds isobutylene.  \n\nBTU Gases has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  BTU Gases has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures. In addition, BTU Gases has coordinated with local emergency responders including the Pearland Volunteer Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nBTU Gases? management is committed to the following:\n- Preventing accidents;\n- Training our employees in correct procedures in the event of an accident;\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with BTU Gases operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n- Being a good corporate citizen of Brazoria County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the LP-gas process.  Most important, BTU Gases stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe operation for its employees, its visitors, and its community.\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, BTU Gases is in compliance with the OSHA PSM, EPCRA, and Department of Transportation Texas Railroad Commission NFPA 58 requirements.
