In August of 1995, Bozzuto's completed construction of a state of the art warehouse distribution center.  Among its advantages, this distribution center utilizes the benefits of ammonia as a refrigerant. Bozzuto's does recognize ammonia as a potentially hazardous chemical, and this was a consideration when selecting the refrigerant for the facility. In consideration of the risks associated with the use of ammonia, Bozzuto's commits its efforts to ensuring the employees and surrounding community continue to enjoy a healthy and safe environment.  \nPart of this commitment includes:\n>    Employing only skilled refrigeration technicians;\n>    Contracting with only experienced ammonia refrigeration contractors;\n>    Organizing an in-house Emergency Response Team;\n>    Coordination with the Cheshire Fire Department;\n>    Partnering with a hazardous materials release contractor; and\n>    Maintaining communication with the Cheshire Town Manager, the designated     Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nAccidental release prevention is the approach Bozzuto's has taken to minimize and possibly eliminate the potential for an accidental release.  Bozzuto's exercises ongoing preventive maintenance and equipment integrity procedures.  Some of theses program include:\n>       Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\n>       Hazard Communication, and\n>       Lockout / Tagout.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBozzuto's maintains a twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week coverage of trained Security Officers.  If an emergency were to arise, the notifier will dial an emergency extension and be connected to a Security Officer. The Security Officer will gather the information and initiate the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nHaving"

      "SummaryText": " this continuous coverage reduces the response time in an emergency condition, thereby minimizing the consequences.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBozzuto's views the risk of accidental release very seriously.  Accidental release prevention programs include:\n>    Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\n>    Hazard Communication, and\n>    Lockout / Tagout. \n\nThrough a Process Hazard Analysis, Bozzuto's tries to identify a potential accidental release condition by asking \"What If\" a certain scenario were to occur, a piece of equipment were to fail, etc.?  Solutions are then developed to prevent or limit these conditions from happening.\n\nIf an incident were to happen, an investigation would take place, and new procedures would be implemented so a similar occurrence could be prevented.\n\nAll Bozzuto's prevention programs are audited at regular intervals to validate their effectiveness; the objective is to be proactive in preventing accidental releases, not reactive.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBozzuto's is proud of the fact there have been no accidents related to an ammonia release since startup in 1995.  With the current practice of education, preventive maintenance, and commitment, Bozzuto's strives to minimize the potential for any accidents in the future.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nBozzuto's Emergency Response Plan is organized in multiple levels of response, many of which are by trained Bozzuto's employees.  The Emergency Response Team is the core of the response plan.  This team is trained in the Emergency Response Plan procedures and implementation.  The Emergency Response Team meets to review procedures and discuss new and improved methods of response.  Among the benefits of having a trained in-house response team are reduced response time and more immediate decision making capabilities; these qualities greatly contribute to minimizing the effects in the event of an actual emergency.\n\nThe Cheshire Fire Department is located approximately 3 miles from Bozz"

They are an important part of Bozzuto's Emergency Response Plan, and are kept current with Bozzuto?s facility information.\n\nBozzuto's continues to revise and improve its Emergency Response Plan.  This effort is part of Bozzuto's commitment to the health and safety of its employees and community.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBozzuto's is continually looking for new ways of improving the safety level of its employees and community.  Bozzuto's continues to work with an experienced hazardous materials spill contractor.  The intention of the partnership is to provide Bozzuto's additional specific expertise in the field of hazardous materials release procedures and prevention.  Continuing discussions and exercises are planned to ensure an efficient and prompt response time.\n\nIn the past three years Bozzuto?s has installed computerized automatic ammonia release detection and shutdown equipment. This equipment provides a built-in level of emergency response by immediately isolating and shutting down equipment if an ammonia leak is detected.\n\nBozzuto?s plans to continue its efforts and commitment to health and safety."
