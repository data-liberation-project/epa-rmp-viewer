      "SummaryText": "Jack Frost Fruit Company, Inc. operates an apple packing warehouse and refrigeration storage in the northwest part of Yakima, Washington on 2820 River Road.  Apples are harvested and loaded in regular cold storage rooms and controlled atmosphere rooms over a several week period in the fall.  Apples are removed from the storages and are washed, sorted, and packaged for fresh fruit markets, year round.  The packaged apples are stored in refrigerated rooms until shipment. A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system every work day and a continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat.  It is present as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor in the system.  There is 11,759 pounds ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nTo maintain a safe facility operation the Jack Frost Fruit Company, Inc. has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). A majority of all refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system and any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem.  Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures).  All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan with annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant, and has in place both the OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68).  These programs are readily available"

      "SummaryText": "to on-site personal to help in maintaining a safe operating facility.  As required by the RMP an \u00bfOff-site Consequence Analysis\u00bf has been done for the facility to determine what impact the \u00bfWorse Case\u00bf, and the more realistic \u00bfAlternate Case\u00bf releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years.\n\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia Jack Frost Fruit Company, Inc. maintains an ongoing relationship with an experienced refrigeration contractor less than \u00bd mile away in Yakima.  In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away. The facility was an action plan, not a response plan, so it is not expected or intended that employees would attempt to enter the facility until proper trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive.\n\nJack Frost Fruit Company, Inc. is taking many steps to improve the safety at the facility in the next 12 months.  All of the refrigeration computer controls will be updated with new computers and software.  Smoke detectors will be added and ventilation will be increased in the machine rooms and ammonia detection will be added to several unprotected locations."
