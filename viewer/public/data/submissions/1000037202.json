To manufacture these quality pulps to specific customer specifications, Rayonier uses four chemicals subject the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The Fernandina Mill is classified as NAICS Code 32211 and is consequently subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  These same four substances are also subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations and are listed below:  \n\n1. Ammonia (anhydrous)\n\n2. Chlorine\n\n3. Chlorine dioxide\n\n4. Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\n\nAmmonia and sulfur dioxide are used to make up cooking acid for pulps.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used as bleaching chemicals in the process. \n\nThe current quantity of chlorine dioxide reported in this update for the chlorine dioxide covered process is significantly lower than the reported quantity in the previous RMP submissions. This change is the result of the exclusion of the chlorine dioxide inventory in the unit?s main storage tank.  The concentration of chlorine dioxide in the main storage tank is 0.8% or 8 ppm chlorine dioxide. This concentration is below the 1.0% minimum level specified in the RMP regulation. The 1009 pounds of chlorine dioxide reported in this update represents the calculated quantity of chlorine dioxide in the mill?s ClO2 generators. The generator system produces ClO2 at concentrations above 1% and the contents are subject to the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.3    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nReporting requirement removed. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.4   PREVENTION PROGRAM - PROGRAM 3\n\n\n\nRayonier Performance Fibers Fernandina Mill is subject to both EPA and OSHA process safety management regulations.

The PSM standard requirements for PSI are identical to those required by the RMP in 40 CFR 68.65.  This compilation of written process safety information enables Rayonier and the employees involved in operating the processes to identify and understand the possible hazards posed by those processes involving toxic substances.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the toxic substances used in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\n\n\n\nPSI has been collected and updated for Rayonier's four RMP process systems: ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Material Data Safety Sheets (MSDS), block flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P & IDs), and equipment information are stored in the PSM Information books, drawings, and equipment files.\n\n\n\n1.4.2    Process Hazard Review\n\n\n\nRayonier?s Fernandina Performance Fibers Mill has performed an initial Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) on all four covered processes as well as periodic analyses as required by the PSM/RMP regulations.

In addition to operating procedures, safe work practices have been developed and implemented for the control of hazards and include hot work, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, lockout/tagout, and control over the entrance into a stationary source.  These safe work procedures are in place and are reviewed and revised as needed, but at least on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4    Training\n\n\n\nEach employee at Rayonier's Fernandina Specialty Pulp Products Mill involved in operating a covered process has been trained to operate it safely and understands the training.

Under the RMP rule 40 CFR 68.73, Rayonier has adopted this mechanical integrity system.  The system ensures that the process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases.  It includes written procedures, training, inspection, and testing, correcting system deficiencies and quality assurance.  These tasks are discussed further in the PSM Mechanical Integrity manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.6    Management of Change\n\n\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is in place at Rayonier to prevent changes in the process and supporting equipment from introducing unacceptable hazards to workers.  This MOC system has written procedures for managing changes to be made to a PSM/RMP covered process.  The procedures require review prior to the change with a special emphasis on safety and training of employees and contractors.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and procedures are updated when a change is made. \n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.7    Pre-Startup Review\n\n\n\nPrior to starting up any new covered process or modified covered process, Rayonier performs a pre-startup safety review when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any highly hazardous chemical into a new or modified process.  This review is done before startup to verify that safety issues have been addressed.
