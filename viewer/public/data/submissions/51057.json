The KSC Emergency Operations Center and Brevard County Emergency Operations Center jointly monitor the same emergency frequencies.    \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIn addition to complying with the PSM Standard, NASA, as well as the two contractors overseeing the operations at LC-39 A and B and FSA-1 (USA and SGS) have implemented OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) at KSC.  VPP is a cooperative effort that goes beyond the requirements of general OSHA compliance.  To this end, KSC has a commitment in writing to VPP and to continually improve KSC's overal safety and health programs."

      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is the major NASA installation for launch operations and related programs in support of manned space missions.  The KSC core business is to provide space system processes, test, and launch techniques and to develop associated technologies. KSC spans approximately 220 square miles of the east central coast of Florida; a very small part of this acreage is designated for NASA operational and industrial use.  Because Merritt Island was found to include prime habitat for unique and endangered wildlife, NASA entered into an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to establish a wildlife preserve, known as the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR) within the boundaries of KSC.  Additionally, an agreement with the Department of the Interior (USDI) resulted in most of the Canaveral National Seashore (CNS) to fall with in KSC boundaries.  \nThe day-to-day operation of KSC is managed by NASA KSC personnel with support provided by contractors.  Contractors United Space Alliance (USA) and Space Gateway Support (SGS) operate three separate processes with monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) over the RMP threshold amount of 15,000 pounds.  MMH is a hypergol fuel used in shuttle orbiter\u00bfs Reaction Control System (RCS) and Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS).  Hypergolic fuels ignite when combined with their oxidizers.  MMH is delivered to KSC in tankers and stored at Fuel Storage Area (FSA) #1 at the Cape Canaveral Air Station (CCAS).  Although located at CCAS, FSA #1 is controlled by NASA.  As needed, MMH is transferred to Launch Complex (LC) 39 A or B.  The LC-39 A and B processes have identical configurations and are located on NASA property.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nTwo of KSC\u00bfs four guiding principles are \u00bfSafety and Health First\u00bf and \u00bfEnvironmental Leadership.\u00bf  Because the MMH processes described also exceed the threshold quantity"

      "SummaryText": "for OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, they are subject to those requirements as well.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the three MMH processes in the Program 3 level.  KSC will use its PSM programs as the required Program 3 Prevention Programs.  The PSM Program at KSC has been developed to minimize the potential for fires, explosions, and accidental releases and receives full support of management and requires involvement of employees at all levels.  The PSM program helps to prevent chemical accidents from occurring and ensures that facility operations remain safe for work team members and the public.  The program is based on the principle that facilities will remain safe provided they are designed and upgraded according to sound engineering practices; built, operated, and maintained properly; and periodically reviewed for conformance to the elements of the PSM program.  \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNASA KSC has had no accidental releases of MMH in the past five years that resulted in injuries, deaths, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nKSC has developed a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) that is coordinated with all response elements, both on Center and Brevard County Emergency Management.  This includes the State Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This plan provides the guidelines for KSC\u00bfs Emergency Preparedness Program and is designed to be supplemented by other emergency plans and procedures.  KSC employs full time law enforcement, medical, emergency management, and hazardous materials emergency response technicians.  \n\nTo validate the CEMP, tabletop, functional and full-scale exercises are conducted on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis.  The emergency preparedness program is managed by a Certified Emergency Manager"
