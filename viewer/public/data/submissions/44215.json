All written programs and MSDS sheets are maintained at the plant and are available to all employees.  All WWTP operating personnel are trained on the proper handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks and feed systems, and emergencyresponse contact policies.  An outside agency (Connersville Fire Department) is to be notified in the event of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide outside the aility.  The Fire department will be responsible for any necessary notifications of trained or equiped hazardous materials responders and/or the public.\n\n2.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION:  This facility is a Class III standard activated sludge wastewater treatment plant located in Connersville, Indiana.  The WWTP uses chlorine contact for disinfection of plant effluent and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination before discharge to the West Fork of the Whitewater River.During the months of April through October, the plant draws chlorine and sulfur dioxide from tanks using a low pressure water induction system.  No more than three (3) 2,000 pound tanks of chlorine are on hand at any time for a maximum quantity of 6,000 pounds.  No more than two (2) 2,000 pound tanks of sulfur dioxide are on hand at any time, for a maximum quantity of 4,000 pounds.\n                                                                                                                                                                                       3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: The accidental release prevention program is based upon a combination of management practices and low pressure vacuum feeders specifically designed for chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases.\n                                                                                                                              "

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The Connersville WWTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years.\n\n5.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  Connersville WWTP has an Emergency Response Plan that represents a common sense approach to emergencies that contains a combination of previously written strategies and current safety practices.  However, response activities will be handled by public responders.  Emergency issues have been coordinated with the Connersville Fire Department and the Fayette County Office of Emergency Management.\n\n6. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Connersville Utilities will continue to emphasize employee training."
