A methodical procedure termed as Job Safety Analysis (JSA) for ensuring that the proper precautions are in place prior to undertaking any non-routine tasks.\r\n\r\nThese safe work practices and procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system designed to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely at all times.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Dewitt Central Delivery Point promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire or explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and underlying cause(s) of the incident to develop corrective actions and implement steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident and prevent similar incidents.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent similar incidents, and forwards these results to management for further action. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are fully implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the Risk Management Program is functioning properly, the Dewitt Central Deliv"

      "SummaryText": "itt Central Delivery Point has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the facility's operations and processes are identified and minimized.  This is a systematic procedure in which each part of the process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards associated with the process, and to ensure that appropriate recommendations are developed and implemented to eliminate or control the potential hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis procedure utilized at the Dewitt Central Delivery Point is carried out by a team of functional experts from engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety, who work with a PHA Facilitator to identify and evaluate all of the potential hazards that could possibly result in a release of a regulated substance.  The team also evaluates potential mitigation measures and accident prevention measures for each potential process hazard at the facility.  The final part of the procedure requires the team to make specific suggestions for management consideration to address or mitigate each identified hazard.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team's findings and suggestions are provided to facility management for further evaluation and resolution.  All approved mitigation options are then tracked as part of the process until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted within 5 year intervals and will continue at this frequency as long as the facility is in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Dewitt Central Deliv"

These data and documents include written data and engineering drawings on the design of the facility, the chemistry of the process and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within the gas facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nSafety data are maintained for all chemicals that are used, handled, or produced at the facility.  This data includes permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and corrosive information, thermal and chemical stability, toxicity data (if applicable), personal protective equipment, and measures to be taken in the event of physical contact or airborne exposure to a chemical.  This information is maintained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), as part of the Hazard Communication Program at the facility.  \r\n\r\nFor specific process areas, the facility has documented the safe operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.).  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automatic shutdown systems.\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes design flow rates, fluid properties, pressures and temperatures that were the basis of the sizing of the different subsystems or individual pieces of equipment.  The information on the process design also includes the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.

In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the facility, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator, as a mentor, to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through peer review and skills demonstration) the knowledge level needed to perform their duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, then and only then, will they be allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Dewitt Central Delivery Point uses contractors to perform many project-specific activities and supplement the facility workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction periods.  \r\n\r\nFor those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place, that when followed, ensure that these contractors:\r\n\r\n* Will perform their work in a safe manner.\r\n* Have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process.\r\n* Are aware of the hazards in their workplace.\r\n* Have an understanding of what they should do in the event of an incident.\r\n* Have an understanding of and follow site safety rules.\r\n* Will inform gas facility personnel of any hazards that their work brings and/or that they find during their work."
