The site utilizes a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA)methodology in the most recent Hazard Studies.   The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel which may include expertise in engineering, process operations, maintenance and environmental, health and safety.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are entered in our electronic tracking system.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,  we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to workers involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAxiall Corporation  has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently at intervals determined by the complexity of the process and employee input.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nAxiall Corporation carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification prior to working with the modified process.  In addition operating procedures and associated PSI are updated as required.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at  Axiall Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nAxiall Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. All incidents are inputted electronically on our electronic tracking system. These incidents are shared and provide a tool for lessons learned throughout the corporation. We use the Apollo Root Cause methodology to investigate all incidents that meet the company's set criteria.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nWe believe that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. Axiall developed a Safety Involvement team (SIT) and a Unit Safety Involvement Team (USIT) to increase employee involvement. Both teams provide value in Employee Participation. They focus on updating safety procedures, plant inspections, unit and plant safety issues and they are a voice to Management concerning plant safety issues.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.   Axiall Corporation, Plaquemine Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n \r\n4.Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nAxiall Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases;  during the 5 years prior to the Feb 2015 submission, there have not been accidents in our site that meet the RMP criteria as defined in \u00a768.42.  \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nAxiall Corporation has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.
