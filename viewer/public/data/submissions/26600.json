If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.

In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guidelines in the ANSI Standards. The repair of valves and pumps is done by an outside professional contractor.  \n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually,  whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulaions is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos and on the job training.  Topics covered in this training includes; safety, operating procedures for plant startup, plant shutdowns, filling a nurse tank, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown ans startup after emergency shutdown.\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred at this location.\n\n6.The Emergency Response Program.    \n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.   In preparation for this, we have coordinated with the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared "
