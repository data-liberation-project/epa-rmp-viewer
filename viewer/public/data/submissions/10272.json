By June 21, 1999, we also plan to be in compliance with NFPA-58, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Houston County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled:  The LaRue #1 is the site of an oil and gas production well equipped with a refrigeration gas plant to extract natural gas liquids from the natural gas prior to the gas entering a sales pipeline.  The natural gas extracted from the well passes through a refrigeration unit where the natural gas is chilled to below freezing temperatures.  The gas then enters a separator which allows the natural gas liquids to drop out of the gasand accumulate in a separator.  The liquids (flammable mixture) are then dumped under pressure to a single 12,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel.  The liquids are stored in this vessel until a sufficient quantity has accumulated inside the vessel to conduct a sale.  The natural gas liquids are removed from the site by use of transport trucks. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-case scenario is the failure of the 12,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel when filled to capacity, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the flammable mixture stored in the vessel.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and one public receptor is within the distance to the endpoint.  The worst-case scenarios did not take into account any active or passive mitigation scenarios.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter loading hose leading to a 15-minute release of a flammable mixture (13,659 lbs.) and an explosion.  Ac"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite but no public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidential release program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  The storage vessel and gas plant are also operated in compliance with the Texas Railroad CommissionStatewide rule 61 covering the operation of gasoline plants in the State of Texas.  We are currently in the process of upgrading the facility so that it will meet the standards provided in NFPA-58.  This upgrade is anticipated to be completed by June 21, 1999.\n\nFive year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving a mixture of flammable liquids that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our pressurized storage vessel and refrigeration unit, it is our policy to notify the Houston County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Houston County Fire Marshall.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  A hazard review was performed at this facility on March 24, 1999.  The following changes are planned to improve safety at the facility:\n\n1)  Place a wind sock at the facility for indication of wind direction in case of release;\n2)  Remove all dead vegetation and wood pallets from around the pressurized storage vessel;\n3)  Identify contents stored inside the pressurized vessel (i.e., Natral Gas Liquids);\n4)  Place NFPA diamonds on the pressurized storage vessel;\n5)  Replace loading hose.  the hose should be marked \"For LP-Gas Service - Working Pressure 350 psi - Manufacturer's Name\" and ledgible along full length of the hose.\n6)  Provide housing/storage for the hose to prevent weathering;\n7)  Cap end of hose when not in"
