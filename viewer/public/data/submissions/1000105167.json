This will allow the site to grow and implement more automation which will reduce the element of human factor errors for the storage and transfer of Regulated Substances. This will also reduce the storage footprint and consolidate the storage of Regulated Substances into one location. The spill containment capacity will be 110% of the largest tank in the tank farm.\n2. VRC will add a scrubber to control emissions of Regulated Substance Storage. \n \nVRC Technologies Health, Safety, and Environmental Polic"
