Mechanical compression and heat exchange cycles occur within the interconnected piping and equipment.  The elements of process safety management are implemented to assure the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.  \n\nPrimary safeguards include ammonia detection and machinery room emergency ventilation.   The PSM/RMP prevention program is managed by facility staff to assure system equipment safeguards and industry standards are met to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Mechanical Integrity of the process equipment is maintained through inspections, routine testing and appropriate levels of operator training.  Refrigeration system operators and contractors receive training for safe work practices to prevent all releases, or stop them small in instance when incidental releases might occur. \n\n",

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n    To save lives.\n\n    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n    To protect the environment.\n\n    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmeriCold maintains an emergency safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\n    The AmeriCold York (Plant #2253) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Ty"
