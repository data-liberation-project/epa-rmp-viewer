This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n    To save lives.\n\n    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n    To protect the environment.\n\n    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nAmeriCold maintains an emergency safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\n    The AmeriCold York (Plant #2253) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Ty"

No injuries or hospitalizations occurred.  The facility evacuated 4 employees and the fire dept responded.  The total amount released was 311 punds, due to a faulty Safety Relief Valve.  The valve was replaced for a like in kind.  Incident investigation was conducted and kept.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe AmeriCold York WSL (Plant #2253) has an Emergency Action/Response Program in place.  The facility does not have an Emergency Response Team; however, key refrigeration maintenance personnel is trained to the technicial level of Haz Mat on an annual basis.  Key personnel will serve as a resource to local emergency response team.  All haz mat technician level trained personnel receive fit testing and med"

These action items were included into a management plan and have been addressed.\n\n"
