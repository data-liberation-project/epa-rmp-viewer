EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Texas City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  For example, as a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care  .  to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Texas City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Texas City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Texas City Plant.\n\n1.1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Texas City Plant is committed to the safety of Texas City Plant workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Texas City Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Texas City Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, contacts the Texas City fire department to alert the local industrial mutual aid society (IMAS)  "

      "SummaryText": "to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  Texas City Plant, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\nThe Texas City Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at company facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Plant Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Plant Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Plant Manager's staff. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the plant Technical Services Manager.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the plant Technical Services Manager.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Plant Safety Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2 The ISP Texas City Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe ISP Texas City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in Texas City, Texas. Chemicals manufacturing commenced on this 330 acre site in 1967. ISP Texas City employs approximately 150 hourly and salaried personnel. We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: methanol, formaldehyde, ammonia, acetylene, butanediol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, propyl acetate, vinyl pyrrolidine, vinyl acetate, and propane. The ISP Texas City Plant makes a variety of products:  butyrolactone, 2-py"

Some of these feed materials and products are toxic or flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.  In total, we have six (6) process units that are covered by the RMP rule. The following are the RMP substances we handle in covered processes: acetylene, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, methylamine, propane, and vinyl acetate.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nTexas City Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternate case scenarios.  The Texas City Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Texas City Plant.  Alternate case scenarios can be used to help the improve the community emergency response plan.  We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  If you are interested in this information, please contact our Technical Services Department at (409) 945-3411.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\nWhen considering explosion of a flammable substance, people at the endpoint distance are likely to be knocked down by the blast.  Windows could shatter, and the potential for structural damage to buildings exists, although a building coll"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Texas City Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their Process Operating Manuals.  The Texas City Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe Texas City Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Texas City Plant has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Texas City Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.

New or transferred employees receive basic training in Texas City Plant operations. The new or transferred employee is then given classroom training on  the unit(s) to which they will be assigned. After successfully completing this training, a new operator begins the second phase of training, on-the-job training (OJT). This training consists of hands on training coupled with evaluations of both actual in the field evaluation of knowledge and skills and written evaluations of knowledge and skills. During OJT the new or transferred employee is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Texas City Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
