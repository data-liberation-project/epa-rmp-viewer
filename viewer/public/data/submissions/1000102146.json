The 2022 MI Audit and the 2022 PHA Update identified several areas where process improvements could improve the safety of the facility, including repair of damaged insulation, performance of non-destructive testing, replacement of system piping, updating of the existing preventative maintenance plan."

PM is performed in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases; the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by CS Storage Foods exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at two locations and are tested semi-annually. Relief valves are replaced by an ASME certified agent on a five-year schedule.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the last five years there have been no federal reportable releases that caused death, injury, hospitalization or property damage. \nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in process and perimeter locations.  A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.  The ammonia sensors are tested semi-annually.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm system auto-dialer is also activated if ammonia is detected.\n\nIn the event of a process release, the alarm system auto-dialer calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the Middleborough Department if any of the following conditions are present:\n- Upon investigating the incident, CS Storage Foods determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance; Re"

The ammonia refrigeration process at CS Storage \u2013 Middleborough Facility has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. CS Storage has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule.\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Contingency Plan) as required under OSHA PSM, CS Storage has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nCS Storage is a freezer warehouse facility primarily engaged in the storage of frozen foods.  The facility is a 150,530 sq. ft. Industrially zoned facility with a maximum inventory capacity of 20,037 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As CS Storage anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at CS Storage is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions, and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards Institute / Amer"
