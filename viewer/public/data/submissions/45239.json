This facility conforms to the laws and regulations of the state of Missouri.  Our emergency response policy involves our cooperation with community response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  Storage tanks, nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility?s anhydrous ammonia operation.  Though facility is manned through out the year, the ammonia is sold to farmers only during spring and fall use seasons.  The facility operates with normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as ?worst-case? release and ?alternative? release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe results of the above off-site consequences analysis have been pulled from the executive summary but can be found in Sections 2.0 and 3.0 of the Risk Management Plan.  These analysis have been documented in the facilities Risk Management Program.\n\nChula Farmers Coop has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years.  Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nChula Farmers Coop "

Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3.  Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4.  Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5.  Annual inspections include safety equipment, tanks and handling equipment.\n6.  Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safey to the operators and to the community."
