The products covered by EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) at this site are:\n\n?    Chlorine: used to packaging smaller containers of chlorine and to manufacturing bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Chlorine (and sodium hypochlorite) are well-known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, wastewater, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc.\n\n?    Sulfur dioxide: used to make paper and by water treatment facilities to purify water (warehousing only at this location)\n\n?    Anhydrous Ammonia: used in refrigeration systems (warehousing only at this location)\n\n?    Aqua Ammonia conc. 20% or greater: bulk storage and distribution.  Aqua ammonia is used for NOx emission control and potable water treatment. \n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nPrevention Program:  Planning for accidents, such as that done through our Risk Management Plan helps to ensure that they never happen.

In addition to our internal efforts, safety and emergency response planning also is coordinated with local and national officials, including the St. Paul Fire Department, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard.  Hawkins also must regularly meet requirements in industrial wastewater, national pollutant discharge (NPDES) and other permits, and is an active member of the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\"\n\n"
