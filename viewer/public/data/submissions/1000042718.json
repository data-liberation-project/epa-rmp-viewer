PSI is updated through the Management of Change Program, as are the operating specifications.  The entire system is audited every three years.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Plant uses some or all of the hazard evaluation techniques outlined in the American Institute of Chemical Engineers publication Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures to perform these evaluations.   The analyses are conducted using a team with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include employees with expertise in the following areas: technical, staff engineering, operations, maintenance, safety, and PHA methodology.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  All PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team updates and revalidates each PHA every five years.  These periodic reviews are conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations,"

As part of this commitment, Firestone has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of the Lake Charles Plant.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Program (the RMP rule) and OSHA's 29 CFR part 1910.119 (the PSM rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide interested parties with a description of the risk management program at the Plant.  \r\n\r\nFirestone is an active participant in the community.  The Lake Charles Plant is voluntarily involved in the Calcasieu Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The Lake Charles Plant is also an active member of the Lake Area Industry/McNeese Engineering Partnership (LAI/MEP), the Safety Council of Southwest Louisiana, Mutual Aid of Southwest Louisiana, Calcasieu Area Emergency Response (CAER), and the Calcasieu Parish Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nOver the past five years the Lake Charles Plant has received several corporate pollution prevention awards and Bridgestone/Firestone corporate safety awards for 15%, 30% and 35% improvements in safety performance.\r\n\r\nFirestone is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The Plant produces a wide range of synthetic rubber products manufactured by the solution polymerization process.\r\nTwo flammable substances and one toxic substance are covered under the Accidental Release Program (ARP).  The two flammable substances are 1, 3-butadiene and 2-butene-cis.  The toxic substance is boron trifluoride.\r\n\r\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO FLAMMABLE\r\n\r\nThe flammable on site is 1, 3 Butadiene.  A release of 923,728 pounds using RMPComp32 calculated an endpoint of 0.8 miles.  The alternate flammable scenario was the release of 1,3 Butadiene through a 3/4 inch piping failure at 73 degrees F and a pressure of 250 psi.  RMPComp32 calculated the release of 3,840 pounds to an endpoint of 0.08 mile.\r\n\r\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIO TOXIC\r\n\r\nThe toxic on site is boron triflouride.  A release of 26,250 pounds using RMPComp32 calculated an endpoint of 6.8 miles.  The alternate toxic scenario was the release of 1750 pounds of boron triflouride at 175 pounds per minute over a 10 minute period for a total of 1750 pounds.

The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. \r\n\r\nNew employees receive immediate training in the following areas of the process: overview of process; process fundamentals; and process description.  Training includes emphasis on specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  This training must be passed through oral or written testing and the employee must demonstrate and verify that they understand the required operating procedures before they are allowed to operate the unit alone.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  This refresher training on the operating procedures is to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Additionally, more frequent training will occur upon the request of the employee.  The appropriate frequency of training is decided by management"

There has been no RMP defined incident involving a regulated substance.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Lake Charles Plant addresses personnel, planning, resources, communications and alliances.  Firestone has an emergency response team consisting of employees representing various units in the plant.  This team has been trained in hazardous materials, confined-space rescue and medical training.\r\n\r\nPlanning has been developed in coordination with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and Mutual Aid as well as neighboring companies and communities.  The Plant has the resources to respond to emergencies immediately; these include equipment, materials and additional labor.  Fire water pumps, dry chemicals, foam, emergency vehicles, rescue equipment, spill control/cleanup material and water are available on-site for immediate use.

The purpose of this system is to ensure that process changes maintain or enhance the safety, environmental, and technical integrity originally designed into the Plant.  This system requires that changes to items such as chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  \r\n\r\nPrior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor employees, are notified and provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. \r\n\r\nThe investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident.  The team develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards this report to the plant management team for resolution.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA rev"
