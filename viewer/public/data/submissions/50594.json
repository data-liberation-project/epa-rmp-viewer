      "SummaryText": "I.   Approach to Prevention of Accidental Releases\n\nSt. Jude Medical, Inc. - Woodridge Technology Center (SJM) has adopted a comprehensive, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  SJM has incorporated applicable codes related to engineering and safe handling of hazardous materials, continuous training of operators and support staff, and best safety management practices.  SJM has a comprehensive emergency response plan which includes onsite emergency coordinators and coordination with the local fire department.   \n\nSJM qualifies for Program 3 requirements for use of methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) under the EPA Risk Management Program.  This material is used in the manufacture of mechanical heart valves.  SJM has previously implemented a process safety management program to prevent unplanned releases of  MTCS.  The SJM Risk Management Plan (RMP) refers to the process safety management plan for information on process hazards and prevention related to MTCS. \n\nII.  Sources and Hazardous Materials \n\nSJM has one process which qualifies for EPA Risk Management Program requirements.  The SJM coating process uses MTCS, which is a toxic and flammable liquid, and is contained in DOT specification containers of 1,000 pounds each during storage and use.  \n\nIII.  SJM Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSince SJM has already qualified for the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements for MTCS, it has already established a process safety program for the coating process.  Key elements include: hardware and controls installed according to required codes and best engineering practices, gas monitoring system, process gas scrubber system, process hazard analysis completed for the coating process, and updates have been completed for any changes in the process, written operator procedures and annual training for each facet of the coating process according to FDA requirements, comprehensive preventive maintenance program for all process and support e"

      "SummaryText": "quipment associated the with coating process, internal engineering change procedures as required by FDA and ISO 9000 requirements, pre-startup safety review by Facilities, Quality and Coating Departments on all new process equipment used in coating, employee participation in development of safety information, hazard review, and development and updating of coating procedures, accident investigation procedures, training of contractors who work on the coating process equipment in potential hazards, use of a work authorization system for contractors working near chemical hazards, and welding/hot work permit system.\n\nIV.  Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases of MTCS have occurred within the last 5 years.\n\nV.  Emergency Response Procedures\n\nSJM has developed an emergency procedures manual which is distributed to all employees.  The manual covers response to chemical spills, fires, and medical emergencies.  Employees receive annual training in emergency response and evacuation procedures including recognition of gas system alarms and appropriate response.  The Little Canada Fire Department has reviewed these emergency procedures.  SJM has onsite Emergency Coordinators who are trained to assess response situations and initiate response procedures such as shutoff of emergency systems and summoning of outside emergency responders.  These personnel carry cell phones during the workday and after scheduled work hours.    \n\nVI.  Planned Safety Improvements\n\nA process hazard analyses was originally completed in October 1997 for the bulk gas system featuring MTCS and reviewed again in February 2003.  Six recommendations were identified for consideration in 2003 and all recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as determined necessary.  SJM has also hired a full time safety and environmental engineer.  SJM continues to train employees in chemical safety and emergency response procedures annually."
