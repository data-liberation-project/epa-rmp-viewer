Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \nrefrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related \ndairy products.  It is a closed system that contains 15,000 \npounds of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated \nvapor) when fully charged.  The largest vessel is the high pressure \nreceiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much \nas 11,760 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum fill volume of \napproximately 75%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel \ncontains about 3,000 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia \nequipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some \npiping runs are located outdoors.  The Battle Creek plant is located in a \nrural setting.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Battle Creek plant is \na single-stage system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side and a \nsuction side.  Three screw compressors and one reciprocating compressor \ndraw suction from the suction accumulator (trap) at about 25 psig.  This \naccumulator receives suction gas from the ice water chiller, cooler units, \nglycol chillers, and refrigerated tanks and silos. Ammonia liquid which \ncollects in the accumulator is returned to the liquid line by a pumper \ndrum.  The major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) \nenters a roof-mounted condenser.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for \ndefrosting and for operation of the pumper drum.  The condensed liquid \nis returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigerati"

      "SummaryText": "on \nequipment.\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration \nsystem.   These include pressure relief valves and safety interlocks.  \nPressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, \npumper drum, suction accumulators and other pressure vessels, and \nsuction lines from overpressurization.  Safety interlocks include high \npressure, low pressure, and oil pressure cut-outs for the compressors, as \nwell as high level floats for the accumulator.  The high level float turns off \nthe king valve to reduce the amount of liquid going to the system, sounds \nan alarm in the control room and shuts off the compressors.  The high \npressure cut-out for each compressor is set 190 to 200 psig.\n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases \nof ammonia. To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \nstandard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components \nof the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n    The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical \nprocess safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the \ndesign basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is \nused to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration \nsystem.\n\n    The development of an extensive employee participation program, \nwhich includes employees from all levels of the organization and from \nall areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This \nprogram also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system \nand are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, \neffectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which \nenhance safety.\n\n    The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \n\"What-if...\" technique.

The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five \nyears.\n\n    Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the \nbasis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration \nsystem.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, \nshutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They \nalso describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the \nconsequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a \ndescription of safety systems and how they operate. \n\n    Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, \npre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes \nor expansions are as safe as the original design and that an \nindependent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are \nconsistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \n\n3.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last \nfive years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage \non-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property \ndamage, or environmental damage.\n\n4.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan \n(EAP).
