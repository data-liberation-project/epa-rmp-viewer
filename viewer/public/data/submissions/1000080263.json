Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nThe Thermosyphon Tank receives liquid ammonia from the condensers; it provides liquid ammonia to the High Pressure Receiver. The Thermosyphon Tank also provides liquid ammonia to all Compressor Oil Coolers. The High Pressure Receiver provides liquid ammonia to the +5?F Intercooler and the Glycol Chiller. The +5?F Intercooler provides liquid ammonia to the produce, dairy, meat, banana rooms, floral, seafood, milk, and dock area via liquid pumps. The +5?F Intercooler also feeds subcooled liquid to the -35?F Low Temp Recirculator. The -35?F Low Temperature Recirculator provides liquid ammonia to the 0?F and -20?F f"

The -35?F Low Temperature Recirculator pumps liquid ammonia to the 0?F and -20?F Freezer evaporators. The -35?F Low Temperature Recirculator also collects the liquid/vapor mixture from these evaporators; the vapor returned is then drawn to the booster compressors. \n\n\n\nThe +5?F Intercooler pumps liquid ammonia to the produce, dairy, meat, banana rooms, floral, seafood, milk, and dock area evaporators. The +5?F Intercooler also collects the liquid/vapor mixture from these evaporators; the vapor returned is then drawn to the high stage compressors.\n\nThere are two Freezer Air Curtains that provide an air curtain of downward flow air to hold the colder temperature within the freezer when the freezer doorway is opened, to prevent the warmer temperature from entering the freezer and causing unsafe icing conditions due to condensation freezing, and to prevent freeze-up of the doorway area while loading and unloading operations are in progress. Hot Gas is supplied to the air curtain. Boil-off condensate created by the hot gas and the 0? colder temperature from the freezer is returned to the high temperature recirculated suction line and back to +5?F Intercooler.\n\n\n\nThe Glycol Chiller is used to transfer heat from the glycol to the ammonia for the Banana Rooms. The Glycol Chiller utilizes high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver.  This high pressure liquid is expanded in the shell and tube section of the Glycol Chiller where it absorbs heat from the glycol that passes through the tubes.  As the ammonia absorbs heat it boils and collects in the Glycol Chiller surge drum mounted on top of the shell and tube section.  Glycol is chilled to a preset temperature by controlling the pressure in the surge drum through a pressure regulating valve where ammonia f"

During the compression phase in the compressor, the temperature of the ammonia vapor rises and the pressure of the ammonia vapor increases. The low pressure booster discharge flows from the compressors via a vapor head to the +5?F Intercooler.\n\n\n\nThe high stage compressors (HSC-1 thru HSC-5) draw the suction return vapor that is collected in the +5?F Intercooler and compresses it to discharge high pressure vapor (hot gas). The compressors are the primary energy input into the system. Hot gas is used internally within the system to assist with defrosting the evaporator coils based on a timed cycle. The main high stage discharge flow is routed to the Condensers, which discharge the latent heat in the ammonia to the atmosphere using sprayed water and fans, resulting in high pressure liquid ammonia. This liquid is recycled into the Thermosyphon Tank. \n\n\n\nThere is an automatic purger located in the Engine Room. The Auto Purger provides a means to automatically remove foul gas from the system. In Automatic mode, the purger will sequence through the purge points condensing ammonia vapor in the purger chamber and purging any foul gas from the system.

The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Baldwin's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the freezer warehouse that will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection in those locations.
