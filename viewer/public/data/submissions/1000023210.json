      "SummaryText": "Golden Hammer, LLC owns the Pilot Goldsmith Plant.  The plant is operated by Pilot Energy Solutions, LLC (Pilot). The Pilot Goldsmith Plant is a newly constructed facility that will receive production from area oil and gas wells via flowline. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate upstream of the plant. The gas in the plant is processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change which condenses hydrocarbons, propane +, to condense forming a propane + (LPG) product. The LPG product is stored in pressurized bullet tanks with maximum volume of 30,000 gallons each and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon LPG tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Pilot Goldsmith Plant. The 30,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles. No public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the LPG tanks. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Pilot Goldsmith Plant is located in a remote area and is normally occupied by Pilot personnel.\n\n\n\nSince the facility is newly constructed, there is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Pilot Goldsmith Plant LPG system occur, it is Pilot's policy to notify the Goldsmith Volunteer Fire Department (or first available department through the 911 dispatch system) and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the local fire chief in Goldsmith, TX.\n\n"
