All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\nTraining:  Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all inspections.  Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n\nManagement of Change:  A written procedure developed and followed to manage changes (except for replacement in kind) to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the chlorine system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:  Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n\nCompliance Audits:  Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n\t\nIncident Investigation:  Stringent investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine release.\n\nEmployee Participation:  Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM program"

The operators report that the valve remained open for approximately twelve (12) seconds before the supply valve was closed and the release was contained. Gas alarms in the area registered the chlorine concentration of the room to be above 1 ppm and triggered the automatic shutdown of the chlorine injection system and emergency action procedures for evacuation were initiated. First responders were notified of the incident at approximately 9:25 AM, and the release was reported to the San Bernardino County\u2019s Office of Fire Marshal \u2013 Hazardous Material Division, and the Office of Emergency Operations who supplied an OES Control NO. 22-2079. Approximately 3.4 pounds of chlorine were released during the incident and one operator was transported to the Redlands Community Hospital by responding ambulances. An incident investigation was conducted by the City of Redlands. The investigation determined that the root cause of the incident was improper implementation of procedures by personnel who failed to conduct steps prior to opening interior gas supply valve. Corrective actions taken as a result of the incident investigation include refresher training for affected staff, updates to emergency notification to include emergency response notification procedures beyond that of the initial notifications, and revisions to the Chlorine Gas Record Form to include areas to document that operating procedure were reviewed and operator roles established prior to proceeding with chlorine gas tank exchange.\n\nFurther details associated with these incidents such as atmospheric conditions during incidents are available in the Incident Investigation Reports compiled in the Incident Investigation sections of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Compliance Workbook.\n\nPROCE"

The senior Operator noted that the valve yoke adapter was faulty and replaced the equipment to successfully complete the connection. No injuries or casualties were reported. The chlorine leak was reported to Supervisors Pete Garcia and Paul Mariscal who conducted an investigation. The investigation reports that operators were donning PPE and utilizing buddy system for procedure, the cause of the broken valve yoke adapter was noted as the cause of the near miss and lack of operator experience resulted in failure to notice the faulty valve yoke adapter. The resulting action from the investigation included refresher training for all operations staff and annual practice on training cylinder which was to be observed by senior operations personnel.\n\nA near miss occurred on May 15, 2020, at approximately 9:00 AM, as Water Treatment Operators from the City of Redlands were conducting a routine task of changing out a 1-ton chlorine gas cylinder at the Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant. The cylinder was exchanged, and a leak test was conducted on the new cylinder. The result of the leak test was operators noticing a leak of chlorine coming from the lead gasket of the cylinder. The senior Operator noted that the valve yoke adapter was damaged and replaced the faulty equipment to successfully complete the connection. No injuries or casualties were reported. The chlorine leak was reported to Supervisors, Pete Garcia Paul Mariscal, and Shannon Simmers who conducted an investigation. No off-site responders were notified of this incident. The investigation reports the cause of the near miss as failure by personnel to properly inspect all equipment prior to the commencement of a tank exchange. The resulting action from the investigation included additional training on the inspection of equipment and devices during tank exchange"

      "SummaryText": "FACILITY: CITY OF REDLANDS HENRY TATE WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing two reactor-type clarifiers (that provide flocculation and sedimentation) and four dual media gravity filters. The plant's raw water source is Mill Creek. Water from the after bay of the Edison Mill Creek #1 Powerhouse travels via pipeline to the Cooley Hat where it is delivered to the influent of the Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant.  The untreated or raw water entering the plant contains sand; suspended particles; and microorganisms; collectively referred to as turbidity, that must be removed before the water enters the distribution system.  The basic treatment processes include a sand chamber, flocculation basins, sedimentation basins, and filters.  Polymers and other chemicals are added at various points to condition and treat the water.  Chlorine gas is added for water disinfection. Chlorine gas is a regulated substance subject to the federal RMP requirements.\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant uses the following chemical that is stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nChlorine - One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier. A maximum of four (4) one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a ventilated building.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\nThe HTWTP has had three (3) accidents that were identified as two (2) near misses and one (1) accidental release associated with the chlorine injection system in the past five (5) years.\n\nA near miss occurred on May 15, 2019, at approximately 10:00 AM, as Water Treatment Operators from the City of Redlands were conducting a routine task of changing out a 1-ton chlorine gas cylinder at the Henry Tate Water Treatment Plant. The cylinder was exchanged, and a le"
