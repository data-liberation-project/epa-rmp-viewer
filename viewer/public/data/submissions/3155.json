Exhaust fans blow out of room away from personnel to eliminate potential exposure during venting.  Louvers also open on south wall of machine room to provide cross flow during the ventilation sequence.\n*  High and low level switches are installed on all pressure vessels (excluding oil pots) to alert refrigeration personnel of any deviations from normal operating conditions within that particular vessel, or the refrigeration system as a whole. \n*  Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and oil separators to eliminate possible over pressurization conditions within those associated pieces of equipment and throughout the system.\n*  Refrigeration operators make rounds every four (4) hours and log equipment status to track system performance.  \n*  Production operates 6:00 am - 12:00 pm, with fire watch/security trained personnel on duty to cover the off shift hours as well as  holidays.  During off shift hours a refrigeration tech is on call for securtiy to notify in case of an emergency.\n*  Periodic maintenance program is in place to ensure the entire refrigeration system is maintained in optimum operational and mechanical condition at all times.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices\n\nThis Bright Harvest Sweet Potato Company manufacturing site complies with applicable federal,\nstate and local regulations.  This food processing facility has a formal worker safety program.  All\nemployees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially\nhazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has\nprocedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous\nsubstance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response\nprocedures.\n\n2.   Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThis food processing facility is located at I-40 Exit 58, Clarksville, Arkansas.  Frozen prepared\nfoods are produced at this location.  Raw vegetables are received, washed, peeled, cooked,\nmixed, formed, frozen and packaged.  The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous\nammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.\n\n3.   Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia from the largest vessel over a period\nof ten minutes.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the vessel is limited to 80-percent of the\ntotal volume of 11,050 pounds via written administrative controls, resulting in a release of\napproximately 8,800 pounds of ammonia.  There are off-site impacts under this worst-case\nscenario.\n\nThe alternate-case scenario consists of the release of ammonia vapor from a safety relief valve due\nto an overpressure condition in a vessel located in the facility s machine room"

      "SummaryText": ".  The relief valve is\ndesigned to vent ammonia to the atmosphere when its pressure rating is exceeded, preventing\npotential damage to other components in the refrigeration system.  The scenario results in a 172-\npound ammonia release over a period of 11 minutes.  There are off-site impacts under the\nalternate-case scenario.\n\n4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThis Bright Harvest Sweet Potato Company manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA\nProcess Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to\nanhydrous ammonia.  Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and\nmaintenance of the ammonia   refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have\nbeen trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good\nengineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia\ndetection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room,\nhigh- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious system\noverpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system is ensured via the use of a\ncomputerized maintenance management system.  Annual physical system audits are performed by\nan external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity. \n\n5.   Five Year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years this facility has had one release that resulted in an offsite evacuation. \nThe evacuation was performed as a precautionary measure.\n\n6.   Emergency Response Program\n\nAt this facility the primary emphasis is to safely evacuate all employees in the event of an\naccidental release, pursuant to the requirements of OSHA 1910.38 (a).  Coordination with the\nlocal fire department and LEPC is initiated during an emergency situation."
