THIS COMPANY STRIVES TO MAINTAIN A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK PLACE.  OUR FARMER OWNERS, MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PLAN THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nOUR PLANT CONSIST OF 1-30,000 AND 1-12,000 GALLON ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS  AND WHEN FILLED TO 85% CAPACITY WILL HOLD APPROXIMATELY 185,000 POUNDS.  THE NURSE TANKS ARE FILLED ON SITE BUT MOVED TO SEPARATE LOCATIONS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO MAY POTENTIALLY RELEASE 132,000 POUNDS (OVER A TEN MINUTE PERIOD) AND HAS A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.50 MILES.  THIS RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 50 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A RELEASE OF 11,908 POUNDS OVER A 2\u00bfMINUTE RELEASE PERIOD.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES AND WOULD STILL AFFECT 5 PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THE COLORADO  DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT.  THOSE CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE ACTED UPON IMMEDIATELY TO REDUCE POTENTIAL AMMONIA RELEASES.  OUR PLANS ARE AT THIS TIME INCLUDE ADDING EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF CONTROLS  ON ALL PLANTS, BUT MAYBE PROHIBITED BY BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS.\n\nOUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY PROCEDURES, PROPER PLANT OPERATION, PLANT MAINTENANCE AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE COMPETENCY TESTED OVER THE TRAINING MATERIAL.  EACH EMPLOYEE USES GOGGLES AND GLOVES DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS AS WELL AS ALWAYS PROVIDING PLENTY OF SAFETY WATER DURING NURSE TANK LOADING OPERATIONS. \n\nWITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRAINING IN MIND, IT MAKES IT VERY SIMPLE TO REPORT TO YOU THAT ABSOLUTELY NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS FACILITY FOR THE PAST FIVE YEAR"
