THIS RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 50 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A RELEASE OF 11,908 POUNDS OVER A 2?MINUTE RELEASE PERIOD.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES AND WOULD STILL AFFECT 5 PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THE COLORADO  DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT.
