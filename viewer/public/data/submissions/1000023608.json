If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Pierce County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. \n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for wholesale distribution. The facility consists of three 60,000-gallon tanks. \n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 60,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a pull away explosion, leading to an explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends 30 feet from the truck loading area, and public receptors may be within the distance to the endpoint (facility office/connex trailers).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\nFive-year accident history: We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage or evacuations.\n\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Pierce County Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our p"
