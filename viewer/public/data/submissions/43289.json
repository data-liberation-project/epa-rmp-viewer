Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council, Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ?.\n\n68.155 (b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility consists of continuous and batch manufacturing plants producing a variety of end products, including acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methyl methacrylate, melamine, sulfuric acid and aminonitrile.  Processes at the Fortier facility that produce regulated substances are acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methyl methacrylate, melamine, and sulfuric acid.  Other departments in which regulated substances are handled include Utilities and Commercial Development Services.\n\nAcrylonitrile (Acrylonitrile Process), a regulated substance, is used as a raw material to make a variety of products such as plastic fibers, rubbers and fuel mixtures.  Other regulated substances involved with this continuous operation are propylene, hydrocyanic acid, propane and ammonia.\n\nMelamine (Melamine Process) is used to make a variety of products such as hard plastics, laminates, microwave plates, flame retardants, spray paints and adhesives.  The regulated substance involved with this continuous operation is ammonia.\n\nMethyl methacrylate (MMA Process) is used to make many products such as plastics, floor wax and medical devices.

Most of the ammonia was flared after isolating the leak.   Repairs included valve replacement. No off-site impacts resulted from the incident.\n\nLoss of power to the DCS resulted in a release of 5200 pounds of ammonia.  A shelter-in-place was instituted.  No injuries, property damage, or off-site impacts resulted from the incident.\n\nFailure of a tank during transfer of liquid resulted in the release of  1.3 pounds of ammonia and less than one pound of acrylonitrile.  Repairs in excess of $100,000 were required.  No injuries or off-site impacts resulted from the incident.\n  \n 68.155 (e) THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nFortier's Emergency Procedures, which contain plant emergency response guidelines, were developed to reduce the risk of a chemical release to employees and the public.  Communications are with both Jefferson and St. Charles Parish's departments of emergency management, the City of Kenner fire department, Louisiana State Emergency Response, and others as needed.  Fortier responds to incidents with a facility Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responders Operations level.  We have a Community Alert Network (CAN) automated system that can call to warn neighbors of emergency, as well as call in additional Cytec personnel if needed in the event of an emergency.  We also have access to a parish-wide siren/message warning system, should it become necessary to notify neighboring residents of a plant emergency.  Planned quarterly drills are used to test the procedures.  Fortier also has mutual aid agreements with local agencies, which can assist in the event of an emergency.\n\n68.155 (f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Fortier Plant of Cytec Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, and inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve "
