This is an urban area where the endpoint extends 2.41 miles and has the potential of effecting 2,748 residents.  This data was generated with the use of the Degadis software program.\n\n\nAlternate Scenario\n\nA one ton cylinder of chlorine is ruptured while being moved into storage building resulting in a release.  Chlorine is assumed to release at a rate of 200 lbs. per minute for a duration of 10 minutes.

A trainer spends the time necessary to ensure fundamentals of chemical transportation storage, use of class B chlorine repair kits, use of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), first response, first aid and CPR certified, use of the emergency operations plan, and action guide are known by all personnel.\n\nThe second phase is to exercise the skills they learned.  This is done by having drills on specific tasks, e.g. putting on their SCBA and using the B chlorine repair kit.  Drills are conducted until all facility personnel are proficient at their tasks.\n\nThe third phase is testing the emergency operations plan and the skills that the employees learned.  This is accomplished by conducting a full-scale exercise.  During this exercise local emergency response and recovery agencies are involved.\n\nAfter the third phase is completed an After Action Review (AAR) is conducted.  The AAR may result in changes to the emergency operations plan.  Once the plan has been revised, the process will start again on phase one.\n\nThe current emergency response plan consists of two documents:\n\n7 Emergency Action Guide \n7 Emergency Operations Plan\n\nThe Emergency Action Guide is a quick action checklist that consists of emergency responders phone numbers and immediate action steps to protect life, property, and the environment. \n\nThe Emergency Operations Plan is a detailed plan that give further considerations and steps to be taken in the event of an emergency.  \n  \nPlanned Change to Improve Safety\n\nExercising the emergency operations plan in the form of a disaster exercise.  This training will incorporate multiple agencies and will be conducted annually.  \n \nBecome active in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to become better acquainted with community emergency response activities and programs."
