The facility Policy:\n\n    The owners, management and employees of Farmers Elevator Company are Committed to the prevention\n    of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or propane gas.  If an accidental release should accur\n    the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any \n    release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n    a. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of grains and the blending of fertilizers for sale to the\n        farmer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed as a fertilizer for crop production.\n        Ammonia is stored in to approved storage tanks with a total capacity of 210,000 pounds.\n    b. Propane gas is also received, stored and distributed from this facility for the use in grain dryers\n        and home heat.  Propane is stored in three approved storage tanks with a total capacity of 200,000\n        pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  ( Ammonia and Propane)\n\n   a. The worst-case release scenario for Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of both tanks\n       released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 200,000 pounds.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\n    a. Annual training of all full-time and part-time employees in emergengy response and worker protection\n        is just one way the facility prepares its self for a accidental release. The company also complies with:\n    b. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standard- 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and\n         and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n    c. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standard- 29 CFR 1910.110 Storage and \n        Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History:\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammo"
