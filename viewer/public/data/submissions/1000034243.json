If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\r\n\u00b7\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\r\n\u00b7\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 113,815 pounds in our one 26,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 113815 is rounded to 110000.\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 113,815 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 113815 is rounded to 110000.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (this distance is rounded to the first two significant digits) 2.2 miles.\r\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of Safety Requiremen"
