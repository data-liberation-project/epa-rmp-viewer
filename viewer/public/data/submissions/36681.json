      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAt the Martin Transport, Inc. (Martin) Kilgore Mobil Pipeline facility, we handle substances considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  This commitment led our company to financially contribute to the Gregg and Harrison Counties First Call? Telephone Warning System. \n\nAdditionally, it is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Gregg County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Kilgore Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMartin complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidenta"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMartin maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a ?What if? checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our process, Martin maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n\nTraining\n\nMartin has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the process. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMartin carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Martin Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of an"

The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nMartin conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of butane.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n Employee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin, that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Our employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of emergency response procedures should an accidental release occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of LPG during this period that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage o"

The emergency action plan includes appropriate mechanisms for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  The facility is listed in the Community Emergency Response Plan.  This satisfies the requirements of the RMP rules.\n\nAdditionally, the program includes procedures for notification of the Gregg County LEPC, the Kilgore Fire Department and use of the First Call? Telephone Warning System.  First Call? is a telephone warning system for citizens of Gregg and Harrison Counties.  First Call? uses computers and a recorded human voice to provide citizens with critical information concerning an emergency.  This system will allow citizens to take immediate action to protect themselves in the event of an emergency and permits emergency response agencies to focus on other activities to bring the emergency under control.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the Martin.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations."
