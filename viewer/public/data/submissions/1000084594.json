Madison Terminal Complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is GROWMARK Policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Montrose Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Ft. Madison Terminal is owned by GROWMARK Inc., propane is received via pipeline and stored in pressure tanks.  From these vessels, propane is loaded into tanker trucks for distribution.  Propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Ft. Madison Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal; however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has developed the worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld from the Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations. \n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAt the Ft. Madison Terminal we handle propane that is recognized by the EPA as a regulated, flammable substance. The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautio"

First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while onsite as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. \n\n\n\nThe Ft. Madison Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this terminal include:\n\n\n\nA? Emergency shutoff valves at each loading hose supplied with cables for remote closure in the event of a hose rupture or piping break.\n\nA? Level, pressure, temperature and relief instrumentation on storage tanks to help prevent overfilling.\n\nA? Hydrocarbon gas detectors located in the area of the truck loading pumps and the truck loading area, the most likely locations of a leak.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm and trigger the emergency shutdown system.\n\nA? Excess flow valves on the inlet lines and outlet lines for each storage tank to shut-off the tank during large release situations.\n\nA? Solenoid operated valves on each storage tank liquid inlet and outlet line, which can be activated by hitting the emergency shutdown button.\n\nA? Product flow to the two truck loading lanes controlled via an Accuload III system which monitors mercaptan addition, verifies proper grounding, and records the amount of product loaded..\n\n\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operational performance which includes the prevention of incidents, injuries, and releases at the facility. Primary elements of continuous improvement efforts include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining u to date procedures, and continu"

The integrity and reliability of major equipment including; pumps, pipelines, and storage tanks are assured through periodic inspection and preventative maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards. Corrosion to the external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks are minimized with periodic inspections and painting maintenance. \n\nThe system is equipped with shutdown systems which include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate the problem once detected. \n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Ft. Madison Terminal within the last five years. \n\n\n\n6.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility is considered a non-responding site. The facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which includes procedures for notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement following consultation with facility personnel. Should an actual incident occur, the EAP gives guidance to employees in how to respond to minor accidents, incidental spills, and/or small fires. Portable fire extinguishers are maintained throughout the site. \n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance and safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time. \n\n"
