This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nCornerstone operates the Cornerstone Gas Plant located in Grimes County, Texas.  The gas plant receives produced natural gas via pipeline. Residue gas is removed from the plant by pipeline. The hydrocarbon liquids are trucked out.\r\n\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic\r\nsubstances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, Copano identified\r\nthe regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\r\n\r\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Cornerstone Gas Plant are a flammable mixture consisting of a Y-Grade (C2+ NGL). \r\n\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant has not had an accidental release in the past five years and emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the Iola Volunteer Fire Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Cornerstone Gas Plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to im"

Examples of employee participation range from\r\nupdating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a\r\nmember of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information\r\ncreated as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees\r\ncan be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee\r\nparticipation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention\r\nprogram element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address\r\nprocess safety and employee safety issues.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help\r\nmaintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and\r\nassociated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and\r\nequipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments which support the gas plant\r\nare assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\r\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information\r\nis supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any\r\nknown hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process\r\nareas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters\r\n(e.g., temperature, level, composition"

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained\r\nwithin these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained\r\npersonnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards\r\nassociated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each\r\nprocess is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are\r\nin place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP/What If analysis technique to perform these\r\nevaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and\r\nmaintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates\r\nhazards of the process as we'll as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution.\r\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by the report\r\nwritten by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are\r\ntracked until they are completed.

Once again, the team\r\nfindings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the\r\nfindings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown, (4) normal shutdown, and (5) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Cornerstone Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\r\ndemonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner\r\non their own, they can work independently.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nScheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees or certified contractors will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or plant management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Cornerstone Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment under"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered\r\nprocesses. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals,\r\ntechnology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be\r\nproperly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1)\r\nensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that\r\nexisting controls have not been compromised by the change. Chemical hazard information,\r\nprocess operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or\r\nreasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental\r\nloss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop\r\ncorrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The\r\ninvestigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a\r\nrecurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions\r\ntaken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until\r\ncompleted. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so\r\nthat the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Cornerstone Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. The audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Cornerstone Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Cornerstone Gas Plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2)\r\nquickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The\r\nfollowing types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n-Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n-Release Containment/Control\r\n-Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack or flare\r\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n-Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n-Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n-Atmospheric relief devices\r\n-Release Mitigation\r\n-Fire extinguishers\r\n-Trained personnel\r\n-Personal protective equipmen"
