Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMillerCoors Shenandoah Brewery located in Elkton, Virginia is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated ammonia refrigeration systems.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  If such a release does occur, we have a trained in-house Emergency Response Team (ERT).  Additionally, we are completely coordinated with the McGaheysville Fire Department and the Harrisonburg / Rockingham LEPC for emergency response assistance.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility operates a brewing, packaging and distribution operation of MillerCoors products.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance present is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration systems.  The two (2) ammonia refrigeration systems (DC / Packaging & Brewery) onsite are connected, but an isolation valve separating the systems.  For the purpose of this RMP, we manage these systems as one covered RMP process.\n\n\n\nHere is a summary of some of our recent RMP activity:\n\n\n\n  ?  June 24, 1999 - Initial Submission\n\n  ?
