(\"RCS, Inc.\") for GENCO in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). GENCO operates a warehouse facility with hazardous substances that are covered under 112(r).\n\n\n\nRCS, Inc. has been retained by GENCO to investigate this facility's need to implement a Risk Management Plan. RCS, Inc. reviewed Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for all products. Following the product review, four (4) products stored at the facility contained constituents that were listed under RMP.\n\n\n\nThe second stage in completing this plan was to investigate the storage history for each constituent. After review of the inventories, the investigation revealed that an aerosol propellant mixture containing Isobutane (propane) exceeded the threshold quantity listed in 112(r).\n\n\n\nThe RMP requirements were designed to facilitate communication to responders and the public in the event of a catastrophic release of the listed substances. These requirements also insure the continuing improvement and safety of each identified process. Major facilities needing to comply with 112(r) may be defined as; a facility that is used to store large volumes of highly hazardous substances for use in manufacturing, treatment processes or bulk storage. Some of the requirements are not applicable to a closed container non-bulk facility. All items that are not applicable are provided with an explanation in the attachments to this plan.\n\n\n\nThe RMP has three (3) different models to follow when completing a plan. The models are based on types of products, processes, and quantities. This plan meets the requirement of Program 1. \n\n\n\nUnder Program 1 GENCO is not required develop a plan in response  to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (\"OSHA\") Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\n 1.1 The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the"

In fully demonstrating compliance with the standards set forth in Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act, GENCO is implementing a Risk Management Program through this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a closed-container distribution facility for appropriately marked, labeled and packaged non-bulk consumer products. Some products contain substances that are considered extremely hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). These products are stored within specially designed areas of the warehouse. These locations have been engineered to store aerosol products, following guidelines established by Building Officials Code Association (\"BOCA\") Guidelines, and National Fire Protection Association (\"NFPA\") Guidelines.\n\n\n\nGENCO is dedicated to providing a safe, publicly aware, environmentally friendly solution to logistics management. All procedures at the facility have been written to ensure Teammate and public safety. Procedures are continuously reviewed and revised based on facility need, management review and Teammate suggestions.\n\n\n\nWhen any Teammate discovers any release of a hazardous substance, the emergency response procedures developed at GENCO are implemented. The first step for a Teammate would be to immediately notify his or her supervisor. The supervisor will immediately contact the Primary Emergency Coordinator. Upon notification of a release, the Primary Coordinator will immediately contact the local fire department, the police department, the Community Emergency Planning Committee, the Florida DEP State Warning Point, and the outside response contractor.\n\n\n\nThe facility emergency evacuation procedures will occur whenever management or the local response offici"

The emergency coordinator will ensure that emergency equipment has unfettered entrance to the facility.\n\n\n\n 1.2 The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nGENCO is a closed container warehouse for Unilever Company product. The facility does not manufacture, package, re-package, transfer, or handle raw product. The facility has two processes that deal with hazardous substances regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe first process includes the docking of trailers containing finished product, unloading the trailers using motorized forklifts, storage of the product in designated areas. It consists of loading the trailers with motorized forklifts, and the un-docking of the trailers and transport from the property. \n\n\n\nThe second process is the storage of the products with in the facility. The products that are stored at this facility are varied in concentrations, physical states, and constituents. Only a small amount of the products in the warehouse contain regulated hazardous substances. \n\nDue to the constant change in inventory driven by the industry demand of Unilever product, GENCO does not have a steady amount of regulated substances in the warehouse. To determine the maximum amount of regulated substances stored in the building, a review of product inventories was conducted to achieve a historical maximum storage. The maximum storage was used to calculate possible quantities that may be released.\n\n\n\nDuring a review of all the products, including constituents and concentrations, it was determined that a flammable propellant mixture containing Isobutane (propane, 2-methyl) is above the thresholds designated by the EPA. The quantity of the propellant mixture containing Isobutane is .301 pounds, and the total quantity in the     facility is 273,067.2 pounds.\n\n\n\n 1.3 Worst-case release scenario and the alternative rele"

In this worst case scenario, no mitigating measures are present to contain the release.
