In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used at the facility.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nAn investigation into the Park 100 Foods accident history showed that there had been no reportable accidents with ammonia in the last 5 years. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia incident.\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nPark 100 Foods has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Kiosk located in the employee Break Room. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment\r\n  4.)  To minimize property damage\r\n\r\nThe Park 100 Foods maintains a PSM Team, whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nItems identified during Inspections, Audits, PHA's, and maintenance activities continue to be addressed as they are identified."

In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Park 100 Foods facility is located at 326 East Adams St. Tipton, IN. The facility has an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\r\nThe system uses approximately 16,409 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for refrigerated and frozen storage of :a variety of goods to include but is not limited to; various food ingredients, soups, sauces and side dishes. The majority of the system including vessels and compressors are located inside and outside of the facility building. \r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nPark 100 Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia s"
