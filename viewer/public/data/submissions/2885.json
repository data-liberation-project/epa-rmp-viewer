Our facility has one 25,000 gallon tank for storing anhydrous, and one 15,000 gallon and one 30,000 gallon tank for storing aqua, equipment for receiving anhydrous and aqua by truck, and equipment for transferring anhydrous and aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from a tank or truck if any anhydrous hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the anhydrous storage tanks to prevent overpressuring and rupturing the tanks.\n3. Diking around the aqua storage area, to contain accidental aqua spills.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures. We have also coordinated with the Garfield County Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous storage tank.  According to information supplied by the EPA the area affected by this release would extend 4.2 miles from our facility, and would include the city of Pomeroy, its schools, the hospital, and city recreation areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the"
