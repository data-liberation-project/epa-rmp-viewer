The City is committed to there employees in the safe handling of chlorine.  We are also committed to reducing the threat to nearby members of the community.  All employees that handle chlorine in its containers are hazwopper certified.  \nOur emergency response program will be coordinate with the Port Arthur Fire and Police Deaprtments.  Our emergency plan includes procedures for notifying any affected neighborhoods.\n2.  The stationary service and regulated substances handled.\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to treat and disinfect the wastewater effluent.  Chlorine is the only toxic chemical over the threshold limit used at this facility.  It is received in ton containers and is used for disinfection.  The facility has equipment in use for the safe handling and storage of the ton containers.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 32,000 pounds.\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst case scenario-Rupture of a ton cylinder would release 2000 lbs of chlorine.  An additional 1200 lbs would escape through the ruptured drum from the manifold system.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint is 0087 mg/L.  All liquid leaks will be handled as a worst case scenario.\nAlternative Release Scenario-A 1/4 inch tubing that runs from the ton cylinder to the manifold breaks and releases chlorine gas.  It is estimated that 500 lbs of chlorine would be releases in a 60 minute time period.  Plant personnel will handle all gas leaks in order to minimize the release.\n4.  The general accidental relese prevention program and the specific prevention steps.  \nAccidenta"

Specific prevention steps include training of employees, safe hadling of cylinders, and inspection and maintenace of the system.  Inventory of spare parts that are subject to failure are kept on hand.\n5.  Five year history.\nThe wastewater treatment plants have not had any RMP releases during the past five years.  (1994-1998).\n6.  The emergency respose program.\nOur emergency response program will be coordinated through the Port Arthur Fire Deaprtment and their hazmat team.  Ton cylinder repair kits will be kept at the wastewater plant and on the Fire Department response truck.  Class A encapsulated suit will also be kept at both locations.  \n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n*  Upgrade the chlorine feed system\n*  Revisions to arsenal training program\n*  Replacement of all obsolete safety equipment\n*  Revisons of written operating procedure"
