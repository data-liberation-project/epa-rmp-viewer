This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant is located at 3702 Clanton Road in Augusta, GA.  The plant is owned by BP Amoco Chemical Company.  Various chemical are processed to produce engineering plastics.  Regulated substances at the plant in excess of the RMP threshold quantity are sulfur trioxide and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nSince the plant has no flammable substances above the threshhold quantity, no worst case scenario (WCS) for all flammable substances is reported.  \n\nThe toxic WCS for the plant is a sixty minute release of 180,000 pounds of sulfur trioxide from the catastrophic failure of a sulfur trioxide rail car.   The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the distance to the endpoint.  Nearby public receptors could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nSince the plant has no flammable substances above the threshhold quantity, no alternative case scenario (ACS) for all flammable substances is repo"

Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nThe toxic ACS for anhydrous ammonia assumes a 1 minute release of 600 pounds from a 1 inch diameter transfer hose failure.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.61 miles.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the  EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element.  In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the pr"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems).  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA teams recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Amoco Polymers, Inc., Augusta plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.
