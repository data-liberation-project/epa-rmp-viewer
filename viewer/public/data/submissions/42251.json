Salem?s accidental release prevention program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employee participation, process safety and operating information, process hazard analysis and compliance auditing, pre-startup reviews, mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and updating practices and procedures. Applicable requirements for Program 3 Risk Management Programs are adhered to. The emergency response program is tailored with respect to the available emergency responders and the City of Salem Local Emergency Planning Coordinator (LEPC) and includes notification procedures as well as plant evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination system for the Salem Water Treatment Plant is used to disinfect drinking water. This water is supplied to the residents and businesses in or near the City. The chlorination facilities include a Chlorine Storage Room for one-ton cylinders and the necessary cylinder handling equipment, and a Chlorine Feed Room with ten chlorinators and various safety equipment and controls,. Normally chlorine is supplied from six one-ton cylinders connected to the process feed piping. The cylinders in service are controlled automatically using an automatic switchover device that limits operation from a single cylinder. Plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system at least once each shift and respond immediately to trouble or warning alarms.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios identified as the worst-case scenario and the alternate release scenario. Predictive release information was obtained using the EPA?s (Environmental Protection Agency) RMP* COMP model to identify the distance to endp"

      "SummaryText": "oint for a potential chlorine release. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves a failure or rupture of a one-ton cylinder outside of the Chlorine Storage Room releasing the entire 2,000 pound contents of the cylinder within ten minutes. The distance to endpoint was estimated to be 1.30 miles from the chlorination facility assuming a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour and an atmospheric stability rating of ?Class F?. The potential population affected by the worst-case scenario was estimated to be 8,500 persons. \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a potential pipe leak where 1,500 pounds of chlorine gas may be released during a ten minute accidental release. The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.20 miles from the chlorination facility assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and an atmospheric rating of ?Class D?. The endpoint determination includes enclosure of the cylinder within the storage room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 200 persons.\n\n\n\nActuation of the Chlorine Gas Detectors is considered to be an active mitigation measure. Additionally, the chlorine gas piping is vacuum tubing connected directly to the chlorine cylinders. A loss of vacuum in the tubing immediately stops the flow of chlorine gas from the cylinders and virtually eliminates the possibility of a chlorine release due a piping leak. The Salem Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a Chlorine Gas Scrubber, which is also considered to be an active mitigation measure.\n\n\n\nThe Salem Water Treatment Plant RMP has the key elements listed below. These elements are aimed at preventing a chlorine release from the chlorination system.\n\n\n\n* High level of operator training and maintenance training;\n\n* An established preventive maintenance program;\n\n* Implementation of an audit and inspection program;\n\n* Use of effective written operating procedures;\n\n* Implementation of an employee participation program;\n\n* Use of emergency air supply and cyl"

The new Salem Water Treatment Plant will be placed into service in February 2005.\n\n\n\nAn emergency response plan is established and is coordinated with the City of Salem LEPC. The plan includes plant evacuation procedures, emergency notification procedures for first responders, and a general public notification plan. Plant evacuation drills are performed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38. Emergency response drills are performed in accordance with LEPC schedules.\n\n\n\n"
