The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:  \r\n\r\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.  The hierarchy starts with the facility design and construction which is to all applicable design standards using qualified engineers and contractors.  A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels and piping.  These checks are done using nondestructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.  \r\n\r\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in environmental compliance.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown and emergency conditions.  Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.  \r\n\r\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.

The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is operated jointly with its neighbor, Evonik Corporation and is based on the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  There are at least 21 trained emergency responders in the fire and rescue squad that are divided into shifts and day workers.  Each shift has a fire and rescue squad that is led by the shift safety officer.  In an emergency, the safety officer assumes on-scene command of any incident.  On-site emergency resources include a fire/foam truck, a rescue truck and ambulance.  In addition to these resources, Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC is a member of the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) and can count on pooled resources from surrounding plants and communities.  As a member of the LEPC, Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC regularly stages emergency response drills both in-house and outside with emergency responders from the public and private sector."

The only RMP covered process is the Polyvinyl Alcohol production unit.  \r\n\r\nIn the PVOH unit, VAM is polymerized in a solvent to make polyvinyl acetate (PVAc).  PVAc is converted to polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), which is ground to a granule, dried, stored, packaged and shipped in bags, trucks and railcars.  PVOH is a water soluble powder that is used in applications such as water-based adhesives and to protect fibers as they are woven into fabrics.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this stationary source is:\r\n\r\n\u00b7Vinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 211,300 pounds\r\n\r\n3.  The worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \r\n\r\nIn the plant, the greatest VAM inventory is contained in one of three storage tanks.   Under worst case conditions of a single tank failure, the entire contents of the tank would be released from the tank and be contained in an earthen dike around the tanks.  Using the EPA look-up tables for rural terrain, the vaporized VAM would spread to endpoint that would exceed plant boundaries.  Although there are active controls directed at preventing such a release and controlling the consequences, no credit was taken for active mitigation methods in evaluating this Worst Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case for a toxic liquid at the plant is the overpressure of a PVOH polymerization reactor and a subsequent VAM release from the pressure relief system.  It was calculated that 5,900 pounds of VAM were released and vaporized to the environment.  Using the EPA lookup tables and default weather conditions, the radius to the endpoint would exceed plant boundaries.
