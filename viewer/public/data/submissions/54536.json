This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule.  The facility is covered by the rule because it processes anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory thresholds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility\u00bfs refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity.\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years.  The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity.  The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement.  The RMP will be made available to the public.  The purpose of this project was to compile an updated RMP.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia.  The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that 5,100 pounds of ammonia was released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp.  The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 0.7 miles.  It was further determined that within 0.7 miles of the facility there is a population of 104 people.  The public receptors identified within 0.7 miles of the facility are residences, a church, and commercial/industrial areas.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release of ammonia resulting from a failure during normal operation.  This is the same vessel as examined"

      "SummaryText": "in the worst-case release.  However, for the alternative release scenario the quantity released is based on the more realistic normal operating inventory of the vessel rather than the largest quantity that may ever be present in the vessel.  In this scenario, 3,900 pounds of ammonia are released over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 0.1 miles.  The population within 0.1 miles of the facility was determined to be 25.  There were no public or environmental receptors identified within 0.1 miles of the facility.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analyses data and information concerning the facility and the facility\u00bfs implementation of the risk management program are included in the risk management plan documented in this report."
