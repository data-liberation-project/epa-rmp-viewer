Executive Summary \r\n\r\nInternational Paper Company (INTERNATIONAL PAPER) owns and operates the Quinnesec Mill, an integrated pulp and paper facility located approximately 2 miles east of Quinnesec, Michigan. INTERNATIONAL PAPER is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for INTERNATIONAL PAPER workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, INTERNATIONAL PAPER has developed and implemented Environmental, Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all it's employees and operations. INTERNATIONAL PAPER believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. \r\n\r\nAs part of this commitment, INTERNATIONAL PAPER has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at INTERNATIONAL PAPER and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at INTERNATIONAL PAPER.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at INTERNATIONAL PAPER.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at INTERNATIONAL PAPER consists of three elements:"

Corrective actions were taken to eliminate the possibility for similar incidents to occur in the future.  The Quinnesec Mill is committed to maintaining a high level of safety performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Response Programs\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL PAPER has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\n\t* clear identification of communication, roles and responsibilities during an emergency event.\r\n\t* informing the LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\r\n\t* providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at INTERNATIONAL PAPER\r\n\t* controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of specially trained Hazardous Material Response Teams and emergency response equipment\r\n\t* inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\r\n\t* reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\r\n \r\nThe Quinnesec Mill maintains an emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All INTERNATIONAL PAPER personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  INTERNATIONAL PAPER periodically conducts emergency response drills, The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials and local fire departments.  INTERNATIONAL PAPER maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire officials and provides response information, as appropriate. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Quinnesec Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of the regulated processes by following recommended safe practices,"

Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures, as well as access to information on the covered processes. \r\n\r\n\t11.\tHot Work Permits:  INTERNATIONAL PAPER uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Quinnesec Mill. INTERNATIONAL PAPER reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel performing hot work are required to have an approved permit prior to beginning their work.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the INTERNATIONAL PAPER safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n\t12.\tContractors:  INTERNATIONAL PAPER has established Contractor Guidelines for Safety and Health to outline expectations related to contractor work, at the Quinnesec Mill including work on the covered processes.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that INTERNATIONAL PAPER only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  INTERNATIONAL PAPER explains to the contract supervisors and employees the hazards of the process on which they will work, INTERNATIONAL PAPER safe work practices, and INTERNATIONAL PAPER emergency response procedures, utilizing a contractor work permit system.  INTERNATIONAL PAPER periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \r\n\r\n\r\n1.3.2  Program 2 Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Quinnesec Mill has no processes which qualify for the Program 2 Prevention Program.\r\n\r\n1.3.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, INTERNATIONAL PAPER has implemented safety features specific to t"

      "SummaryText": "he hazardous substances used at the Quinnesec Mill.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features. \r\n\r\nChlorine Processes:   Chlorine is supplied to the Quinnesec Mill in DOT-approved 1-ton containers. Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is safely absorbed into process water.  This vacuum operated system provides a high degree of reliability and safety. Our chlorine systems are located indoors within isolated room areas, which further reduces the potential for a chlorine release impacting the surrounding area.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs.   These alarms sound at the chlorine room areas, and also on operator control displays, which are constantly monitored to help ensure quick response. \r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide System: Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to a water absorption column, where a 1.2 wt % chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Quinnesec Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to minimize the potential for serious incident or off-site impact.  The process is located almost entirely indoors, which further reduces the hazard.  Storage tanks are engineered specifically for chlorine dioxide service.  Inventory is limited to an 8 hour supply for bleaching.  The process uses an advanced control system, with emergency shutdowns, to ensure safe operation.  Containment sewers and curbing are provided to minimize the extent of potential leaks. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring for chlorine dioxide in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL PAPER has completed a review for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation.
