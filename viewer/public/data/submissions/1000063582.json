The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nCovered Process 3 (i.e. Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting) equipment associated with this covered process includes a mobile pipe reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by an Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor (IFRC). Ammonium Polyphosphate (i.e. 10-34-0) is a fertilizer that is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with water and super-phosphoric acid in a stationary reactor (i.e. Ammonium Polyphosphate Reacting). When manufacturing Ammonium Polyphosphate the IFRC connects its MPR to the anhydrous ammonia stationary storage tanks, (2) the water supply at the Zenith Facility, and (3) a railcar containing the super-phosphoric acid. The IFRC transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the stationary storage tank to its MPR. The IFRC is responsible for the transfer of anhydrous ammonia while its equipment is connected to the stationary storage tank. The Facility requires that the IFRC have in place and demonstrates compliance with its OSHA PSM for the MPR operations. ",
