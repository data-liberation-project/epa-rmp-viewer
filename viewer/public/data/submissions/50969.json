      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) 5 year re-submission for the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Good Humor-Breyers Ice Cream facility (aka Conopco dba Unilever) in Sikeston, MO North.  The original RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk  Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements of the EPA RMP.  \n\nA.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor - Breyers recognizes management?s responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Sikeston, MO North facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company?s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The site also complies with all bioterrorism requirements from the FDA and Department of Homeland Security.  The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for implement"

      "SummaryText": "ation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor - Breyers operates an ice cream production facility in Sikeston, MO North.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CSAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is 114,300 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA?s RM program.\n\nC.    Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n?    Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n?    Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes th"

Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If-Technique have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n\n?    Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n?    Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n?    Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n?    Hot Work Permit:  These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.  \n\n?    Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.  \n\n?    Incident Investigation:  The procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.\n\n?    Compliance Audits:  There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.\n\nD.

Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Sikeston, MO North facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. \n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n\nOrganization Plan and Responsibilities \nCommunications Procedures \nDetailed Action Plans\nFirst Aid Procedures \nEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures\nEvacuation Plans\nDescription of Outside Assistance Available\nSite Re-Entry Procedures \nTraining Programs and Drills\n\nG.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Sikeston MO North facility is incorporated with numerous beneficial design features that allow for maximized safety and operating conditions.  Therefore, at present, no major changes have been planned to further improve safety conditions.  Additional recommendations will be reviewed during each future Process Hazard Analysis."
