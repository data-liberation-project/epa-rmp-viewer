No accidental releases have occurred at SACHS with the previously mentioned characteristics. \n\nF) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nSACHS has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) based upon the guidelines of the National Response Team (NRT); these guidelines are spelled out in 61 FR 28641-28664. The ICP has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) emergency response plan. SACHS\u2019s ICP is designed to minimize hazards to human health and the environment from contingencies such as medical emergencies, chemical/waste/oil releases (including releases of regulated substances), fires/explosions, natural disasters, general threats, biological agent threats, and air pollution emergency episodes of CAA\u2019s criteria pollutants at SACHS. The ICP, in turn, constitutes the Emergency Response Plan for releases of regulated substances, as required by SACHS\u2019s Risk Management Program.\n\n\nG) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe compliance audit conducted at SACHS for overseeing compliance with 40 CFR 68 Program 2 Prevention Program elements for the original RMP (year 2008) identified the following change to improve the safety of the only-regulated process at the facility [storage in containers of hydrochloric acid (concentration 37% or greater)]: provide secondary containment to the containers. SACHS implemented this process change on June 30th, 2008. The secondary containment system consists of dikes [i.e., semicircular bumps at warehouse exit points; the bumps are made of Stonclad GS epoxy mortar and have an approximate height of one (1) inch \u2013 the system provides a secondary containment capacity of about 21,000 gallons, which is well above the potential worst-case scenario release quantity of 220 gallons of the regulated substance].\nNo planned changes to improve safety are required at present (i."

No environmental receptors (as defined in 40 CFR 68.3) were identified.\n\n\nD) PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\nThe Program 2 Prevention Program elements of 40 CFR 68 were developed and implemented by SACHS as part of SACHS Occupational Health & Safety programs. Following are the highlights of such program:\n     \u2022\tSACHS maintains updated safety information (SDS, equipment manuals, safe process \n       conditions, codes and standards used to develop the process, etc.) for its only-regulated \n       process at the facility [storage in containers of hydrochloric acid (concentration 37% or \n       greater)].\n     \u2022\tSACHS has a sound management system to oversee the effective implementation of its \n       Program 2 Prevention Program.\n     \u2022\tThere are effective controls to minimize the possibility of a release from the regulated \n       process/substance (including physical measures, administrative/procedural controls, \n        preventive/reactive maintenance, and trained staff).\n     \u2022\tSafeguards for unplanned events [such as two (2) electricity generation units for power \n      failures]. \n\nE) FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\u00a768.42(a) requires to facilities affected by 40 CFR 68 include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, o"

Since there are no meteorological monitoring stations at or near SACHS, the default meteorology/values provided by RMP*Comp were utilized for both the worst-case/alternative OCAs. Only the following information/values were input into RMP*Comp: area setting (i.e., urban), release quantity, and ambient/liquid temperatures. \nFor the estimate of the population affected within the estimated release-impacted zones, MARPLOT version 5.1.1 (December 2017) was used; MARPLOT was also used to develop radius maps of the potential release-impacted zones. For the determination of offsite impacts to the environment, a review of the USGS 7.5 topographic quadrangle for Aguas Buenas was used, together with a physical reconnaissance of the areas in the immediate vicinity of the site (i.e., at the release impact zones estimated by the OCAs).\nFor the worst-case release scenario, SACHS considered four (4) 55-gallon containers of the regulated substance [i.e., the four (4) containers stored within a pallet] to be involved in the worst-case release. This corresponds to an estimated quantity of 2,184 pounds of the regulated substance involved in the release; the release was assumed to occur at ground level, within an elapsed period of ten (10) minutes, and with the following mitigation measure allowed by RMP*Comp: \u201crelease in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air\u201d.
