      "SummaryText": "A.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe management and staff of the Denver Milk Plant are committed to operating their facility with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Denver Milk Plant personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Denver Milk Plant personnel, and the environment, the plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Denver Milk Plant's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\nB.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Denver Milk Plant operates a fluid milk processing plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the facility.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Denver Milk Plant which is subject to the EPA RMP rule ( and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the +17 F Pump Trap where the pressure is dropped to 30 psig.  From the High Pressure Receiver, liquid ammonia is also transferred to the Blowmold Chillers.  The +17 F Pump Trap transfers liquid ammonia to the evaporators and the Ice builder.  Ammonia vapor from the Ice Builder and evaporators, and ammonia liquid from the Blowmold Chiller, returns to the Pump Trap.  \n\nThe vapor from the +17 F Pump Trap is routed to the six Compressors.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammoni"

An Auto Purger purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the Condenser.  The system also has an emergency refrigerant control box located outside of the machine room where pressure can be manually relieved from one vessel to another. \n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMuch of the safety of the system at the Denver Milk Plant facility is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Denver Milk Plant facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1965 Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors and pressure relief valves to protect vessels' integrity. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the past five years (April 2002 - April 2007), the Denver Milk Plant has not had any reportable ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or offsite evacuations.\n\n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Denver Milk Plant facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Respons"

Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Denver Fire Department and the local fire houses.  If necessary, the facility will call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.\n\nOther responders will be called as needed, including the Denver Fire Department.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\nThe Denver Milk Plant will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees in case of an emergency evacuation.  Other training received by employees includes:what to do in case of emergency, and where to go when an evacuation is called. \n\nThe following summarizes the notification procedures at the facility:\n\n1.  First call 911 on an internal/land line phone for the Denver Fire Department and Police Departments.  The Denver Fire Department can be reached directly at 303-286-4927.\n\n2.  EPA Region 8 24 hour Emergency Response can be contacted at 1-800-227-8914.\n\n3.  If additional help is required for an ammonia spill or leak, the facilities can call Chemtrec - Manufacturing Chemists Association 1-800-424-9300.\n\n4.  If an ammonia release exceeds 100 pounds (Federal Reportable Quantity CERCLA), call the National Response Center 1-800-424-8802 and the Denver Office of Emergency Management at 720-865-7600 for a release of any amount.\n\n5.  If serious injuries or harmful exposures to workers occurs, call the nearest OSHA Field Office in Denver at 1-800-755-7090 (or 303-844-5285), or the OSHA Region 8 Office in Denver at 303-844-1600.\n\n6.  If an employee ingests ammonia, the Poison Control Center can be reached 24 hours per day at 800-342-9293.\n\n7.  If an ammonia release is significant enough to potentially cause odor complaints from neighboring facilities, contact the City of Denver.\n\n8.
