In the event of a liquid ammonia leak, the king\nvalves (outlet of the high pressure liquid receiver) can be closed automatically or manually to prevent flow of\nammonia liquid to downstream equipment. The system can be shutdown by the computer control system or by\ntwo emergency stop stations located: 1. In the engine room at the north exit; and, 2.Outside the engine room\nback door.\nIn addition, ammonia sensors located in the engine room and in all ammonia refrigerated areas can shutdown\nthe ammonia system when ammonia concentrations reach unacceptable PPM levels (>15PPM).\nThe facility is equipped with a sprinkler system.\nResponse Capabilities\nThe facility has a trained haz-mat response team and the local community haz-mat response team will be trained\nand equipped in early/mid 2004.\nAmmonia System Summary\nMajor equipment components include:\n\u00bf5 Compressors\n\u00bf50 Evaporators\n\u00bf2 Evaporative Condensers\n\u00bf1 Purger\n\u00bf3 Liquid Recirculators\n\u00bf3 Ammonia Pumps\n\u00bf1 High Pressure Liquid Receiver\n\u00bf1 Controlled Pressure Receiver"
