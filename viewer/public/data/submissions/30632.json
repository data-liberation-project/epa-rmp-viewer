Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, has been safely used to disinfect drinking water for nearly 100 years, reducing or eliminating the risk of such waterborne diseases as Cholera, Typhoid and Dysentery.\n\nThe City and County of Butte-Silver Bow (BSB) have long understood the potential hazards and risks in handling chlorine.  Chlorine exceeding the 2,500-pound threshold level is required to submit a Risk Management Program to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Big Hole Water Treatment Plant has more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine on site.  The Risk Management Program Rule has helped enhance the existing safety programs such, as the respiratory protection plan, a regular maintenance program and an annual safety training program to address changes in the system and chemicals used at the facility.  It has also ensured that in the unlikely event of a chlorine release, local emergency responders and other authorities are fully trained and ready to engage specific plans to mitigate the situation quickly and safely.\n\nThe Big Hole Water Treatment Plant has used chlorine to disinfect water since December 1994.  Since that date, the plant has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine. The plant treats approximately 6 mgd and has a design capacity of 16 mgd.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) is designed to prevent and minimize the impacts of an accidental release of chlorine from the Big Hole Water Treatment Plant.  The RMPA?s worst-case scenario, operating procedures, process hazard analysis and emergency response plan have been reviewed and updated to comply with the resubmission of the RMP for Chemical Accident Prevention.

The employees have been trained on the hazards and the procedures for handling chlorine, as well as the other chemicals throughout the plant.  They have the knowledge and skills, as certified operators, to operate the treatment facility system to minimize a chlorine exposure.\n\nBSB is confident that the added protection of the Risk Management Plan will ensure that its personnel, the environment and the community will continue to remain safe and healthy.\n\nAmy Manger\nRisk Management Analyst, Butte-Silver Bow\n"
