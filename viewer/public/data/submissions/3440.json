Our KEEP management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through KEEP.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.  \n\nThe Huntington Terminal is one of many facilities operated by Koch Fertilizer Storage & Terminal Company (Koch) along a 2,500 mile pipeline supplying anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used as a fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Huntington Terminal.  There are no RMP flammable substances at the site above threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  At the terminal we receive anhydrous ammonia from a central pipeline and store it until it is loaded on trucks and railcars for distribution.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our ammonia operations at the terminal, our progra"

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulation, our worst case release scenario would be the loss of all of the ammonia in our largest vessel within 10 minutes.  In the case of the Huntington Terminal, this would involve our 30,000 ton refrigerated ammonia storage tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that ammonia vapors could travel, in this hypothetical case, would be greater than 25 miles from our facility.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  The alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario that could involve an offsite exposure to ammonia vapors, is calculated to reach 1.5 miles from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario. Once again, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this alternative release scenario.  We selected the alternative release scenario based on our ammonia storage bullet being overfilled when ammonia is being delivered by pipeline into the facility.  If such an incident occurred, three relief valves on top of the bullet would be activated during the filling process.  These valves ensure that the entire bullet does not rupture and only a minor controllable release results.   The 2.5 inch diameter valves could release the ammonia at a rate of approximately 1.6 tons pe"

We measure the level of liquid ammonia in the bullet on a continuous basis.  If this level becomes too high, the motor-operated valve on the inlet pipe to the bullet is automatically closed.  If higher levels are then detected in the bullet, an additional reverse check valve will automatically be closed on the inlet pipe.  High pressure in the ammonia storage bullet will similarly result in the check valve being closed. The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.  \n\nWe have also discussed this potential release with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Huntington County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Huntington Terminal has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7 We require a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the transfer hose is properly disconnected.\n7 We replaced propane tanks and associated propane vaporizers with natural gas for use in heating to avoid the potential of propane releases.\n7 We installed continuous pilots in our flares in order to ensure no interruption in the combustion of ammonia vapors, even during high winds.\n7 We installed backup generators to ensure that the flare continues to "

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Huntington Terminal with the Huntington Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response would be the Huntington Police Department, the Huntington County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the Memorial  Hospital located in Huntington, and the Utility Company.  The Huntington Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drills, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n \n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n \nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Huntington Terminal.
