We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\nIn conjunction with the Process Hazard Assessment (Section 2 of the Program), we have completed a compilation of written process safety information in order to enable our supervisory personnel and our employees who operate the processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving highly hazardous chemicals.  This safety information will be made readily available to those involved in the processes, and includes but is not limited to:\n1. Information pertaining to hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used in the process, and\n2. Information pertaining to the technology of the process."
