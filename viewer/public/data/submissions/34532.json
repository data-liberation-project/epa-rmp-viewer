The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain safely precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, heat=lth as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling prodedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response plant includes procedures for notification of the Mountain Home Fire Department, Johnny Moore (Water & Sewer Director), Mike Vincent (Water Plant Supervisor), Baxter County 911 System call out to affected population.  The Mountain Home Fire Department and Mountain Home Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with mounted PA announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Baxter County Offices of Emergency Services.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water system utilizing chemicals such as chlorine.  Chlorine is received in individual one ton cylinders at the 994 water plant road location and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the water system by automatic feeders.  All cylinders operate on a vacuum system.  This vacuum system will prevent the continual operation of the system if there is an increase or decrease in operating pressure on the cyliners or lines. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulatedsubstance handled at the 994 water plant road location is chlorine.

The emergency back-up cylinder system (4 @ 150 pound) is the only addition to this system.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last 5 years.. The automatic vacuum system limits the amount (if any) of chlorine that excapes during operational periods.."
