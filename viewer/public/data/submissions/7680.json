If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the county emergency 911 dispatcher. The dispatcher would request the Parshall Fire Dept. and Parshall Ambulance to respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail outlet for anhydrous ammonia fertilizer. The NH3 is purchased by area producers who in turn use it for agricultual production. The plant consists of two 30,000 gallon storage tanks and associated piping, valves,  and transfer hoses.\n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%) or 149,175 pounds. According to the EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles. The estimated residential population within this distance is 80.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations.\n\nNo additional measures are necessary to improve the safety of this facility."
