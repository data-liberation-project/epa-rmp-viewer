The differential pressure pushes the LPG from the tank cars or trucks into the storage vessels. \r\n\r\nThe propane stored in the three, 30,000-gallon, aboveground propane storage pressure vessels (see details below) is transferred to DOT-approved, LPG transportation trucks. Propane is transferred from the storage vessels to the delivery trucks by way of a liquid propane pump. Tanker truck capacity ranges from approximately 10,000 gallons (transport trucks) to 3,000 gallons (or less) for the bobtail-style, local delivery trucks. \r\n\r\nThe storage vessels are equipped with excess flow valves. The vessels are also protected by a manually-actuated, emergency shutdown system. The emergency shutdown system has been designed to provide a means to rapidly shut down equipment and to place the facility in a safe condition as quickly as possible in order to minimize the possibility of a catastrophic occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe Reno Terminal limits the volume of propane in the storage vessels to no more than 85% of the shell capacity.
