Kiva Energy contracted with Amec Foster Wheeler Environment and Infrastructure, Inc. (Amec Foster Wheeler) to develop a chemical accident prevention program to comply with the requirements of the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation and the Nevada State Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP). The Reno Terminal is covered by the Federal EPA RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68, and utilizes the inventory data, offsite consequence analysis, population estimates and other information contained the RMP Registration for compliance with the requirements of the State of Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) CAPP, NAC Sections 459,95321 through 459.9533 and NAC Sections 459.95348 through 459.95376.\n\n\n\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility staff are prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Emergency Response Plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Facility is a bulk, hydrocarbon storage and handling facility that receives LPG by rail cars and trucks. The LPG is stored in the facility's aboveground, storage tanks (pressure vessels) prior to being loaded into U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved delivery trucks (owned by Kiva Energy as well as third-party distributors). The three pressure vessels (PV17.01, PV17.02, and PV17.03) are manifolded (i.e., interconnected) and are operated as a single storage unit.\n\n\n\nA propane"

The differential pressure \"pushes\" the LPG from the tank cars or trucks into the storage vessels. \n\n\n\nThe propane stored in the three, 30,000-gallon, aboveground propane storage pressure vessels (see details below) is transferred to DOT-approved, LPG transportation trucks. Propane is transferred from the storage vessels to the delivery trucks by way of a liquid propane pump. Tanker truck capacity ranges from approximately 10,000 gallons (transport trucks) to 3,000 gallons (or less) for the bobtail-style, local delivery trucks. \n\n\n\nThe storage vessels are equipped with excess flow valves. The vessels are also protected by a manually-actuated, emergency shutdown system. The emergency shutdown system has been designed to provide a means to rapidly shut down equipment and to place the facility in a safe condition as quickly as possible in order to minimize the possibility of a catastrophic occurrence.\n\n\n\nThe Reno Terminal limits the volume of propane in the storage vessels to no more than 85% of the shell capacity. The net and aggregate volumes of storage vessels are as follows: \n\n\n\nVessel                        Vessel Capacity     Maximum Volume     Amount of Propane \n\nPV17.01-PV17.03           30,000 gals         25,500 gals            107,610 lbs\n\nNet PV17.01-PV17.03       90,000 gals         76,500 gals            322,830 lbs\n\n\n\nTotals                     90,000 gals         76,500 gals            322,830 lbs\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of propane present within the interconnected storage vessels is 322,830 lbs. This number represents that volume contained in the 3 storage pressure vessels (as described above). \n\n\n\nThe Reno Terminal is served by a rail siding. The rail siding is equipped with a derail to prevent cars from entering the adjacent rail line. The railcars are spotted by the railroad. The siding has capacity for up to five (5) "

At the assumed density of 4.22 lbs per gallon, that volume of propane has an approximate weight of 941,588 lbs. \n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for each of the regulated processes. The detailed results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Administrative controls limit the tank fill capacity to in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, Section 7.4.3.2(B).\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario is the release of propane from three (3) storage pressure vessels when filled to the greatest amount. The scenario assumes a complete release of 322,830 pounds of propane gas. The pressure wave (with an endpoint of 1 pound per square inch gauge over atmospheric pressure) would extend 0.6 miles (0.96 kilometers). The pressure wave could reach nearby industrial business located to the north of the site. There are no sensitive receptors within this blast zone.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  The alternative release scenario based on the hazard review (or a more plausible potential incident) is a catastrophic release from a full-sized (10,000 gallon water capacity), tanker truck.

These documents address chemical properties. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure. Treatment considerations is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\nKiva Energy also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the safe normal operations and emergency shutdown of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.\n\n\n\nThe most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered processes took place on October 6, 2017. \n\n\n\nHazard Review:  Kiva Energy conducted a hazard review of the operations at the Reno Terminal. The hazard review employed the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOPS) methodology and a Checklist method analysis. The plant operator and operations management identified and evaluated hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team made recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe most recent, complete update of the hazard review was conducted on February 13, 2018. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  The Reno Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as:\n\n(1) start-up, "
