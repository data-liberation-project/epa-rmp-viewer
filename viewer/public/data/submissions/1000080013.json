The OxyChem Convent facility began operations in 1981, operates with 120 employees, and produces chlorine, caustic soda, hydrogen, and ethylene dichloride.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (A? 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Convent facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  Part of this commitment includes the establishment of systems for the safe operation of processes to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and the development of emergency response policies to respond to emergency situations which at a minimum are consistent with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (A? 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Convent facility consists of several chemical production units that are wholly owned and operated by OxyChem.  The facility conducted a threshold determination consistent with 40 CFR 68.115 and has identified one substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP): Chlorine (CAS Number 7782-50-5).\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (A? 68.155(d))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Convent facilityA?s prevention program has been prepared to be consistent with OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The siteA?s prevention program is documented, routinely reviewed, updated as necessary, and addresses several elements including:\n\n\n\n  Process Safety Information\n\n  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n  Operating Procedures\n\n  Training\n\n  Mechanical Integrity\n\n  Management of Change\n\n  Pre-Startup Review\n\n  Compliance Audits\n\n  Incident Investigation\n\n  Employee Participation\n\n  Key Procedures"

All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and periodic in-plant drills are conducted.  The drills are used to gauge the response time of the Emergency Response Team, the accuracy of the plant employee accountability program, and the mobilization of the plant's Emergency Command Center.  In addition, the OxyChem Convent facility has developed a Special Situations Plan for responding to emergencies which may impact areas beyond the immediate plant boundaries.  This plan is a supplement of and complement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a member of the St. James Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee, which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (A? 68.155(g))\n\n\n\nThe OxyChem Convent facility continually works to improve safety through annual reviews of our plant process safety information, investigations of near misses and incidents, by soliciting feedback on safety and environmental issues from all facility employees, and through continued support of OSHAA?s Voluntary Protection Program as a VPP Star Worksite.\n\n\n\nCertification Statement\n\n\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided through eSubmit                                                   Steve Welch\n\n--------------------------------------------------                          ----------------------------------------------------\n\nSignature                                                             "
