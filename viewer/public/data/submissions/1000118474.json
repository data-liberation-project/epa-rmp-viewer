SAA trains and qualifies its personnel to properly engage in activities related to the usage and storage of chlorine; this includes its distribution system which is used in the manufacturing of aluminum products. All new-hired SAA employees attend Chlorine Safety Training during pre-employment orientation, which includes instruction on chlorine properties, hazards, and the use of chlorine in SAA's manufacturing processes. In addition, numerous employees are selected to participate in 24-hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training. SAA believes that the HAZWOPER training provides employees with advanced understanding for responding and coordinating emergencies involving hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine. Each operating shift is staffed with personnel trained in HAZWOPER to ensure adequate coverage during operational hours. HAZWOPER training records are kept up-to-date and on-file within the onsite Safety Office. Employees will be retrained on an annual basis and participate in routine table talk discussions, reviews, and evaluations that cover various aspects of the facilities emergency response, process equipment and operations, which is currently being implemented as an additional Best Management Practice (BMP) initiative.\n\nFacility description and the regulated substances handled:\n\nSAA is a Secondary Aluminum processing facility that manufactures several aluminum products. Chlorine gas is used in SAA's manufacturing processes as a fluxing agent to reduce magnesium levels and remove impurities. Chlorine gas is injected and distributed throughout a mo"

Chlorine is distributed through a piping system to a series of vaporizers prior to being directed to one of five furnaces. SAA maintains an inventory of no more than thirty-nine (39) one-ton cylinders, eight (8) of which are connected to the distribution system located within the chlorine room equipped with monitoring and detection systems.  Cylinders not connected to the distribution system are stored within a locked fenced-in rack system outside of the distribution room. Chlorine is the only substance handled at the facility that is currently regulated under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), Section 112(r) Risk Management Planning Requirements. Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is designated as a regulated toxic substance under the U.S. EPA provisions for chemical accident prevention (40 CFR Part 68) with a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds. Since the facility stores chlorine in excess of the applicable threshold, SAA is required to prepare and submit an RMP and comply with the requirements presented in 40 CFR Part 68, as authorized by the CAAA, Section 112(r). SAA's chlorine-based programs and processes are required to meet 40 CFR Part 68 Program 3 requirements because the worst case off-site consequence analysis shows a potential impact to offsite populations and receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps: \n\nSAA is required to comply with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable codes and regulations.  A Process Safety and Risk Management Plan (PS & RMP) has been developed and implemented to define the steps necessary to ensure prevention of a chlorine release through engineering and administrative controls.\n\nThe Five-year Accident History: \n\nThrough the continuous implementation, inspection, and evaluation of t"

SAA maintains a staff of employees certified with 24-Hour HAZWOPER training and as On-Scene Incident Commanders. These individuals are trained and qualified to respond to chemical release emergencies. Annual training is conducted for HAZWOPER and internal emergency action plans in order to ensure that all employees are educated to take the appropriate actions in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: \n\nTo ensure employee participation and involvement, SAA implements routine table talks specific to HAZWOPER and Emergency Response, which includes evaluating and reviewing aspects of the facilities PS & RMP."
