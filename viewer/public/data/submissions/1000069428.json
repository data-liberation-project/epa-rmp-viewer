Pioneer Parkway, Arlington, Texas 76010.  The facility will engage in loading, unloading, storing, mixing and blending of various raw materials including liquids and powders to manufacture coatings.  The facility uses Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) (TDI) (CAS # 264171-62-5) in the production of polymers.  TDI will be stored in excess of the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds set forth in 40 CFR 68.130. Polycoat Products will be extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and will be very diligent about safety for its employees and its neighbors. Polycoat Products staff will be well trained and will utilize modern equipment to provide safeguards. The TDI storage tank and transfer system, that will contain the regulated substance Toluene diisocyanate (TDI), will be used for supplying TDI to the polymer production reactors in the process area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nPolycoat Products, LLC. - Arlington, TX will implement precautions like engineering controls and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment when handling TDI and associated equipment. In order to prevent accidental release of the chemical from various sources a policy to check the equipment regularly will be implemented. , that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operations at the facility.\r\nPolycoat Products will have Risk Management Program in place to manage the handling, loading and transfer of TDI. The program will include requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, and periodic review or audit of program elements. Written procedures will be developed as part of this program that specifies the steps for every task"

The tank is used as a stationary tank at this site. All piping attached to the tank; penetrate tank boundaries from the top. TDI is received in bulk by a tank truck. The truck is parked outside and the transfer is done by hoses connected to the truck at unloading rack. During the course of the unloading operation, the vapor space of the storage tank is forced through the scrubber units. Therefore, no TDI vapors are released during this operation. In addition to the double wall feature, the storage tank is set inside a containment area within the building at the facility to minimize the impacts of a release from the tank. The dimensions of the containment are 28'8 length X 14'4 wide X 3'4 height with sufficient volume to contain the entire contents of the tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nFacility will have an accident release prevention program in place following to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.
