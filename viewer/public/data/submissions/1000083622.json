      "SummaryText": "In the preceding RMP, an evaluation of the catastrophic loss and the more probable alternatives have been evaluated using the RMP Software provided by EPA.  Brainerd Chemical Co., Inc. has three chemicals on site that have exceeded the threshold limits and are subject to RMP.  These chemicals are 37% Formaldehyde, 99% Nitric Acid and 70% Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\n\n\nIt is expected that the worst case release of Formaldehyde would be from one of the tanks that is located outside.  (Note that there are four tanks containing 13,500 pounds each and a single tank containing 80,000 pounds.)  The worst case scenario shows that the toxic endpoint would be located approximately 0.1 miles from the facility.  It should be noted that the tanks are each in a secondary containment area and the most likely loss to the environment would be a hose or valve failure, resulting in the loss.  The largest tank is located in a three sided building, which provides protection from the elements, and would likely result in a smaller impact to the surrounding community.    \n\n\n\nA release of Hydrofluoric Acid is expected to pose less of a risk as it is only present in drums.  Since the last submission, the facility has eliminated the repackaging operation of this chemical and merely stores the product pending resale.  Therefore, the largest amount that can be released at one time is 30 gallons.\n\n\n\nThe facility has increased its inventory of 99% Nitric Acid, and is now required to include that chemical in this plan.  There are two processes - the first is the off-loading of Nitric Acid from the tanker to the storage tank and the second is the filling of both 15-gallon and 30-gallon drums with 99% Nitric Acid.  As a matter of practice, only certain persons are permitted to participate in this process or even be in the area when the process is in operation.  The process is operated by two people at a time and employs a redundant system of checks between the employees before the process is even begun.  Whe"

      "SummaryText": "n the Nitric Acid is off-loaded from the truck, the driver remains in the truck and the unloading is done exclusively by trained Brainerd employees. \n\n\n\nOnce the tanker truck arrives, it must pass through security and is directed to the part of the facility where the Nitric Acid storage tank is located.  The area is evacuated except for the personnel that are directly related to this process.  The tanker truck is connected to the tank through a special product line.  (There are two tanks holding Nitric Acid, but only one is being filled at a time and the two tanks do not run \"in parallel\".  Because of this, when the loading or unloading operation is discussed, only one tank is mentioned.)  The line is located in a separate part of the facility than the other lines that go to other product tanks.  Further, this line has a unique fitting which will only connect to the tanker and Nitric Acid tank.  The tanker is chocked to ensure that it does not move and the driver remains in the cab.  The Nitric Acid is forced from the tanker using plant air, which is connected to the tanker and has a pressure of approximately 7 psi.  Generally, the flow rate is extremely slow to prevent a loss of product.\n\n \n\nIn the second process, the Nitric Acid flows out of the tank and is gravity fed into a 15-gallon or 30-gallon drum.   During the filling process, the filling area is isolated and the drum is positioned on a scale which is used to determine the quantity of the product in the drum.  Further, the drum is located in an over pack drum that contains an inert packing material along the bottom of the drum, three strands of packing material along the sides (for stability) and material along the top of the drum.  There is a vapor recovery line attached to the drum on the vent side that directs residual vapor or overflow to a scrubber unit.  After the filling process is complete, the drum and over pack are sealed and the drum is ready for shipment.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in an area of"

There are residences in these areas that are projected to be affected by any of the evaluated releases from this facility.  In the event of a release, these areas would have to be notified.  The contingency plan currently states that the radio stations and emergency responders would be notified.  This plan also contains the telephone numbers to the schools that are also located in the area.\n\n\n\nIt has also been learned that there is sufficient quantity of 37% Formaldehyde and 99% Nitric Acid on site to require the facility to engage in Process Safety Management, thus making the facility a Level 3 PSM Program.  The facility has concluded a HAZOP on each of the affected process.  There were few operations hazards identified.  The written programs required by PSM regulations, and thus also by RMP regulations, have been implemented at the facility.  There is a sufficient quantity of Hydrofluoric Acid on site to trigger reporting, but there is no process - merely storage.  Therefore, this chemical is reported on a Level 2 Program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents in the past five years. And therefore no incident investigation has been conducted.  The only contractors on site are drivers which transport the bulk product on site.  These contractors are trained as to Brainerd?s procedures for loading and unloading those materials.  This training is conducted by their employers, who certify the training has been successfully completed.  Due to the fact that the facility's structures and piping are mostly constructed of PVC or other similar materials, there is no reason for the facility to develop a Hot Work Program.  "
