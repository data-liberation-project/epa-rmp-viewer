      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that EC Phillips is complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (called PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and the EPA Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels that are interconnected, and separate vessels that are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a release, shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThis facility has been occupied by several owners, and portions of it are quite old. Documentation on the original design for some of these older parts is no longer available, but the original design and additions were carried out by contractors of long standing in the field of ammonia refrigeration.\n\nThere is one compressor room on the main floor near the plant entrance. This is a single stage system consisting five screw compressors, with evaporative condensers located on the roof above, draining to two high pre"

The evaporation (low pressure) part of the system is mostly by pumped liquid ammonia, with two low pressure receivers, one on each floor. The evaporators themselves consist of a number of blast freezer coils, air units with fans, flake ice makers, serpentine pipe coils, and a shell/tube brine chiller.\n\nWith the long term goal of reducing the inventory of ammonia, some of the serpentine pipe coils are gradually being replaced with fan units.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases in the last five (nor previous five) years.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program relies on standard operating procedures, extensive maintenance, and employee training. All areas of the system are protected by relief valves that discharge to atmosphere well above the building roof. The system is monitored by several ammonia detectors in the compressor room and other key areas. The plant is monitored at night by an outside security firm. The detectors have a threshold level alarm to notify plant operators of small leaks, and a higher level alarm for starting emergency ventilation and phoning out to key personnel; the dialer is to be installed shortly.\n\nThere are some planned changes to the system resulting from 1) recommendations in the revalidation PHA conducted in December 2009, 2) replacement of an aging condenser, and 3) the ongoing goal of reducing the ammonia inventory.\n\nThe undersigned certifies that to my best knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nPaul Cyr\nGeneral Manager\nDate: 12-16-09  \n"
