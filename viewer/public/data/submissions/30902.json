The disinfection process is covered under this regulation at the Jefferson \n\nParish West Bank Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  \n\nThis document contains information on the chlorine systems at the West Jefferson Water \n\nTreatment Plant that may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and \n\nmaintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled \n\nwith the current mitigation systems, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the \n\nsurrounding community.\n\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These \n\ntwo programs have been incorporated into both initial and recurring training.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the \n\nchlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. Because the West Bank \n\nWTP is located in a residential neighborhood and is not subject to OSHA programs, the West \n\nBank WTP is categorized in Risk Management Program Level II.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario is defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being \n\nreleased by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration and includes the passive mitigation \n\nrelated to the chlorine building.  A mitigation factor of 0.32 was determined for the chlorine \n\nbuilding using the EPA's Wastewater Treatment Plants Risk Management Program Guidance \n\ndocument.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 0.5 miles at the 3 ppm toxic \n\nendpoint concentration specified by EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person \n\nmay be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative "

      "SummaryText": "Release Scenario of chlorine was based on a fusible plug release from an \n\noverfilled1-ton cylinder containing 2350 lbs with a release rate of 437 lbs/minute, applying both \n\npassive and active mitigation of the chlorine building and the recently installed 1-ton chlorine \n\nscrubbers. A total release of 2350 lbs of chlorine was assumed in this alternative scenario.  The \n\ntoxic end point for the Alternative Release Scenario was determined to be 0.0 miles with all \n\nchlorine gas remaining inside the chlorine building and scrubber system with no release to the \n\nenvironment.  This was based on a 2400 SCFM chlorine gas release rate and a 3000 SCFM \n\nscrubber exhaust rate that maintained the chlorine building under negative pressure during the \n\nentire period of the release.  It should be noted that this Alternative Release Scenario release \n\nrate of 437 lbs/minute is 2.2 times greater than the Worst Case Scenario required by Risk \n\nManagement Program, described above.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History - Chlorine\n\nNo releases have been documented in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nManagement Program\n\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the \n\ndevelopment, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The \n\nProgram requires that a Compliance Audit to certify compliance with RMP Accident Prevention \n\nprovisions at least every three years.  In addition, a revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) must \n\nbe submitted to EPA every 5 years (within 5 years of the previous submission) or within 6 \n\nmonths of a change that results in a revised process hazard assessment or hazard review, or \n\nthat requires a revised offsite consequence analysis.  The Document Management System is \n\nlargely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, comprised of the Water Purification \n\nSuperintendent II, the Water Plant Maintenance Superintendent, Pump Equipment Mechanic, \n\nand Water Quality Scientist IV.
