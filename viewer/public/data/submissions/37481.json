              "Description": "Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products, Inc. has an accident prevention plan for this Klingerstown plant that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act?s (OSHA), Process Safety Management Standard and EPA?s Risk Management Program Regulation.  The plant did not fall under 10,000 lbs threshold anhydrous ammonia until the completion of a recent expansion in the fall of 1998.  The only covered chemical(s) contained on our site in quantities covered by the above regulations is anhydrous ammonia.  The introduction of the PSM and RMP programs began in early Jan. 1999 and since then the programs have been adopted into one on-going management process that includes members of management, productionand operational/maintenance staff.  The Prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n?-  Employee Paticipation Program\n?-  Process Safety Management\n?-  Process Hazard Analysis\n?-  Operating Procedures\n?-  Training Programs\n?-  Contractor Safety Program\n?-  Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n?-  Mechanical Integrity Program\n?-  Hot Work Permit Procedures\n?-  Management of Change Procedures\n?-  Incident Investigation Procedures\n?-  Compliance Audit Precedures\n\nThe program has been reviewed with the Klingerstown Fire Department and Count HAZMAT teams.  Suggestions by these outside agencies have been warmly received and incorporated where feasible.",

Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nMichael Foods is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes\nelements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\npoints in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\nrefrigeration system to identify the\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\nof the refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are\nscreened to verify that they are within the original safe design\nlimits.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we\nconduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new\nequipment has been designed and installed properly.\n- Contractors: We car"
