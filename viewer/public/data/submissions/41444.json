Raw materials received in drum and bulk quantities are batch blended and packaged for sale. Both liquid and aerosol products are produced.  Facility SIC Code is 2899.  TCC is strongly committed to employee and community safety.  The facility's design features and operational procedures are intended to eliminate or minimize the chance of unauthorized releases of hazardous chemicals into the workplace or the environment.\n\nThe regulated chemicals utilized by this facility are butane, propane, and ethyl ether.  The butane and propane are utilized in a mixture as a propellant gas for aerosol products.  Ethyl ether is used in certain product formulations in mixtures with the propellant.  Primary elements of the propane/butane propellant and ethyl ether systems include bulk storage tanks, transfer pumps, blend tanks, aerosol charging stations, and the associated piping.\n\nThe aerosol propellant gas is stored onsite in a tank.  The maximum quantity onsite is 114,000 lbs.  The design and construction of the tank, pump, and transfer system is in accordance with applicable rules and guidelines of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Liquid Petroleum Gas Division of the Texas Railroad Commission, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The system is monitored and operated by employees of Technical Chemical Company who have been trained in facility safe operating procedures and the facility emergency response procedures.  Ethyl ether is also stored onsite in a tank.  This tank is designed in accordance with accepted industry standards including ASME codes for pressure vessels.\n\nPropellant and ether are mixed in a closed pressure vessel system and then transferred via welded piping to the filling/charging operation.  The charging operation is continuously monitored by area detect"

      "SummaryText": "ors which are designed to identify the presence of explosive gas in the atmosphere.  At 20% of the atmospheric lower explosive limit (LEL), these detectors activate an emergency ventilation system.  At 40% of the atmospheric LEL, these detectors shut down aerosol charging and transfer activity and isolate the tank.  The system is equipped with automatic and manual emergency shutdowns at the bulk tank location, and there is a fire suppression system located in the aerosol charging area.  The facility has developed procedures for unloading aerosol propellant gas, and for operation and maintenance of the system to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  The release prevention program for the system incorporates the elements required by OSHA 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).\n\nThe facility emergency response plan includes notification and alarm procedures to evacuate the facility and notify the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), and the National Response Center (NRC) in the event of an accidental release, as required by regulation.  The facility conducts employee training and drills in the emergency procedures periodically.  The facility is inspected annually by the local fire department.  No significant releases of regulated chemicals have been experienced by the facility in the five years previous to this submittal."
