This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that facility management invests in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Amoco Polymers, Inc. plant is located at 7139 Augusta Road, Greenville, South Carolina.  The plant is owned by BP Amoco Chemical Company.  Various chemicals are processed to produce carbon fibers and resins for use in the aerospace industry and in sporting goods.  For example, carbon fiber is a strong, light-weight material that when used to replace metal in aircraft results in reduce fuel usage while maintaining a secure, safe structure.  \n\nThe regulated substance at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity is acrylonitrile.  Acrylonitrile is stored in an atmospheric tank and is charged to low pressure, low temperature reactors where it is converted to acrylic polymer suitable for spinning and converting to carbon fiber.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nThe toxic worst case scenario (WSC) for the plant is a ten minute release of acrylonitrile from the acryonitrile storage tank.  The worst case endpoint is based on releasing the entire contents of the acrylonitrile storage tank as described in the EPA Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidance.  The effects of "

      "SummaryText": "administrative controls, active mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in the determination of the endpoint.  The passive mitigation considered is the concrete dike around the tank that limits the exposed surface area of a pool which reduces the the release rate and the distance to the endpoint.  Nearby public receptors could be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile assumes a 30 minute release duration from a piping leak which was modeled and calculated based on the SLAB model.  The extent of the release will be mitigated by early detection through a gas chromatograph detection system, a dike around the tank, and vapor suppression with foam.  The distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint is such that the release may leave the plant boundaries unless the available mitigation systems, both passive and active, are implemented.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan. \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis team.  \n\nEmployees have access to all information created as part of the plant prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participatio"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.  One initiative is the B-Safe Program, which is a behavior based safety system, in which all employees participate in developing safe work habits.  After a work group has successfully integrated a targeted safe work practice into a habit that is always followed, the group celebrates their success.  \n\nAlso, each work group participates in monthly safety meetings.  Members from a work group are responsible for determining the topics and then presenting the information to their co-workers.  Topics range from safety issues off-the-job to safety issues in the workplace.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  There is documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  \n\nFor process areas. the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).

In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe HAZOP team?s recommendations are reviewed with management for approval.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: \n(1) unit startup, \n(2) normal operations, \n(3) temporary operations, \n(4) emergency shutdown, \n(5) normal shutdown, and \n(6) initial startup of a new process.  \n\nThese procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nThe  plant has many safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (3) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \n\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: \n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and \n(6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with: \n(1) a process overview, \n(2) information about safety and health hazards, \n(3) emergency response plan requirements, and \n(4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  \n\nIn addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance duri"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  \n\nThis review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team is composed of process and project engineers, maintenance and operations personnel as well as health, safety, and environment personnel.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:\n(1) conducting training, \n(2) developing written procedures and plans, \n(3) performing inspections and tests, \n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and \n(5) applying quality assurance measures.  \n\nIn combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: \n(1) an overview of the process, \n(2) safety and health hazards, \n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n(4) emergency response plans, and \n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensu"

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant has a hot work permit program which is facilitated through the plant's hazardous work program.  The hazardous work program describes those areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc. except in designated free burn areas.  \n\nThe procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hazardous work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hazardoust work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility chang"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Any changes to chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated and documented.  \n\nIn addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nThe investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  \n\nThe final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  \n\nBoth hourly "

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports along with the resolution of findings are retained.  \n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Greenville BP Amoco Polymers plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the Program 3 EPA RMP covered process at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Greenville plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in our processes:  \n\nRelease Detection:\n\n1. Acrylonitrile detectors set at the OSHA TLV with alarms\n2. Acrylonitrile relief valve opening alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n2. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (i.e. high level, high temperature)\n3. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n4. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n5. Process vent/Incineration system for capturing and destroying vapors\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n2. Foam system for vapor suppression\n3. Trained emergency response personnel\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n5. Integrated relationship with the Donaldson Center HAZ"
