In addition, it is required to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management Regulation.\r\n\r\nOur process safety management program requires a systematic whole process approach to release prevention. It includes a properly designed system, well defined maintenance and operating procedures, adequately trained employees, emergency and/or release mitigation backup systems in place.\r\n\r\nOSHA'S Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation final rule issued February 24, 1992 with an effective date of May 26, 1992.  It includes a compliance with same provisions and was extended from May 26, 1992 until August 26, 1992.\r\n\r\nThe regulation is the outgrowth of a need perceived by OSHA for regulatory provisions to minimize or eliminate catastrophic major incidents in industries processing and handling Highly Hazardous Chemicals. The regulation builds on recommended process safety practices developed by the American Petroleum Institute and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. It also considers input from numerous operating companies, trade associations and professional organizations.\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITIES\r\n\r\nThe plant manager is responsible for implementing the Process Safety Management Regulations, at the Texas City Plant. He will respond and submit all required documentation and reports in accordance with OSHA 11910.119.\r\n\r\n1.\tGOALS AND BENEFITS OF PSM AND PSM DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\nThe first goal of PSM is to take appropriate steps at the right time to prevent incidents to protect life, property, and the environment. Preventive maintenance programs, training programs, and Management of Change (MOC) have all been developed to help achieve this goal. PHA is conducted not only in the project phase of"

When incidents do occur, investigations are conducted, corrective actions are proposed, and modifications are made to prevent further occurrences. The likelihood of success of these and other PSM, efforts is enhanced by, or in some cases is dependent upon, accurate, effective documentation.\r\n \r\nIt may not be possible to prevent every incident. Thus, the second goal of PSM is to minimize the hazardous consequences of incidents that do occur. For example, during a process upset, the pressure in a reactor may exceed the design pressure; therefore, relief systems are provided to restrict the pressure to a safe level by discharging a portion of the reactor's contents. However, the hazardous discharge must be directed safely to prevent serious injury or damage resulting from the operation of the protective device. The objectives of each of these stages of protection is documented via design drawings, operating procedures, maintenance procedures and training requirements. This documentation enables the many people who may be involved with the reactor system (e.g., operations, maintenance, process control, or engineering personnel) to be more fully aware of the operational requirements of the equipment and of their responsibilities. This reduces the likelihood that the protections are compromised during the operating life of the facility.\r\n\r\nThe third goal of PSM is to enhance compliance with industry initiatives such as the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care program or the American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 750, and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation of procedures and audit results enhances the confidence of the public, and of regulatory bodies, that industry is being a good corporate citizen.\r\n\r\nAmong the many benefits of good and comprehensive process safety documentation are the followin"

Supporting this principal goal are more specific goals to:\r\n\u00bf\testablish a corporate culture in support of the PSM effort;\r\n\u00bf\tprovide perspective on the scope of the PSM program; and\r\n\u00bf\tdemonstrate management support.\r\n\r\nWell-documented accountabilities must be established for each management function; planning, organizing, implementing, and controlling. The benefit to be obtained from documented accountabilities is to ensure that the PSM system accomplishes each of these management functions.\r\n\r\n2.3\tDescription of Documentation\r\n\r\nTo effectively manage PSM, there is a documented program outlining the overall objectives and describing how they is achieved. Specific objectives which is considered for documentation include:\r\n\u00bf\tcontinuity of operations;\r\n\u00bf\tcontinuity of systems;\r\n\u00bf\tcontinuity of organization;\r\n\u00bf\tcontrol of exceptions and variances;\r\n\u00bf\tmanagement accessibility;\r\n\u00bf\temployee involvement;\r\n\u00bf\tcommunications; and\r\n\u00bf\treduction in incidents, injuries, and property losses.\r\n\r\nSpecific instructions for how PSM is to be implemented and how these goals are to be achieved are typically described in a system of documents beginning with a general statement of PSM values and policies and concluding with detailed procedures. These increasingly detailed documentation requirements are discussed further in this section.\r\n\r\n2.4\tStatement of Values and Policies\r\n\r\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of an organization is typically the sponsor or advocate of process safety and leads by example. In this role, the CEO usually issues a statement articulating the organization's values and describing in simple but direct terms what the organization expects to achieve through PSM. The statement"

Valves do not constitute isolation of connectivity, but blinds or spool pieces do disconnect inventories of high hazardous chemicals. Also, there are no minimum times for connections to be in place for processes or equipment to be considered interconnected.

Organizations conduct audits to determine the status of existing systems, to identify what needs improvement, and to avoid potential incidents. Auditing helps establish management control of the PSM elements and helps meet the following objectives:\r\n\u00bf\timproves the performance of the function being audited;\r\n\u00bf\tmeasures result and permits trend analysis;      \r\n\u00bf\treinforces accountability, based on audit findings;\r\n\u00bf\tfacilitates compliance with internal guidelines and governmental regulations; and,\r\n\u00bf\tcommunicates the results to affected audiences. There are several types of audit that is described below.\r\n \r\n2.2.\tTypes of Audits\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the various audits are different, and sometimes require different approaches. Three principal types are briefly described in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nMAI Systems Audit. This type of audit consists of a careful review of the systems involved in the management of the PSM elements. Basically, it is a confirmation check that procedures and practices exist. Verification activities should include checking to see than\r\n\u00bf\tdocumentation is adequate and used effectively (a sampling approach may be necessary);\r\n\u00bf\tresources (personnel and otherwise) are sufficient;\r\n\u00bf\taudit schedules are being met; and responses to problems are timely.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Audits. This audit type is generally more detailed and specific than a PSM systems audit. Process safety audits seek to verify that the actual practices are in accordance with established procedures.
