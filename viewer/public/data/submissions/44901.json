      "SummaryText": "Occidental Permian Ltd's. Welch CO2 Gas Process Facility has previously been registered as a facility covered by 40 CFR 68 (EPA Facility ID# 1000 0004 6746).  In compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68 a risk management plan was developed and implemented for the facility.  This plan was submitted to EPA as required and then recertified in June, 2004.  In November 2005 a letter was submitted to EPA announcing the de-registation of the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility due to the reduced inventory of all regulated substances below threshold quantities.  This reduction was made possible by the partial unloadng of the facility by redirecting gas load to another facility.  The effective date of the deregulation was 12/19/2005.  Unexpected increases in the gas load now requires that the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility gas load be maintained at a near the original volumes.  This causes the quantities of certain covered material to be maintained at levels above the threshold quantities necessary to require compliance with 40 CFR 68.  For that reason this plan is being submitted for the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergecny \n\nOccidental Permian Ltd's. Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the uses of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent release or regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\n\nDescription of the Stati"

      "SummaryText": "onary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility is to provide CO2 for injection into oil formations, thus enhancing oil recovery.  The plant includes facilities for compressing, sweetening, treating, dehydrating and separating the gas.  The plant contains several regulated flammables, including methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane.  In addition, the gas plant processes hydrogen sufide (H2S), also a regulated substance, but not in an amount above the threshold quantity for H2S.  The plant sales a process stream of natural gas liquids.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with the flammable mix inventory being the source of our worst case scenario.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWelch CO2 Gas Processing Facility qualifies as a Program Level 1 facility and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nReview of the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility incident records of the past five years, found that Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility has not experiences an accidental release with off-site impact, from a covered process resulting in death, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWelch CO2 Gas Processing Facility maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposure.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after evacuation, and not"

      "SummaryText": "ification of local emergency response agencies.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact in the RMP plan.\n\n\nPlanning Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.  We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility incidents.\n2.  We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental plants.\n3.  We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\n\n\nCertification\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario for the flammable mix inventory is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nWithin the past five years the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility process has had no accidental release that caused off-site impacts provided in 40 CFR 68.10 (b)(1).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP plan.  The undersigned cerifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSignature:  John Dorow\n\nTitle:  Production Coordinator\n\nDate:  January 7, 2005"
