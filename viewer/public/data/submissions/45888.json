Maldonado\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention - Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAble Electropolishing is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.0 Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAble Electropolishing specializes in the electropolishing of mostly stainless steel parts for functional and decorative purposes.  We have (1) RMP regulated substance present at our facility subject to Risk Management Planning.  This substance is anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2), a compressed gas that is injected into the wastewater treatment system, used for treating hexavalent chromium in our wastewater from electropolishing operations.  SO2 is an efficient reducing chemical in treating the wastewater for chromium down to our regulated effluent limits prior to discharging the water to sewer.\n\n\n\n3.0 Worst-Case Release Scenario & Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide that would be released at our facility is 2000 pounds.  The sulfur dioxide we use comes in 1-Ton cylinders that compress and liquefy the sulfur dioxide under pressure for use in the wastewater treatment system.  According to USEPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants using SO2, failure of a cy"

      "SummaryText": "linder containing 2000 lbs. of SO2 produces a scenario within a 1.3-mile distance to the endpoint.  However, this worst-case scenario release is unlikely due to the controls Able Electropolishing Co., Inc. has in place. The alternate release scenario at Able Electropolishing Co., Inc. has been based on a release scenario from piping/manifold failure at a valve, joint, or seal.  Using USEPA's Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants using SO2, this type of release produces a scenario within a 1,060-foot distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nThere are two (2) cylinders on-line for our wastewater treatment system.  These cylinders are isolated from each other by check valves and stainless steel ball valves.  The system is designed to operate with one cylinder discharging and the other cylinder in reserve.  There is a solenoid valve downstream from the cylinder(s) that is connected to a number of emergency shut-off switches located throughout the facility.  In the event of a failure of the SO2 delivery system, these switches will cause the solenoid valves to automatically close and stop the flow of gas from the cylinder.  In addition, there is a check valve down stream of the solenoid valve that will prevent the flow of SO2 in the line from reversing.  These are just a few of the number of emergency shut-off procedures we have for the safe use of SO2 at Able Electropolishing Co., Inc.  These practices are very important to our release prevention program.  Additionally, we comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule, which means that safe handling and usage procedures of the SO2 are regularly reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\n5.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAble Electropolishing Co., Inc. has been at this location for ten (10) years.  In that time, there have been no accidental releases of sulfur dioxide. \n\n\n\nDocument No:\n\nMN000-014\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary \n\nRev"

Annually, a list of all regulated substances, the hazards associated with those substances, the maximum quantity on-site at the facility, their locations, and emergency response personnel phone numbers are submitted to the LEPC and the Chicago Fire Department by March 1 of every year.  In addition, all employees are trained regularly on emergency actions such as spill control & countermeasure, and evacuations.  Able Electropolishing Co., Inc. Emergency Action Team is trained at least annually on detection and response to sulfur dioxide leaks and leak (kit) repair.\n\n  \n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAble Electropolishing Co., Inc. plans on conducting its annual employee training sessions for this program each September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRev.\n\nDate\n\nChanges\n\nIssued by:\n\nApp. by:\n\nOrig.\n\n01/24/05\n\n---------\n\nDon Esser\n\nA.
