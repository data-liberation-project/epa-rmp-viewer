For example, off-loading evolutions, the most likely time for an accidental release, are conducted by a trained driver and monitored at the loading area by an MEF Operator and in the Control Room by the lead Operator on shift.  The two Operators are in constant radio communication and should a problem occur, the Control Room Operator makes outside calls for notification or assistance as appropriate.  Should a release occur, notification of the County Emergency Services organization using \"911\" activates response team personnel.\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nAs an electric power plant, our primary activity is the generation of electric power for the grid.  We have one reportable process at this facility, anhydrous ammonia is stored and used to control gas turbine and duct burner NOx emissions.  The maximum inventory of this material is 40,242 lbs.\n\n(c) The Worst Case Release and Alternate Case Scenarios:\nWe have used the assumptions and models provided by EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Program, RMP*Comp(tm) for the following two scenarios.\n\nThe worse case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The scenario assumes 40,242 lbs of ammonia are released as a gas in 10 minutes.  No passive or active mitigation controls come into play during the release.  Under worse case conditions, the maximum distance of 3.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario also involves a catastrophic release from the ammonia system, this time during a transferfrom a 6000 gallon delivery truck to the storage tank.  It is assumed that the hose fails "

      "SummaryText": "and neither the driver nor the monitor are able to shut down the pump or shut off the delivery valve.  Ammonia is released at a rate of 500 gallons per minute and no passive or active controls come into play.  Under these conditions, the maximum distance is 0.4 miles for a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\n(d) The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThis facility was designed and built in accordance with the latest codes and requirements when construction took place including the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling system.  In addition, a sprinkler system was installed in 1995 to allow the \"knock-down\" of any ammonia gas released in the vacinity of the storage tank.\n\nThe following parameters addressing release prevention are discussed in more detail in the facility's Process Safety Management Plan:\n     -Formal operating procedures.\n    -Operating limits.\n    -Health and safety considerations.\n    -Safety systems\n    -Safe work practices\n    -Contractor control.\n    -Mechanical integrity\n\n(e)The Five-year Accident History:\nNo accidents involving ammonia have occurred in the last five years.\n\n(f)The Emergency Response Program:\nThe employees are expected to be able to isolate systems and initiate the sprinkler system if ammonia concentrations caused by a release permit; they are also trained to deal with very minor leaks which can be contained and neutralized.  However, MEF employees will not respond to major ammonia releases other than to report the release to the St Lawrence County LEPC who will provide emergency response personnel and conduct appropriate notifications.\n\n(g) Planned changes to improve safety:\nNew York State regulations which cover storage tanks for hazardous materials, including those for anhydrous ammonia,  require a five year material inspection by the end of 1999.  MEF expects to complete this inspection in October 1999.\n\nMEF has submitted a draft CAA Title V permit which has been accepted as being administratively correct and which has been pr"
