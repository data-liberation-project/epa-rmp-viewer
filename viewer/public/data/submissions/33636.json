      "SummaryText": "FMC CORPORATION\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS GROUP\nBALTIMORE, MARYLAND\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nIn an effort to proactively inform the community of changes occurring at the facility, the FMC Corporation, Agricultural Products Group (APG) Baltimore Plant has prepared this revised Risk Management Plan (RMP) for resubmission to the EPA.  This is the Baltimore Plant's second revision since the original submission date in June 1999.  The changes incorporated in this revision reflect the removal of a previously reported process and its associated chemical inventory.  The Baltimore Plant no longer manufactures trimethyl orthoacetate (TMOA) and as a result, the inventory of anhydrous hydrogen chloride (AHCl) stored onsite has decreased substantially.  This reduction in chemical inventory changes the plant's worst-case toxic release scenario reported previously.  This means that AHCl is no longer available onsite in sufficient quantity to represent the plant's worst-case scenario for the release of a toxic chemical, as defined in the EPA's guidelines.  The new scenario, involving chlorine, is presented in this revised RMP.\n\nThe FMC APG Baltimore Plant manufacturing facility is committed to protecting the safety and health of employees, contractors, customers, the surrounding community and the environment.  Furthermore, it is committed to conducting business in a manner that is compatible with the balanced environmental needs of the community in which it operates. This commitment requires compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, facilities that are designed and operated to high standards, and systematic identification and management of safety, health, and environmental risks. \n\nIn keeping with this commitment, the FMC APG Baltimore Plant has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify and eliminate potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, process incidents, and breaches of se"

No job is so important that we cannot take time to perform our work safely.\" \n \nThe Safety Management System also includes the following Process Safety Vision statement:\n\n\"The employees at FMC Baltimore are dedicated to developing, implementing and operating sound process safety programs, maintaining compliance with both internal FMC and external requirements, improving process safety program performance using a risk-benefit approach, and addressing process safety and risk management issues and concerns in a timely manner.\n\nFMC Baltimore is fully committed to the Responsible Care initiatives: Process Safety, Employee Safety and Health, Distribution, Pollution Prevention, Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER), and Product Stewardship.\n\nFMC Baltimore achieves compliance with Responsible Care codes through workplace health and safety programs as well as release and waste generation reduction programs.  These programs ensure that FMC Baltimore is operated in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of personnel and the public.\"\n\nThe management of the FMC APG Baltimore Plant has authorized specific risk management-related programs and activities in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program ruling (40 CFR Part 68).

Additional programs are in effect to prevent the accidental release of these hazardous substances and to effectively respond to an emergency if a release does occur.\n\n\nThe FMC Corporation, Agricultural Products Group Baltimore Plant \n\nThe Baltimore Plant produces herbicides and pesticides for use in products providing crop protection and pest control.  The plant's end products are shipped offsite for formulation and distribution to external users.  The processes covered by the EPA's Risk Management Program requirements at this facility include the Sulfentrazone Process, MAC (methallyl chloride) Process, and the Clomazone Process.\n\nThe Sulfentrazone Process includes the regulated chemicals chlorine (CAS Number 007782-50-5), nitric acid (CAS Number 007697-37-2), oleum (CAS Number 008014-95-7), and acetaldehyde (CAS Number 000075-07-0).  The MAC Process includes the regulated chemicals chlorine (CAS Number 007782-50-5) and isobutylene (CAS Number 000115-11-7).  The Clomazone Process includes the regulated chemical anhydrous hydrogen chloride (CAS Number 007647-01-0). \n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of chemicals, FMC Baltimore has implemented several precautionary measures.  These measures include process and equipment controls, operating procedures, preventive maintenance programs, safe work practices, employee training, and audit programs.  In addition, all process equipment and systems are designed and constructed in accordance with recognized chemical industry codes and standards.\n\nThe Baltimore Plant has developed and implemented a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program covering the storage, use and handling of the plant's chemicals.  As part of this program, the plant's processes are periodically evaluated to analyze all of the potential hazards associated with each process, including the potential to release chemicals. "

These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases.  Additional Safe Work Procedures have also been developed to address the hazards associated with specific work activities performed in the plant.  Safety committees, consisting of personnel from all plant disciplines, periodically evaluate the procedures and perform behavior-based safety observations to monitor implementation.\n\nFMC Baltimore understands that maintaining the plant's process equipment in good working order is essential for the prevention of accidental releases and has accordingly developed and implemented a preventive maintenance program.  This program is scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that process equipment, and their associated systems, are maintained in a safe operating condition.  Routine inspections are performed and equipment checklists are used to provide advanced notice of potential maintenance and repair needs.\n\nTo ensure that the control measures at the Baltimore Plant are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled compliance audits are performed.  In accordance with the PSM program and FMC's corporate requirements, comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program audits are conducted by an outside team of experts every three years.  In addition, the facilities and records of the Baltimore Plant are periodically inspected and audited by the following agencies and organizations:\n\nThe Maryland State Occupational Safety and Health Program (MOSH)\nThe Maryland State Department of the Environment (MDE)\nThe Baltimore City Fire Department (BCFD)\nThe United States Coast Guard (USCG)\nFactory Mutual\n\nIn addition, loss prevention and risk management audits are conducted by outside organizations for plant insurance purposes.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident His"

However, there were two minor releases of chlorine and one minor release of nitric acid during this time.  Each of these releases resulted in on-plant first aid attention only.  There were no impacts to the environment or the surrounding community since all of the releases remained within the plant boundaries.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe FMC Baltimore Plant has a multi-faceted Emergency Management Program for response to the various types and magnitudes of emergencies that could potentially occur at the facility.  The program addresses all aspects of emergency response and consists of several elements including:\n\n1) A written Emergency Response Plan developed specifically for the hazards and potential emergencies that may occur at the plant.\n\n2) Coordination of the plan with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\n\n3) An onsite Emergency Response Brigade trained and equipped to respond to chemical releases, fires, and medical emergencies.\n\n4) An onsite Incident Command System to direct the Emergency Response Brigade and act as the liaison with outside response agencies.\n\n5) Training and drills conducted jointly with local and state agencies including the Baltimore City Fire Department (LEPC).\n\n6) Coordination of the Emergency Management Program with the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Program (SBIMAP), an area-wide organization sharing response equipment, supplies and expertise among its members, including assistance to Fire Departments dealing with non-member emergencies.\n\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nAs part of the Baltimore Plant's efforts to continuously improve the operations of the facility, several changes are planned to improve safety and further reduce the potential for a release of hazardous chemicals.  Some of these changes are currently underway and sev"
