(Smithfield)  located at Madison, Florida.  Smithfield requires each of their plants to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Smithfield's corporate environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nSmithfield Madison is located at 294 SW Harvey Greene Drive in the southeast corner of the city of Madison, Madison County, Florida.  The facility consists of areas for manufacturing and packaging of luncheon meats, hot dogs, and smoked meats.  The facility also includes areas for freezer and cooler storage of these perishable items for distribution to Smithfield's customers.\n\nSmithfield Madison has one ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The ammonia refrigeration system's equipment is located in two compressor rooms in the southwest and northeast corners of the building.  All of the equipment for the southwest system is located inside the building.  The high pressure receivers (HPRs) are the largest capacity vessels in the ammonia refrigeration system capable of holding approximately 5,600 lbs. of ammonia each.  The HPR chosen for the worst case is located outside.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.   For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Smithfield Madison refrigeration process in the P"

Smithfield will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program for ammonia.  \n\nSmithfield Madison has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Smithfield also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, are reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include compilation of all equipment information and the development of  Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).   Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, Process Hazard Analysis, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4.

The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has trained some employees as first responders in accordance with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Madison County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the District 3 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (850) 413-9911.\n\n6.   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
