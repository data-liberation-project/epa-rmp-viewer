Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Action Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and mixing of anhydrous ammonia, which is used in the manufacturing of 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer (ammonium phosphate). The ammonium phosphate is used for blending into other liquid fertilizer mixtures and for wholesale distribution to member cooperatives.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 110,000 pounds stored in one (1) 25,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  This facility is loaded by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.    \n\nUp to 100 times per year 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank"

The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank. The manufacturing process is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and Program 3 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 25,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 110,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.06 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the storage tank is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the storage tank to the 10-34-0 reactor.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.56 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes"

The following sections briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process.\n\n1) Process Safety Information:  The process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures for operating the process equipment are periodically reviewed by management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the process equipment are maintained and updated. \n\n2) Process Hazard Analysis:  Management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the process.  The process hazard analysis reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the process hazard analysis reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n3) Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures for the process are readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  The operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary so that they reflect current practices and changes to the process or equipment. \n\n4) Training:  All operators of the process equipment participate in a training program.  Initial training consists of classroom type instruction that covers health and safety hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n5) Mechanical Integrity:  A written mechanical integrity program is used to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.

Documentation of each inspection and test on process equipment is maintained in the appropriate format.  Deficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken for safe operation.  Appropriate checks and inspections are performed so that equipment is installed properly and consistent with design specifications and manufacture's instructions.\n                                                                                     \n6) Management of Change:  Written procedures are used to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.

The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \n\n9) Incident Investigation:  Management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\n10) Employee Participation: A written plan of action regarding employee participation is readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.

Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
