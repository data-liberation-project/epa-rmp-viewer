This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n                  1) To save lives;\r\n                  2) To minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n                  3) To protect the environment; and\r\n                  4) To minimize property damage.\r\nAllens maintains an emergency response plan for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazard information, and accident mitigation procedures.  The procedures will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations which may arise at the facility, including any accidental releases of ammonia.  The facility staff recently met with LEPC personnel to conduct a table-top exercise.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Allens facility chills and stores a variety of food products in the cold and frozen storage warehouse.  The facility is chilled by a refrigeration process that uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process, consisting of compressors, evaporators, condensers, vessels, piping, valves, and instrumentation, cycles the ammonia through various physical states, from  high pressure liquid, to low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid.  These changes in the system pressure enable ammonia to absorb ambient heat and provide cooling to the food storage areas.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\"Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high pressure side.  The refrigeration process holds approximately 29,500 pounds of ammonia.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThis facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (II"
