Anderson St.\nGreensburg, In   47240\n\nFor Further Information Contact:       Roger DuMond,  Corporate Compliance Manager\n\nre:  Risk Management Plan for Anhydrous Ammonia-\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n   The owners, management, and employees of Kova Fertilizer @ Greensburg are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale \n   to area farmers.\n - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area farmers as a \n   vital crop production nutrient (nitrogen).\n - The maximum amount stored at this facility would be 130,000 pounds (25,500 gallons) in \n   our tanks of 30,000 gallons filled to capacity (85% maximum).  Product is routinely \n   loaded into 1000 gallon mobile tanks for pick-up by and sale to area farmers.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n   a. The worst case scenario for this facility would be the release of the total contents \n      of the 30,000 gallon storage tank as a gas over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum \n      quantity released would be 125,00 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest \n      storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards, industry \n      recommendations, and company policy.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to \n      200 ppm) has been calculated for this urban community as 1.06 miles.\n   b. The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history \n      and/or most likely to happen release information.  For this facility, we have made \n      our calculation based on hose rupture du"
