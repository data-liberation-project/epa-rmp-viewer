Non the less, as part of an offsite consequence analysis, one worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario were examined.  The worst case scenario (CLW-2) for this facility deals with the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a one ton cylinder over a 10-minute period.  This scenario would only happen in the event of a catastrophic failure, or rupture, of a cylinder due to corrosion, impact or construction defects.  This pumping facility is located at elevation 830, in an area which is both rural and urban.  It also lies within 0.6 miles of the St. Louis River / Lake Superior Basin which is at elevation 600.  The topography immediately north and west of the facility is heavily forested and rises abruptly, 320 feet in elevation, at an approximate 17 percent grade.  This would most likely direct any chlorine vapor cloud to mitigate downhill to the east and south.  The distance to the radial endpoint is 3.03 miles and could include an estimated population of 19,200 individuals.  \n\nA more likely alternate release scenario (CLA-3) would involve the release of 317 pounds of chlorine over a 60-minute"

The distance to the radial endpoint would be 0.57 miles and could include an estimated population of 450 individuals.  \n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn order to minimize the risk of injury to employees and the public as the result of an accidental release, a comprehensive management program has been developed to address the safe handling, storage and use of chlorine.  This program involves every department employee in the assignment of responsibilities, employee training, proper operation, maintenance and safety procedures, routine inspections, record keeping, and periodic program evaluations.       \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for Cloquet's Pump Station No. 2 has been developed and coordinated directly with the City of Duluth's Fire Department.  The written ERP directs employees in the best methods to prevent an incident and how to respond if one occurs.  Although Cloquet personnel are respirator trained and certified, in the case of a major incident, the City of Duluth Fire Department becomes the commander and assumes the role of directing response activities, including any community emergency evacuation measures.  \n\nThe Duluth Fire Department is HazMat trained and knowledgeable in dealing with any release from this facility.  As part of the Prevention Program and Emergency Response Plan, Pump Station No. 2 is toured and inspected annually by the Duluth Fire Department.  The Fire Department has the power to cite the facility and enforce abatement of safety hazards, if deemed necessary.  \n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe purpose of every Risk Management Plan it to reduce the risk of injury, or even death, to employees and to the public, from an accidental release of hazardous chemicals.

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nDuring the mid 1960's, the City of Cloquet constructed a pipeline to pump water from Lake Superior to Cloquet.  The primary purpose of this water transmission facility is to furnish industrial process water to the Potlatch Papermill located in Cloquet.  In addition, this facility also furnishes raw water to Superior Water, Light and Power, in Superior, Wisconsin as part of this community's domestic water supply.  The Cloquet Lake Superior Waterline also serves as a backup supply to Cloquet's municipal well system. \n\nAn important part of Cloquet's Lake Superior Water system, is its Pump Station No. 2 which is located in West Duluth, Minnesota.  This facility acts as a relay pump station, which boosts water up and over the hillside in West Duluth, to Cloquet at an average rate of 12 to 15 million gallons per day.  At this facility, chlorine gas is added to the Lake water for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations 40 CFR Part 68, require facilities that have a regulated substance, above the listed threshold quantities, to develop a formal Risk Management Program to prevent and minimize the impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.  \n\nThe City of Cloquet's Water Pumping Station No. 2, located in West Duluth, exceeds the EPA's threshold limit of 2,500 pounds for Chlorine.  The maximum intended inventory for this facility is 10,000 pounds.  Consequently, the Cloquet Water Department has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in accordance with RMP Program 3 requirements.   \n                                                                                                                                                                   RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nThe Risk Management Plan for this facility was developed with the assistance of the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program For Water Treatment Plants as compiled and published by the American"
