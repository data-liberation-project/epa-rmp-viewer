This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training, design safety, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nThe Bridger Lake Production Facility is located in Summit County, UT and is situated along the west side of the Henry's Fork River, approximately 20 miles south of Mountain View, Wyoming.  The facility is located within the Bridger National Forest which is managed by the United States Forest Service (USFS).  The production facility receives natural gas from well production.  The natural gas is compressed and either sold to market or returned to the well for re-injection via a pipeline.  Slug liquids are extracted and partially stabilized in a column to make a y-grade product which is composed of: ethane, propane, isobutene, butane, pentane, isopentane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and nonane. These are the primary components of the chemical inventory listed in the RMP rule and comprise 168,901 pounds.  The liquids are stored on site in two 18,000 gallon storage tanks and delivered and sold via truck.  \n\nProgram Level 1\nIt has been determined that the Bridger Lake Production Facility is a Program 1 facility.  Although the facility is within a National Park and/or recreational area, these areas are used only occasionally for camping, hiking, and hunting and per the guidance documents do not qualify the area as a public receptor.  This facility does not qualify as an OSHA Process Safety "

      "SummaryText": "Management facility under 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nRelease Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario assumes that the entire volume from both containers is released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case analysis was based on the predominant regulated flammable component of the mixture which in this case is n-Butane.  RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.4 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 168,901 pounds for the process.\n\nAccident History\nThis facility has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWhiting takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facilities by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  The facility is a Program Level 1 facility and therefore does not have a specific emergency response program.  Whiting does although have a company-wide Emergency Response Plan, which includes emergency contact information for the area, that is implemented when needed and is designed to protect personnel, property, and the environment in event of an emergency as well as to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel.   \n\nConclusion\nWhiting understands that strong health, safety, and environmental principles, properly integrated into our management processes, and day to day practices, greatly contributes to our business success.  \n"
