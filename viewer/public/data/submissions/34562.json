      "SummaryText": "We at Oxarc, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \"A\" and \"B\" kits are available for containment in case of gas leaks.\n\nOur facility's primary activity is cylinder gas distribution and a retail welding supply store.  We have two regulated substances, chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, at our faciltiy.  The maximum amounts stored are 33,000 pounds of chlorine and 14,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which are stored in 150 pound cylinders, ton containers, and short-filled ton containers.\n\nSince neither of the products is used at our facility and valves are never opened, our accidental release prevention program centers around the proper and safe handling of cylinders or containers.  Proper equipment is provided and training such as forklift operation is documented.\n\nThere has been no accidental release during the previous five years.\n\nOxarc has a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes provisions for notification of neighbors and emergency response agencies, evacuation, first and and medical treatment.  The plan is  updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place.\n\nNo changes are currently planned.  We continue to look for ways to reduce the quantity of chemicals on hand."
