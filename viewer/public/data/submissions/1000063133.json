These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \r\n\r\n\tOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\tTecumseh Poultry is a poultry processing plant in Waverly, Nebraska which is a food processing plant.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling capabilities.  The system is operated as a single stage system.  The heat loads in the plant originate from coolers, process coolers, and dock cooling.  Pumped liquid flows from the recirculator vesse"

The recirculated ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the recirculator via a common suction header.  High side ammonia gas from the recirculator is then fed to the high stage compressors.  During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia gas will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high stage compressors to an evaporative condenser where heat is removed, turning the gas into a high pressure liquid.  The high-pressure liquid is collected in the high-pressure receivers.  The liquid collected in the high-pressure receivers provides liquid make-up for the recirculator.\r\n\r\nThe emergency action plan at Tecumseh Poultry requires all associates to be trained in safe evacuation and notification procedures in cases of actual or drill emergencies. Training shall include escape routes, notification of appropriate response agencies, instructions on activating a building fire alarm system and what should be done after evacuating a building. To aid in the training process evacuation drills are conducted at the facility.  In the case of an emergency, the Safety Manager and Maintenance Manager have overall responsibility for the implementation of the emergency response plan. The alternate emergency coordinator is the Vice President of Operation is and second shift is the Distribution Manager.  Arrangements have been made to coordinate the Tecumseh Poultry's Emergency Action Plan and applicable emergency services with the following local agencies:\r\n\r\nLancaster County LEPC \r\n(402)-441-7441\r\nJames Davidsaver\r\n\r\nLancaster County Sheriff Department\r\n(402)-786-6500\r\n\r\nWaverly Fire Department\r\n(402)-786-3055\r\n\r\nUpon discovering an emergency situation, all employees shall immediately notify their lead person, supervisor, the Human Resource"

The lead person or supervisor of the affected area, Human Resources, or maintenance personnel are to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action and should activate the evacuation alarm if necessary.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, first determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area.   An announcement will be made over the PA system informing employees that they are to evacuate the building and where to assemble.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.  In the event of an evacuation, all employees should proceed to the designated assembly area and await further instructions from their evacuation supervisor. Facility map identifying exit doors, evacuation routes and assembly areas are posted at various locations throughout the facility.  All emergency exit doors are clearly marked and are tested monthly for ease of operation and checked that they are free of obstructions.  Once everyone has evacuated the facility and arrived at their designated meeting area, a head count must be conducted by the evacuation supervisor to account for missing people, including visitors and/or contractors in his/her area.  A daily crew/employee list shall be maintained for each department within the facility. Ten minutes will be allowed for critical unit operators to shutdown their equipment and reach the designated meeting location before attendance will be reported.  \r\nIn the event of an emergency release of ammonia it will be necessary for some specifically assigned and properly trained employees to remain in work areas that are being evacuated long enough to perform critical operations.
