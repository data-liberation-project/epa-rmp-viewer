Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Faciltiy located on Mitchell Avenue, in St. Joseph, Missouri complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA's Process Saety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)rules (29 CFR 1910.120).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addreses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage handling and processing of a highly hazardous chemical, ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR 1010, we promote overall palnt, worker, and community safety.  Our Rish Management Program enables our facility ot prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leeaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of acidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site propluplations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the letter of EPS's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  Sara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Facility's Risk Management System has clearly defined lines of authority and designationo f responsibilities to ensure that the risk management plans are developed, implemented, and revised.  Sara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Facility's safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practicies which govenrn individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nSara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Facility is a meat processing facility, located at 5807 Mitchell A"

Preparation of the meat products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh.  The system consists of high pressure tanks, compressors, piping, pumps, chillers, and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  the ammonia may exist as a gas or as a liequid in different parts of the system.  The total amount of ammonia present in the refrigeration system can contain quantities over the 10,000 pound threshold.  this process is a Program 3 process as defined by the Risk Management Program rul (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n3.  Wors-Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nAmmonia\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Sara Lee Foods, St. Joseph Facility evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst case and alternate case scenario were developed.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Sara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Facility complies with EPS's Chemcial Accident Prevention Provision rules and OSHA safety rules under 29 CFR 1910 for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and mplemented for ammonia at the Sara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Facility.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in Accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2- 1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installatin of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia using a \"What-If checklist\" and all identified problems were  addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia stora"

All persons weorking with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operatin procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia refrigeration equipment and operations.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nSince this facility was built in 1999, no accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in offsite impacts of any kind.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program at the Sara Lee Foods-St. Joseph Facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Buchanan County (Missouri) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) , and the St. Jospeh, Missouri Fire Department.  The Sara Lee Foods-St. Jospeh Facility emergency resonse team trains and drills monthly.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of fir department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is a mature industry employing known technology.  Yet, the plant remains abreast of current innovations that will improve safety.  To this end, the Sara Lee Foods-St. Jospeh Facility is an active member of the International Istitute of ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Training Association (RETA).  This involvement enables the facility to learn and implement the most modern safety system improvements as they emerge within the ammonia refrigeration industry.  As part of our ongoing program to upgrade the safety of our refrigeration system, the facility ahs installed improved rupture disks on our pre"
