In our Culpeper\r\nfacility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by United States Environmental\r\nProtection Agency. Chlorine is needed in our milling process, it is necessary to observe safety\r\nprecautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our\r\npersonal health as well as our coworkers.\r\nWe have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as\r\ndesign, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\r\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement controls to prevent the possible release of\r\nregulated substances. Our emergency response procedure includes notification of the local fire\r\nauthority and of any potentially effected neighbors. Access to the site is restricted to authorized\r\nplant employees, management personnel and contractors. Our chlorine system is enclosed within\r\nthe plant building. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.\r\nSafety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices\r\ninherent in the design of this facility, and combined with the safe handling procedures that we use,\r\nand the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nOur facilities primary activities are flour milling, grinding wheat into flour.\r\nThe only regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. Chlorine is used to whiten the flour\r\nand provide specified baking and cooking properties required by our clients for their breads, batter,\r\nmixes and similar flour products.\r\nChlorine is received by truck in 2,000 pound cylinders. A total of four cylinders are stored in a\r\nrecently constructed, purpose built, building. Our maximum capacity"

The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. One process at our facility is subject to the\r\nOSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and with applicable state codes and\r\nregulations including OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard. This facility was designed and\r\nconstructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our\r\nemployees as well as our neighbors and environment. The delivery drivers have been thoroughly\r\ntrained in regard to chlorine hazards and emergency response. Our employees watch the delivery\r\nof each truck bringing chlorine to our site. In addition, we contract out to chlorine system\r\nprofessionals to periodically inspect our chlorine system, and make any necessary adjustments to\r\neither equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of chlorine.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year accident history:\r\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases, injuries, or environmental damage resulting from\r\nour chlorine system in at least the past 10 years. This is a newly constructed system. \r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program:\r\nThe site has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases hazardous\r\nmaterials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid,\r\nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and\r\nserviced. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any changes taking place within our processes that\r\nwould require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nThe latest hazard review of the chlorine system was conducted"
