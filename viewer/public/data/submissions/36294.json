Purpose\n\nThis document describes the Equistar Chemicals Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex's philosophy and procedures for managing risk to employee health, public safety and to the environment.  It is intended to be just a summary of the many policies, procedures and actions that are taken to prevent or mitigate the potential release of chemicals listed under EPA 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP) Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7).\n\n2. Plant Overview\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex is an Olefins and Aromatics production facility.  It manufactures a variety of petrochemical products, which are used by others to manufacture a wide range of products from plastics to gasoline additives.  The complex consists of two production units, the Olefins Unit and the Hydrocarbons Unit and a Distribution Tank Farm Area.  The two units and the tank farm are fully integrated and interconnected in the production of Olefins and Aromatics and are treated, for the purposes of RMP, as a single process.  The process all starts in what is called the Olefins Unit, where plant feedstock is cracked in a furnace.  The feedstock is a mixture of naturally occurring hydrocarbons that range from natural gasoline, through gas well condensates, to heavy diesels.    In cracking, the hydrocarbon chains are broken into shorter chains and in some cases recombined into even longer chains of hydrocarbons.  The result is a mixture of many hydrocarbons, which must be separated (and in some cases reacted with hydrogen) in order to become usable products.  The Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex manufactures the following products; Ethylene, Propylene, Ethane, Pyrolysis Gasoline, Heavy Aromatic Oil (HAO), Light Pyrolysis Oil, Pyrolysis Tar, Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), Raffinate I, Raffinate II, Resin Oil, Benzene,"

      "SummaryText": "Butadiene, Mixed C4 Hydrocarbons, Toluene, and UDEX Raffinate, Methyl-Tert-Butyl-Ether (MTBE), and Isoprene.  In addition to these products, the following are used as feedstocks to the plant in making the products; Olefins Unit Feedstock as described above, Ethane, Butane, Drip Oils and Methanol.  The feedstocks are all transported to the facility by pipeline or barge and the products are transported from the facility by barge, pipeline or tank truck.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent and mitigate possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel (RTFC) are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Chocolate Bayou Mutual Aid Group which provides additional emergency response resources.\n\n4. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex encompasses Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing.  In the process of manufacturing these chemicals, some of which are regulated substances, we handle several flammable mixtures, comprising of eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances, and we utilize one (1) toxic regulated substance.  The eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances are: 1-3 Butadiene, Butane, Butene, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Isoprene, Methane, Methyl Butene, 1-3 Pentadiene, Pentane, Pentene, Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, and Vinyl Acetylene.  The one (1) toxic regulated substance is Chlorine used as a cooling water treatment chemical.\n\n5. The Worse-Case Release Sce"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.

      "SummaryText": "Purpose\r\n\r\nThis document describes the Equistar Chemicals Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex's philosophy and procedures for managing risk to employee health, public safety and to the environment.  It is intended to be just a summary of the many policies, procedures and actions that are taken to prevent or mitigate the potential release of chemicals listed under EPA 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP) Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7).\r\n\r\n2. Plant Overview\r\n\r\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex is an Olefins and Aromatics production facility.  It manufactures a variety of petrochemical products, which are used by others to manufacture a wide range of products from plastics to gasoline additives.  The complex consists of two production units, the Olefins Unit and the Hydrocarbons Unit and a Distribution Tank Farm Area.  The two units and the tank farm are fully integrated and interconnected in the production of Olefins and Aromatics and are treated, for the purposes of RMP, as a single process.  The process all starts in what is called the Olefins Unit, where plant feedstock is cracked in a furnace.  The feedstock is a mixture of naturally occurring hydrocarbons that range from natural gasoline, through gas well condensates, to heavy diesels.    In cracking, the hydrocarbon chains are broken into shorter chains and in some cases recombined into even longer chains of hydrocarbons.  The result is a mixture of many hydrocarbons, which must be separated (and in some cases reacted with hydrogen) in order to become usable products.  The Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex manufactures the following products; Ethylene, Propylene, Ethane, Pyrolysis Gasoline, Heavy Aromatic Oil (HAO), Light Pyrolysis Oil, Pyrolysis Tar, Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), Raffinate I, Raffinate II, Resin Oil, Benzene, Butadiene, Mixed C4 Hydrocarbons, Toluene, and UDEX Raffinate, Methyl-Tert-Butyl-Ether (MTBE), and Isoprene.

      "SummaryText": "n addition to these products, the following are used as feedstocks to the plant in making the products; Olefins Unit Feedstock as described above, Ethane, Butane, Drip Oils and Methanol.  The feedstocks are all transported to the facility by pipeline or barge and the products are transported from the facility by barge, pipeline or tank truck.\r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent and mitigate possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel (RTFC) are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Chocolate Bayou Mutual Aid Group which provides additional emergency response resources.\r\n\r\n4. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex encompasses Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing.  In the process of manufacturing these chemicals, some of which are regulated substances, we handle several flammable mixtures, comprising of eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances, and we utilize one (1) toxic regulated substance.  The eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances are: 1-3 Butadiene, Butane, Butene, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Isoprene, Methane, Methyl Butene, 1-3 Pentadiene, Pentane, Pentene, Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, and Vinyl Acetylene.  The one (1) toxic regulated substance is Chlorine used as a cooling water treatment chemical.\r\n\r\n5.
