      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\nChocolate Bayou Chemical Complex\n\n1. Purpose\n\nThis document describes the Equistar Chemicals Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex's philosophy and procedures for managing risk to employee health, public safety and to the environment.  It is intended to be just a summary of the many policies, procedures and actions that are taken to prevent or mitigate the potential release of chemicals listed under EPA 40 CFR 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP) Under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7).\n\n2. Plant Overview\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex is an Olefins and Aromatics production facility.  It manufactures a variety of petrochemical products, which are used by others to manufacture a wide range of products from plastics to gasoline additives.  The complex consists of two production units, the Olefins Unit and the Hydrocarbons Unit and a Distribution Tank Farm Area.  The two units and the tank farm are fully integrated and interconnected in the production of Olefins and Aromatics and are treated, for the purposes of RMP, as a single process.  The process all starts in what is called the Olefins Unit, where plant feedstock is \"cracked\" in a furnace.  The feedstock is a mixture of naturally occurring hydrocarbons that range from natural gasoline, through gas well condensates, to heavy diesels.    In \"cracking\", the hydrocarbon chains are broken into shorter chains and in some cases recombined into even longer chains of hydrocarbons.  The result is a mixture of many hydrocarbons, which must be separated (and in some cases reacted with hydrogen) in order to become usable products.  The Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex manufactures the following products; Ethylene, Propylene, Ethane, Pyrolysis Gasoline, Heavy Aromatic Oil (HAO), Light Pyrolysis Oil, Pyrolysis Tar, Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), Raffinate I, Raffinate II, Resin Oil, Benzene, "

In addition to these products, the following are used as feedstocks to the plant in making the products; Olefins Unit Feedstock as described above, Ethane, Butane, Drip Oils and Methanol.  The feedstocks are all transported to the facility by pipeline or barge and the products are transported from the facility by barge, pipeline or tank truck.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEquistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent and mitigate possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel (RTFC) are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Chocolate Bayou Mutual Aid Group which provides additional emergency response resources.\n\n4. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex encompasses Olefins and Aromatics manufacturing.  In the process of manufacturing these chemicals, some of which are regulated substances, we handle several flammable mixtures, comprising of eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances, and we utilize one (1) toxic regulated substance.  The eighteen (18) regulated flammable substances are: 1-3 Butadiene, Butane, Butene, Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Isopentane, Isoprene, Methane, Methyl Butene, 1-3 Pentadiene, Pentane, Pentene, Propadiene, Propane, Propylene, and Vinyl Acetylene.  The one (1) toxic regulated substance is Chlorine used as a cooling water treatment chemical.\n\n5. The Worse-Case Release Sce"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEquistar has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed, constructed, and is maintained in accordance with many national Codes and Standards too numerous to mention in this short summary.  Codes or Standards from the following major organizations are used: ASME, ANSI, API, IEEE, NFPA, ASTM and ISA.  All of the processes at the Equistar Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAlso, Equistar at the Chocolate Bayou Chemical Complex has taken the additional leadership step of becoming a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal industry safety requirements by committing to the philosophy of continuous improvement in safety performance.  This dedication on the part of the management and the employees of the site, ensures that we will continue to push for reductions in incidents and improvements in reducing the potential hazards associated with our processes.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at Equistar.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEquistar maintains a record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\nEquistar conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

Any findings related to the PHR are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperations Procedures\nFor the purposes of operating our facilities safely, Equistar maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operating technicians involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nEquistar has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision along with additional training until they are qualified to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEquistar carries out documented maintenance inspections and testing of process equipment and controls to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these inspections and checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief valves and flare systems, pumps, compressors and fire water deluge/monitor systems.  Some instruments that are inspected and checked include; emergency shutdown systems, interlocks and alarms, process controls, and vapor detection systems.

The plant also has an online computer release modeling system called \"Safer\" which uses current meteorological data and chemical release information to predict the direction, distance and concentration of the release plume.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response plans are periodically drilled and practiced.  Our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  And of course, the plan is reviewed and updated as needed to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n9. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of various elements of our accidental release prevention program.   The following are just some of the items that were identified during unit PHAs and are being planned for installation:\n? Additional vapor detection points in the Olefins Unit\n? Revisions to operating procedures to help alert operating personnel to help prevent a potential auto-refrigeration excursion\n? Additional relief protection\n? Installation of additional alarms and interlocks\n? Installation of additional control systems\n? Develop procedures to provide effective long-term isolation of equipment safely\n\nCompletion of these action items should reduce the probability of, the potential for and/or the consequence of, a release of RMP regulated chemicals.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRisk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\nEquistar Chemicals, LP\n\nChocolate Bayou Chemical Complex\n\n\n\n1.
