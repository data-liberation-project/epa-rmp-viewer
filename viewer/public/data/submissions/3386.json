The maximum storage quantity of Anhydrous is 84,118 lbs..  The facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - A maximum of 84,118 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia could be released in a gaseous state over a duration of 10 minutes at 8,412 lbs/min into the area surrounding the plant up to 0.83 miles to endpoint.  The offsite consequences would include approximately 9  residential individuals.\n\nAlternatvie Release Scenario - A transfer hose failure on the Anhydrous Ammonia has the potential to release 26,638 lbs. of product in a gaseous state over 2 minutes at a rate of 13,319 lbs/min in the area surrounding the plant up to .59 miles.  The offsite consequences would include approximately 6 residential occupants.\n\nThe owners, management and employees at the facility are prepared to work with local fire departments and other authorities to minimize the impact of any release to the communtiy and the enviornment.  The facility has had no such releases.  Complying with safety standards for the sstorage and handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia and completing regular maintenance on the equipment at the facility will continue to prevent any accidental releases at the Superior Deshler, Inc. plant near Reynolds Nebraska."
