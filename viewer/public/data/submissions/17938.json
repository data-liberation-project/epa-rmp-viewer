      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nProdica's Kennewick Plant is comprised of the three neighboring areas, Kennewick, Hedges, and Finley Facilities.  The Kennewick Plant along with the West Sacramento, Rivergate, and Fresno Facilities constitute the integrated operation known as Prodica Manufacturing.  The Prodica Kennewick Plant - Kennewick Facility handles anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia which are considered hazardous materials and are regulated substances under the Federal Accidental Release Program (ARP) and are considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of these chemicals make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling them to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of Washington rules and regulations.  The prevention of accidental releases depends on adherence to the procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel. The various programs and documentation can be found in the facility's comprehensive loss control system. \n\n2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFor the Kennewick Plant, Kennewick Facility anhydrous ammonia, limestone and prilled or granulated urea are the raw materials used to manufacture nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, GAN, UAN-32, AN-20 and CAN-17 at the Kennewick Facility. The anhydrous ammonia feedstock for the Kennewick Facility processes is supplied from production at the Finley Facility, by marine vesel and by rail.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received into the Kennewick Facility from the pipeline from the Hedges Facility, the pipeline from the Finley Facility, by rail-car, and by river barge from the Rivergate Facility.  At the Kennewick Facility, anhydrous ammonia is sto"

Sphere V-441 is a pressure vessel 65 feet in diameter that is designed to store liquid ammonia.  Sphere pressure is controlled by the compressor system, which draws ammonia vapors from the Sphere's vapor space or by venting ammonia vapor to the Plant 9 ammonia system to make nitric acid.  The high pressure vapor is condensed to liquid ammonia in a heat exchanger, using cooling (river) water and returned to the sphere.  The ammonia bullets are temporary storage cylinders.  The bullets are used as pressure vessels for distribution of liquid ammonia to the various operating units.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for interconnected equipment must consider the maximum contents of each vessel or pipeline which contains a regulated substance above the threshold quantity. Administrative controls may be taken into account for determining the maximum quantity.  In addition, smaller quantities of the regulated substance handled at higher process temperature or pressure must be considered if such a scenario would result in a greater distance to an end-point beyond the stationary source boundary.  The Worst Case scenario did not consider any administrative control to limit the amount of regulated substance in any subject vessel.  The ammonia Sphere V-441,which contains anhydrous ammonia, yields the greatest distance to the end-point and is designated as the Worst Case release scenario.  The distance to the end-point of 200 ppm for the Worst Case scenario, determined by RMP*COMP, is beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for anhydrous ammonia, as submitted, is the most credible release scenario with the greatest distance to toxic endpoint. This is the continuous release of liquid anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia transfer pump  P-441 or P-441A due to complete seal failure.  This result"

The distance to the end-point of 200 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia, determined by RMP*COMP, is beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for aqua ammonia, as submitted, is the most credible release scenario with the greatest distance to toxic endpoint.  This is the continuous release of the 25% liquid aqua ammonia from a tank truck transfer hose due to failure or sudden uncoupling.  This results in the release of gaseous ammonia, from the 77 degrees Fahrenheit aqua ammonia, at the rate of 1,670 lb/min for 2 minutes.  The distance to the end-point of 200 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario for aqua ammonia, determined by RMP*COMP, is beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls are in place to prevent accidental releases. Additional administrative controls, to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to minimize the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released if a release were to occur.  These administrative controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the equipment, processes and systems that use anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia, as well as the training provided to the operators of these processes and systems.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures for each reported scenario exist that restrict the amount of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the processes, systems and related equipment and components that use anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.\n\n4.

The implementation of PSM, safety related Administrative Procedures and Safe Work Practices represent the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents to be reported in this RMP in the previous five-year history of the facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe details of the Emergency Response Program for the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the plant are contained within two documents.  One is the Emergency Preparedness Action Plan which contains all of the emergency response program elements.  It is intended to be a compliance, reference and training guide.  The other is the On Scene Incident Management Guide which is a field guide for response actions based on the chemical involved.  It is intended to be used by the response personnel while responding to an emergency event.  The Emergency Response Program incorporates public notification and alert systems. It also contains procedures for alerting personnel at the facility to shelter-in-place or evacuate the facility and proceed to the assembly areas and await the arrival of responders from the Benton County Fire Department, if a release occurs that requires shelter-in-place or evacuation. The plant has an emergency response team on site at all times, trained in accordance with the HAZWOPER regulation, 29 CFR 120. The plant conducts emergency internal drills and joint drills with the Fire Department.\n\n7.
