If an accidental release shold occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment. Th primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored and transfered for use as a crop production nutrient. The maximum  quanity handled would be the 145,000 stored in our storage tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 49,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85  percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.50 miles. The alternative release scenario based on th five-year accident history is a release from an open valve in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .47 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requiments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA , 29CFR  1910.111. In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspect our plants on an annual basis. \n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location. In the past five years we have had no reportable accidents nor to our knowledge have we had any off-sight deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, evacuations or environmental damage.\n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan and emergency response plan which are required by OSHA. We also report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inventories and locations has required by The Community-Right-To-Know rules and regulations. Safety improvement"
