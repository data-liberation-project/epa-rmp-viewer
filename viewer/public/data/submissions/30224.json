The facility has a production capacity of approximately 210-280 tons of ice per day and utilizes approximately 19,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe refrigeration system is a standard design ammonia system consisting of compressors, condensers, storage tanks, ice makers, and freezer vaults. The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, low level cutouts on all recirculator and pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment. Ammonia detectors in the engine room and icemaker room initiate alarms that are audible throughout the facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility\u00bfs program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment.\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include exhaust purge fans, controls, which shut down the compressors, if operating limits are exceeded, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required. An ammonia detection unit is installed to notify employees in the event of an ammonia leak. Administrative controls are in place, which limit the utilization of vessels at approximately 30-50% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-Jacksonville management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for training, operating procedures, documentation, etc. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation and integration of the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Jacksonville facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential"

A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Jacksonville facility has operated for many years with a good accident record, having no more than minor operational releases. No known reportable releases have occurred at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Jacksonville facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying the public and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan.\n\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the NE Florida Regional Planning Council and the Jacksonville Fire Department, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders if needed. The ammonia has been reported, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC."
