KINGSBURG APPLE RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Kingsburg Apple is preparing a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program to comply with California's Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5, Program Level 3 Elements, and Federally Title 40 CFR Part 68) and California OSHA's \"Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \"Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials\" and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program is being prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program will promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program will enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nWe operate a commercial packinghouse of deciduous tree fruit, primarily apples.  We store all of our packed product in cold storage.  Our facility has three ammonia systems with a combined system charge of 32,000 lbs.  Two on the north side are connected together, while the southern system is separate.  Together, the systems provide refrigerating capacity to three cold storage rooms equipped with forced air cooling, ten cold storage rooms for palleted product, and three temperature controlled fumigation rooms.  \n\nThe system operates as follows.  High pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room, where it passes through a compressor.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a water cooled condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquified and returned to our receiver. \n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our facility as a single process.\n\n3.    AMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\n3.1    Worst Case Scenario\nOur worst case scenario is the failure of our high pressure receiver containing 18,000 lbs of ammonia.  This vessel is outdoors, and the release would not be passively mitigated.  The ammonia w"

Using the program RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 1.1 miles (rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  A map showing the area that would be affected is attached.\n\nIn our opinion, it is extremely unlikely that the worst-case scenario will ever take place.  Our receiver meets industry standards for manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety relief valves limit the operating pressure in this vessel; and our operators are trained in the safe operation of our system. \n\n3.2    Alternative Case Scenario\nOur alternative release scenario is as follows.  We assumed that internal corrosion of an evaporator coil would cause a pipe rupture.  Drawing upon experience, and using the modeling program ALOHA, we estimated that a severe leak could release ammonia at a rate of 50 lbs/min into a confined cold storage room.  We assumed the leak would continue for 10 minutes until the leak was noticed and the flow of ammonia to the coil was stopped. Under this scenario 500 lbs of ammonia would be released over a time period of 10 minutes.  The release would be passively mitigated by being indoors.  Using RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel less than 0.1 miles (rural conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. A map showing the area that would be affected is attached.\n\nAn alternate case scenario that is used by other facilities is to assume that a Safety Relief Valve lifts, releasing ammonia vapor.  However, our pressure safety relief valves are piped to a water sorption tank.  The lifting of a SRV would not result in the release of airborne ammonia.\n4.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Kingsburg Apple is an integral part of the overall business. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a"

Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system/process is constantly being monitored by our refrigeration operator.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment.   Half of our system is controlled by a computer which monitors many process variables, and allows remote control.  In the event of a system upset the computer actuates a dialing program that alerts key personnel and responders.  We will most likely have the other half of our refrigeration system updated to have the same computer monitoring devices by April 21, 2000.  We also have ammonia detectors, which trigger alerts.\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia through monthly safety meetings.  During these meetings we also discuss the preventative measures to take, such as evacuation, in order to not be affected by a release.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 \"Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\"  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves which are piped to a water diffusion tank.  These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to overpressurization.  All ammonia released through the safety relief valves is trapped in the water, and is not emitted into the air.\n5.

Employees will receive Defensive Training (First Responder, Operations Level) specific for ammonia response and meeting HAZWOPER criteria later this year.  Under this plan our employees will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. Initial training to the defensive level (First Responder, Operations Level) as defined in the HAZWOPER regulations will take place before the end of the year.  The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment.  Steps might include stopping the flow of ammonia to a leak point, or using the compressor to suck ammonia away from a leak point. Further response requiring the donning of personal protective equipment would be performed by an outside agency.  All response activities would be coordinated with the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAs of June 21, 1999, the time that this Executive Summary is being submitted, our Risk & Process Safety Management Plan is not complete.  The reason is that in order to do it right a lot of work must be done.  We simply do not have enough qualified employees or resources to meet the initial deadline. Our company operates seasonally and we have found that our ability to allocate managerial and operator resources to prepare this plan depends upon our workload.  In addition, we have found it necessary to obtain help from outside vendors for some critica"
