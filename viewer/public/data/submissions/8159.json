Chemical production has occurred at the site since 1916, originally operating as the Stauffer Chemical Company.\n\nFLEXSYS is the world's leading producer of chemicals for the rubber processing and related industries. FLEXSYS products go into the production of rubber tires and other rubber articles.  In June 1998, FLEXSYS was one of only six companies to receive the 1998 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award. The award, which honors organizations that successfully research, develop and implement outstanding green chemical technologies, was presented at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC. \n\nOur workforce is comprised of production, maintenance, engineering, technical, clerical, and management personnel.  The average level of chemical plant experience for our employees exceeds 15 years.  We are proud of our facility and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe Federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.  FLEXSYS has one chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2), that meets the toxic chemicals TQs, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program for its use within a process.\n\nCS2 is a yellowish liquid with an unpleasant odor. In nature, very small amounts are found in gases from volcanic eruptions and in marshy areas. CS2 has been an important industrial chemical since the 1800s because of its many"

In agriculture, CS2 was formerly widely used as a fumigant to control insects in stored grain. \n\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112(r) (\"112(r)\") requirements with which FLEXSYS must comply for use of CS2 include:\n\n   - Management System development and documentation,\n   - Hazard Assessment for each affected process,\n   - Prevention Program completion,\n   - Emergency Response Program coordination, and\n   - Risk Management Plan submittal.  \n\nIn addition, FLEXSYS recognizes its responsibility under Section 112(r)(1) (the \"general duty clause\") to handle all Extremely Hazardous Substances safely and to identify hazards that may result from accidental releases.  Furthermore, FLEXSYS works to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequences if a release occurs.  Additional chemicals on site, not meeting their TQ or not identified in the 112(r) list rule, include hydrogen sulfide and small quantities of chemicals used in laboratory analysis.  These \"general duty\" chemicals are managed using the sound risk-management principals applied to our chemical fully covered by 112(r).  FLEXSYS follows a prevention program including the use of process safety information, operating procedures, employee training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, incident investigation, compliance audits, \"hot work\" by permit only, and evaluation of contractors.\n\nThis Executive Summary to the FLEXSYS Risk Management Plan (RMP) provides an overview of how we are e"

The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of our\n     program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified engineer has been assigned overall \n     responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program elements.  \n     Responsibility for implementing individual requirements of FLEXSYS' program have been delegated to\n     competent individuals.  An organization chart has been prepared to identify the responsible personnel \n     and lines of authority for implementing the program.  Record-keeping responsibilities are also included in\n     the management system.\n\n     FLEXSYS fully supports the ideals and efforts of its Risk Management Program management system.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n     The Hazard Assessment portion of the 112(r) rule requires facility owners or operators to prepare \n     \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios as appropriate to the operations.  From the release \n     scenarios, facilities are then to determine offsite impacts using specified \"Offsite Consequence \n     Analysis\" parameters for worst-case releases and more realistic parameters for alternative releases.\n\n     As defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):\n        - The worst-case release involves the release of the largest quantity of a listed toxic substance that\n           is estimated to generate the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint defined in the \n          112(r) regulation.

In addition, work is underway to mitigate a potential spill\n     at the railcar off-loading area.\n\n     Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n        7 CS2 is discharged from a 3\" process pipe due to a gasket rupture, but the amount released is limited \n          by operator action.\n\n     The Offsite Consequence Analysis of the chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air \n     dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  Air dispersion modeling is the use of a computer to\n     simulate the spread of air pollutants.  Dispersion modeling can be used to determine the movement and \n     concentration of toxic gases emitted from an accidental release.  In both the worst-case and alternative\n     Offsite Consequence Analysis modeling cases, \"worst-case\" weather conditions were used to \n     simulate poor dispersion of the chemical, even though the 112(r) rule allows the use of more favorable\n     dispersion conditions, such as increased wind speeds and a greater dilution factor, for the Alternative \n     Release Scenario analysis. The topography surrounding the FLEXSYS operations will frequently \n     contribute to poor dispersion conditions, especially at night and through early morning. Therefore, use \n     of \"worst-case\" meteorology is prudent."

This written information \n          enables FLEXSYS and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand \n          the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances.  Minimum information \n          includes hazards data such as that found on a Material Safety Data Sheet, technology information, \n          and equipment information.\n\n        7 Process hazard analysis:  A hazard evaluation has been performed by an experienced team to\n          identify, assess, and control the hazards involved in each of the covered areas.  The HAZOP and \n         \"what-if\" methodologies were used for determining and evaluating the hazards of the process.  The \n          analysis addressed the hazards of the process, the identification of any previous incident which \n          had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, engineering and administrative controls \n          applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection \n          methodologies to provide early warning of releases, consequences of failure of engineering and \n          administrative controls, stationary source siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of a \n          range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. These analyses are being updated \n          and revalidated on a five year basis.\n\n       7 Operating procedures: Written procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear \n         instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the\n         process safety information.  Elements that are addressed include steps for each operating phase, \n         operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.
