The Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority owns and operates the water plant.  The OOWA's interest in the employee - to provide proper equipment and working conditions to do the job safely.  The OOWA is also committed to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals to the environment.  Finally, the OOWA is committed to provide its employees the proper training and instruction to respond to emergencies.  2.  The MidAmerica Industrial Park and the regulated substances handled.  The MidAmerica Industrial Park Water Plant provides potable water for industries in the park and to surrounding communities.  The regulated chemical under Section 112(r) of the Federal Clean Air Act is chlorine.  3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.  In the RMP a worst-case release scenario was analyzed for chlorine stored in the largest container at the Water Plant.  The affected area would cover a residential area, golf course and a large part of the MidAmerica Industrial Park.  In addition to the worst-case scenario, an alternative release was conducted.  4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps.  The general accidental release prevention program includes proper operation and maintenance of safety equipment, chlorine detectors, the caustic scrubbing system and the emergency alarm system.  The chemical-specific prevention steps include the chlorine detection equipment and alarms.  5.  The five-year accident history.  There has been no accidents in the past five years.  6.  The Emergency Response Program.  The ERP has been written and discussed with the employees.  Each employee is 40-hr HAZWOPER certified and attends an annual 8-hr refresher course.  7.  Planned changes to improve safety.  The OOWA will continue to update and improve its operational procedures, maintenance schedules and s"
