Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of BrucePac to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \r\n\r\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \r\n\r\n1.20\tFacility Description And Substances Handled\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tBrucePac is a manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes meat products.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized team members, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n\u00bf\tThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\u00bf\tThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 31,000 pounds of anhyd"

There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\r\n\r\n1.30\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView 5 (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\r\n\r\n1.40\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nBrucePac complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \r\n\r\nBrucePac's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include team member participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the BrucePac Director of HR & Safety, as well as the Director of Mechanical Systems, or designee(s). \r\n\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each team member involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the"

This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \r\n\r\n1.50\tFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents at BrucePac in the past five years.\r\n\r\n1.60\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nBrucePac has a written Emergency Response Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.

This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Woodburn Fire Department.\r\n\r\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at BrucePac and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Alarm and Communication System\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Team\r\n\u00bf\tEvacuation Plans and Assembly Points\r\n\u00bf\tPersonal Protective Equipment\r\n\r\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Woodburn Fire Department, including the Salem HazMat Response Team stationed at the"
