After primary and secondary treatment, the water is disinfected with chlorine to eliminate any harmful bacteria and treated with sulfur dioxide to remove residual chlorine.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are both toxic, and the plant is committed to handling them safely and in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule and the State of Washington DOSH process safety management (PSM) standard.\n\n\n\nThe facility's PSM/RMP Manual describes a hazard assessment that evaluates offsite impact of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas release, a prevention program, and emergency action should a release occur.  The prevention program includes:\n\n+ A management system to assure that responsibilities are defined and performed\n\n+ Documentation of process safety information\n\n+ A process hazard analysis that identify hazards and safeguards to prevent incidents\n\n+ Safe operating procedures\n\n+ Training so employees can perform the procedures\n\n+ Preventive maintenance to keep equipment in good condition\n\n+ Procedures for reviewing safety impacts of changes to the process\n\n+ Pre-startup safety reviews for confirming that changes were made as intended\n\n+ Compliance audits at least every three years\n\n+ Investigating incidents if they occur\n\n+ Involving employees in process safety management activities\n\n+ Using hot work permits to prevent fires\n\n+ Contractor safety orientations\n\n\n\nThe plant has developed an emergency action plan and employees are trained to respond to incidental releases.  The City of Pullman Fire Department is available to respond to a release that exceeds the capabilities of plant employees.  Gas detectors are installed to provide warning of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  Automatic shutoff devices are installed to stop flow of chlorine or sulfur dioxide if a release is detected.\n\n\n\nThere have been no sig"
