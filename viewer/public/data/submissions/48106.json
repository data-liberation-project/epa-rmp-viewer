We anticipate the annual tonnage volume should be approximately 500 ton.  The site was de-registered on June 20, 2005 after setting idle for two years.  In the fall of 2006, the site was inspected by the Iowa Department of Agriculture in anticipation of being used in the spring of 2007.  After the required updates were done, the Iowa Department of Agriculture re-inspected and approved the site for use on October 4, 2006.  The inspector for the Iowa Department of Agriculture was Kevin Klommhaus."
