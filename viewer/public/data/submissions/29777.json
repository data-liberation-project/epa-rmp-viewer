Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. ethanol plant is located in Marcus, Cherokee County, Iowa.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Natural Gasoline, also known as Denaturant.  Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.6 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequences Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 560000 pounds of denaturant creating a toxic.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles fr"

There are two rural residence homes within the 0.6 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has numerous control in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3, an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was also prepared.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of denaturant.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P. ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of the facility activities.  Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.'s corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and a review of the facility's emergency response plan is pending."
