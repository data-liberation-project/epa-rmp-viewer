The act of material segregation and storage is integral to the safe storage and handling of ALL materials handled at the Facility.\n\nStaging/Loading/Delivery\nAs the Company receives orders for chemicals, the Dispatch Department works out the logistics for order fulfillment and delivery.  Again, pallet jacks or forklifts are utilized to move materials from the various building areas or storage rooms to the delivery dock.  The Operator checks the Delivery Order and ensures that the load is accurate.  The delivery truck driver then delivers the load to customer site.  The process of staging, loading and delivery is identical for each regulated substance handled at the facility.  The only difference being the container types and sizes and where the materials are delivered.  \n\nIt should be noted that pre-packed regulated substances are received in sealed containers, the containers remain sealed throughout the duration of their storage onsite, and the containers are delivered sealed to customers.  Furthermore, ALL regulated substances are stored indoors in locked, secured warehouse areas/rooms that have been pre-designated via a well thought out and planned materials handling and segregation process.  As such, only chemically compatible materials or like materials are stored in the same warehouse areas or rooms.  Storage areas for incompatible materials are separated by walls, or other barriers that would prevent material co-mingling in case of spills.\n\nSite Security\nALL buildings at the site are locked at all times and access is limited to authorized persons only.  Furthermore, the site is surrounded by completely enclosed and the entry gate is locked at all times.  Each of the chemical storage buildings are secured via locked entry doors.

These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for each of the regulated substances handled at the site.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios for each of the regulated substances handled at the facility are discussed below.\n\nHYDROFLUORIC ACID (70-PERCENT CONCENTRATED)\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nIn this scenario, a 550-pound container (e.g. a 55-gallon drum \u00bf the largest container size handled at the site) of 70-percent concentrated hydrofluoric acid stored on site experiences a catastrophic failure due to an unknown event.  This scenario could be initiated by an external event (i.e., an airplane, missile or meteorite impacting the area where the container is stored).  It is highly improbable that this scenario would be initiated by a seismic event.  However, the possibility of this scenario being initiated by a seismic event cannot be completely discarded (i.e., the structural failure of a wall, etc.).  This scenario is considered to be extremely unlikely.  In the extremely unlikely case that this scenario occurs, up to 550-pounds of 70-percent concentrated hydrofluoric acid could be released (in the worst-case).
