Ice Cube Cold Storage is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If an unpredictable release does occur, Ice Cube Cold Storage employs a trained refrigeration engineer, and coordinated with the Fall River Fire Department to assist in mitigating any release.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at Ice Cube Cold Storage has been designed and operates in accordance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and Local codes and regulations. Ice Cube Cold Storage has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the process, and the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process. The process is also designed and operated in voluntary compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management rule.\r\n\r\nThrough the Ice Cube Cold Storage Emergency Action Plan as required under OSHA PSM, IceCube Cold Storage has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the AccidentalRelease Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nIce Cube Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehouse and logistics facility primarily engaged in the refrigerated (cold storage) of seafood products.
