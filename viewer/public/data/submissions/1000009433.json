Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia. We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and,  has  instructed employees on  procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n    \n The anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facility was updated to comply with the Indiana State Ammonia Rules in 2003. Anhydrous ammonia is received by trucks and is stored in bulk and portable (nurse) tank"

      "SummaryText": "s. This   facility has equipment for unloading   transports and rail and equipment to load nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, and authorized contractors. \n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in bulk storage tanks at this plant is 121259 pounds. The maximum amount stored in portable nurse tanks is 261173 pounds. The maximum quantity handled, including the nurse tanks, would be 382432 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst case Scenario: Release of the total contents of the largest tank would be released as a gas over 10 minutes.  According to RMP Comp modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario: According to RMP Comp modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. \n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility's anhydrous ammonia plant has implemented the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111; \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; periodic inspections by the Indiana State Chemists Office are also conducted. Employees involved in anhydrous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by our Safety Coordinator, contractor and insurance companies, and industry experts; an annual formal refresher course (required by Indiana Law) as well as periodic training is also provided.  \n\nThe major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, over pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves,"

      "SummaryText": " manual shutoffs, Emergency shutoff valves, alarms and procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \n\nMitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would \"knock down\" the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia. In addition, passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 85% capacity (through tank gauges and onsite personnel) are utilized.\n\nEmployees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis. Employee Training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs. Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\n\nMaintenance programs are in place. Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date, or if a system or process is changed or upgraded. OSHA 1910.111 standards and Indiana State Ammonia Rules are used to identify those needs. The Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation). In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a nearly daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.\n\n\n5. Five-year accident history. \n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the last 5 years.  \n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 1910.38. We have coordinated response actions with the Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training. We have discussed this program with the County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and our facility is included in the county emergency plan. In the event of a release of regulated substances, our employees have been instructed on the procedures for notification of the"
