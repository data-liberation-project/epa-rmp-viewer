Midcoast shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMidcoast believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nMidcoast has chosen to delegate responsibility of emergency response to the appropriate agencies.  This Program Plan has been coordinated with the Hemphill LEPC and the Shamrock Fire Department.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nMidcoast Hobart Cryogenic Gas Plant processes a flammable mixture in their cryogenic process.  The maximum inventory at any one time is 119,340 lbs of an ethane/propane/iso-butane/butane/iso-pentane/pentane mixture.  The threshold for RMP is 10,000 lbs of a flammable substance.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 CFR 68.  The RMP*Comp modeling software was us"
