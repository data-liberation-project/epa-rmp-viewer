Tippin Water Treatment Facility (DLTWTF) formerly known as Hillsborough River Water Treatment Plant is located in Tampa, Florida.  DLTWTF utilizes an enhanced coagulation treatment process to produce potable water from the surface water stored in the Hillsborough River Reservoir.  Its operating hours are  24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  \n\nDLTWTF has been designed for the safe storage and handling of chlorine and ammonia as referenced in the Combined Process Safety Management Program for the City of Tampa Water Department, Production Division.  These are the only chemicals used in a process at this facility covered by the RMP rule.\n\nDLTWTF maintains an inventory of liquid chlorine in two 90 ton rail cars located within an enclosed chemical building.  Chlorine is used as the primary disinfectant in the potable water treatment process.  Secondary disinfection for potable water storage and distribution is achieved with chloramine (combining chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.    Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 2000 gallon horizontal pressurized tanks. Anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are filled only to 85% capacity (9,675 pounds each) as required under manufacturer specifications.  No accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five year period.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative case release\", and one \"alternative case release\" for anhydrous ammonia.  The \"worst case release\" scenario is defined by EPA as \"a chemical  release of the maximum quantity in the largest vessel released in a 10 minute period\", due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\"\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nRMP*Comp (Version 1.07)  was utilized in modeling the release scenarios.  All default settings in RMP*Comp were utilized in modeling the releasing scenarios.  The following section lists the release amount modeled in each scenario and the resulting estimated distance to toxic endpoint:\n\n*Chlorine Worst Case: 180,000 lbs released in enclosed space for 10 minutes (mitigated rate-99,000 lb/min); distance to endpoint: 9.9 miles\n*Chlorine Alternative Case: Mitigated rate of 13,365 lb/min with duration of 2 minutes; distance to endpoint: 0.6 miles\n*Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Case: 2,547 lbs released for 10 minutes; distance to endpoint: 0.1 miles\n\nIn determining the alternative case for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia releases, \"a rupture in piping\" was selected to be modeled.  The release for the chlorine release rate alternative scenario was then calculated by employing the release rate for \"flashing liquid releases\" as referenced in EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants;  EPA 550-B-98-010, equation (8), page 4-22 as:  QR= 3,140 X Ah (QR is the release rate in pounds per minute and Ah is the hole or puncture area in square inch).  A 55% mitigation factor was used for the chlorine building in both worst and alternative cases.  \n\nFor anhydrous ammonia alternative case release scenario, a rupture of a 2 inch diameter stainless steel transfer piping carrying ammonia gas was used.  As summarized in section 8.1 of the OCA Guidance manual, the release rate can be estimated by the following equation.\n\nQR= HA x  Pt x GF    = 254.7 #/min.\n            (Tt)**0.5\n\nQR= Release rate in pounds per minute\nHA= Hole or puncture area (sq in)= 3.1416 x (2**2)/4 = 3.14 sq in\nPt=   Tank Pressure (psia) = 100 psia for ammonia vapor pressure @ 25 degC\nTt=   Tank Temperature in degK = 273 + degC= 273 + 25= 298\nGF= Gas factor as indicated from Exhibit B-1, Appendix B of OCA Guidance manual= 14 for  anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe City of Tampa Water Department (TWD) Emergen"

      "SummaryText": "cy Response Plans include coordination with the City of Tampa Fire Department and City of Tampa emergency response units.  The facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated with the Tampa Fire Department, Emergency Operations Center for Hillsborough County, and the Local Emergency Planning Council Region 8.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and notification plan.  Operators are trained in the use of SCBA, and each operator has been issued and is trained in a class B chemical suit.  The facility has on line leak detectors for chlorine strategically located at storage and feed application points with audible alarms on the plant site, and computer alarm setpoints back to the SCADA control system in the operations control room.  Automatic air activated actuator valve shutdown devices are installed on railcar feed valves.  The actuators will automatically close chlorine rail car valves at the first detection of a chlorine leak.  Ammonia leak detectors are being evaluated on site for the same purpose of achieving automatic shutdown at the ammonia storage tank at first detection of an ammonia leak.  DLTWTF accidental release policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to adhere to all applicable federal and state prevention program guidelines.  As previously noted, TWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailed to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. \n\nThe TWD accidental release prevention program is based upon the following key elements:\n*DESIGNING for Safety...\n -Chlorine:\n     Chlorine rail car construction meets federal guideline 49CFR179.102.\n     Excessive-flow check valve prevents rapid release of rail car contents . \n     Chlorine rail car enclosed in containment building.\n     Containment building has high volume air blower.\n     Four automatic chlorine gas detector alarms.\n     Annunciator "
