This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe crude unit consists of two basic processes: thermal fractionation and vacuum fractionation. The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery. It is designed to take raw crude oil, remove salt and sediment, heat and factionate the crude into finished and intermediate products. The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator (VDF) tower and the vacuum tower. Negative pressure, a vacuum, is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Unit #26 is designed to process 18,000 BPD of diesel feed and to operate at 850 psig. The design basis provides for a \"future case\" where the unit can process cracked feedstocks at more severe conditions although numerous modifications will still need to be made to do this. As currently designed, the unit will process straight run diesel feeds from the crude unit. The ULSD process combines hydrogen with the straight run diesel feeds, and processes them in a high pressure reactor filled with specialty catalyst. The reaction produces H2S, which is then separated from the diesel stream and removed from the process through amine scrubbing. The amine/H2S mixture is recycled to the sulfur recovery plant and processed into molten sulfur. The unit is expected to consume 6-7 MMSCFD of 220 psig  hydrogen and is designed to reduce the sulfur in the diesel from 6,800 ppm to less than 15 ppm.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Non-essential personnel will be evacuated to more remote locations outside the main refinery.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables: isobutane, butane, pentane, propane, and flammable mixtures.  In addition, the refinery uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic substance.  Other toxic substances common to refineries were evaluated; hydrogen sulfide, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and mercaptans do not exceed their respective threshold quantities and therefore are not reported.\n\n\n\nCrude/Vacuum Unit\n\n\n\nThe Crude/Vacuum Unit consists of two processes.  The Crude Unit is the initial process unit in the refinery, and is designed to remove salt and sediment from raw crude oil then heat and fractionate the crude into finished and intermediate products.  The Vacuum Unit is designed to process crude tower bottoms in the vacuum diesel fractionator tower and the vacuum tower.  Negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum) is required to fractionate this heavy material without forming coke.  The Crude Unit is Program Level 3 because of regulated flammable mixtures.  The calculated weight of the flammable mixtures stored in this unit is 74,000 pounds (lbs). \n\n\n\n#1 Reformer/Naphtha HDS Unit\n\n\n\nThe #1 Reformer/Naphtha Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Unit c"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes, to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) performed at Cherry Point will be via either hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) or What-If Checklist studies.  The HAZOP and What-If Checklist processes are based on the principle that a team approach to hazard analysis will identify more problems than when individuals work separately and combine results.  The PHA team is comprised of individuals with varying backgrounds and expertise brought together to thoroughly review the process hazards through collective brainstorming.\n\n\n\nThe team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation measures is tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, tracked to completion, and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\nOPERA"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow the site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they encounter during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery conducts a process startup safety review for any new facility or facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A safety review involves field verification of the construction and provides quality assurance by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent system"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage process changes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls will not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training for the change.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nThe refinery promptly and thoroughly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

The frequency of accidental releases has been extremely low. The refinery has not had any release that has gone outside of the refinery boundaries. There have not been any OSHA recordable injuries resulting from a flammable release or a toxic release in the past five years. Every incident is investigated carefully and changes are instituted to prevent such an incident from happening again.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery has implemented an emergency response program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.  The goal of the program is to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures, as necessary, to perform their specific emergency response duties. \n\n\n\nThe ERP includes a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia), acci"

The ICS has a hierarchical (i.e., chain-of-command) structure that places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position within the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency; as the scope and complexity of an emergency expands, so does the ICS.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the BP Cherry Point Refinery is coordinated with the Whatcom County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The refinery has emergency response organizations, providing a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency drills that involve the emergency response organizations.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe BP Cherry Point Refinery"
