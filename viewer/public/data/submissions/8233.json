THE OWNER, MAMAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF UAP NORTHERN PLAINS, JAMESTOWN ND, ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OOCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, LEPC, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PROMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\nB. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION ON CROPS AS A FERTILIZER NUTRIENT.\n\nC. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY STORED WOULD BE 131,580 POUNDS IN A 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. (Note: maximum quanity allowed to be stored is 85% of the storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 131,580 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 2.41 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS .72 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILTY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\nB. THE FACILTY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nV. THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nA. SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILTY. PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PREFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS AND EVALUATE EMPLOYEE TRAINING. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS TIME."
