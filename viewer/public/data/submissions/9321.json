Pilot Chemical is committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9002.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\n\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Middletown Plant occupies 27 acres in an open, relatively flat, combination rural and industrial area, southwest of Middletown, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1984 with building additions in 1995 and process additions in 1995 and 1998.  The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through continuous sulf(on)ation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial and personal care markets.\n\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics, and Isopropylamine which is a flammable liquid.\n\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of 14oF.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur Dioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm.  With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with a odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.  Sulfur Dioxide is stable and non-flammable in either the gaseous or liquid state.\n\nSulfur Trioxide is a clear, colorless, oily liquid at temperatures between its freezing and boiling points, which are 90oF and 113oF respectively.  Sulfur Trioxide has a strong irritating odor and is very hygroscopic, reacting violently with water.  Sulfur Trioxide fumes react with the moisture in the air to form a dense, white cloud of "

This mist is extremely irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\n\nIsopropylamine is a colorless, water-white, highly flammable liquid with a strong ammoniacal odor.  Isopropylamine evaporates readily evolving vapor that is heavier than air and easily ignited.  Isoproplyamine is completely soluble in water and will not ignite at a concentration below 25%.\n\nIndustries and residences are at least 600 feet from the main building containing the sulfonation processes and from  the Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide storage tanks.   The Isopropylamine storage tank is 400 feet from the nearest industrial area and residence and 200 feet from the process building.\n\nThe worst case toxic substance scenario is failure of a Sulfur Trioxide tank truck containing 35,000 lbs during the unloading process.  The Sulfur Trioxide is spilled into a 195 sq ft sump at the end of the concrete unloading dike.  Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating Sulfur Trioxide reacting with the moisture in the air would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  The scenario was modeled using the USEPA Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Guidance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Trioxide is a failure of the tank truck unloading boom from a flange gasket or piping rupture during unloading of a tank truck.  The Sulfur Trioxide is released at a flow rate of 50 gallons per minute into a 195 sq ft sump at the end of the concrete unloading dike for two minutes before the Emergency Shutdown system is activated.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating Sulfur Trioxide reacting with the moisture in the air would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.

The liquid Sulfur Dioxide (under pressure) is released at a rate of 30 gallons per minute for 3 minutes before the Emergency Shutdown system is activated.  The Sulfur Dioxide is assumed to form a pool with a depth of 1 cm which completely vaporizes within 10 minutes.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating Sulfur Dioxide would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  The scenario was modeled using the USEPA Risk Management Program Offsite Consequence Guidance.\n\nThe worst case flammable substance scenario is catastrophic failure of the 6200 gallon, Isopropylamine storage tank.  The entire contents of the tank instantaneously vaporizes and ignites resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The endpoint of 1 psi overpressure would reach nearby, offsite public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Isopropylamine is catastrophic failure of the 6200 gallon storage tank releasing the entire contents into a concrete dike with subsequent ignition.  The resulting pool fire endpoint of 5 kilowatts per square meter would reach nearby industrial receptors but would not reach residential areas.\n\nThis facility has in place an accidental release prevention program that complies with all of the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  In addition:\n7 Sensitive Sulfur Dioxide and flammable vapor detection systems are installed with monitors located in strategic locations throughout the processing areas to alert plant personnel of leaks.\n7 The facility undergoes annual safety inspections by the Middletown Fire Department and our insurance company.\n7 Before beginning any maintenance operation involving hot work, a Hot Work permit must be completed and signed by both production and engineering.\n7 The computer controlled processes are \"Fail safe\" and include emergency shutdown capability that close isolation valves and stop chemical transfers to effectively limit the extent of a release.

Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal and process safety.\n7 All incidents are investigated, including very small drips and leaks, and actions are taken to prevent recurrence.\n7 An extensive mechanical integrity program is in place which includes equipment preventive maintenance schedules, vessel thickness testing, relief system inspections and instrumentation calibration.\n7 Pre-startup reviews are held prior to starting new or modified equipment per OSHA standards.\n7 Routine audits of operating procedures and work instructions are conducted to assure that safe practices are followed.\nThis facility has had no reportable accidents with off site consequences within the past 5 years.  In addition no onsite reportable injuries involving Sulfur Dioxide, Sulfur Trioxide or Isopropylamine have occurred since startup of the facility in 1984.\n\nBecause we believe that in the event of a chemical accident quick response is necessary to minimize the likelihood of onsite or offsite injuries, an extensive emergency response plan has been developed.  In addition to the written plan:\n7 All employees receive annual training on the use of the emergency response and evacuation plans, use of personal protective equipment, operation of fire extinguishers and spill mitigation techniques.\n7 Currently, 9 plant personnel are trained at the 40 hour industrial emergency responder Technician level.

This update will be completed by August 1, 1999.  The new system will also include advanced security features and more sophisticated process upset alarming.\n7 Installing a flammable gas detector in the Isopropylamine storage tank dike to allow early detection of leaks.\n7 Replacing the Sulfur Dioxide transfer pumps with a sealless pump design.\n7 Installing barriers in the process area to prevent inadvertent forklift damage to process vessels containing Sulfur Trioxide.\n7 All mechanics and lead operators not currently trained will receive industrial emergency responder Technician level training within the next two years."
