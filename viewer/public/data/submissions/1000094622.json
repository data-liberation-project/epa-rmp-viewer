The RMP/PSMP has been prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk management program requirements described in 40 CFR Part 68 and the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management requirements described in 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following chemicals are being used at the WWTF:  \r\n\r\n1.\tChlorine\r\n2.\tSodium Hydroxide (caustic)BELOW THE THRESHOLD\r\n3.\tSodium Hypochlorite BELOW THE THRESHOLD\r\n\r\nOf these chemicals, only chlorine is listed as Highly Hazardous Chemicals in the EPA and OSHA standards (refer to List of RMP Regulated Substances in Appendix B).  Chlorine is stored at the WWTF in the amount that exceeds the listed threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for Loxahatchee River Environmental Control District Wastewater Treatment Facility are structured to reduce the risk of injury to employees and the public, from the accidental release of the regulated chemical chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine gas is used for effluent disinfection and is stored in ton containers in an enclosed building.  The chlorine building is kept closed at all times to contain any accidental releases.  There is a scrubber to actively mitigate any accidental release of chlorine contaminant up to 2000 pounds.  The scrubber is checked to see if it is operating during every work shift at the facility.  There are six chlorine leak detectors placed throughout the inside of the chlorine building to provide warning of any chlorine release."

      "SummaryText": "rnative release scenario were developed using the EPA's RMP*Comp. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the facility is based on the release of an entire 2,000-pound cylinder of chlorine over a period of 10 minutes.  This scenario could have hazardous effects up to 0.9 miles downwind of the vessel.  Within 0.9 miles of the facility, there are homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, recreation areas and day care centers that could be affected by the worst-case release.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for a chlorine release is based on a valve failure on a chlorine storage vessel.  This scenario could have hazardous effects up to 0.1 miles downwind of the vessel.  \r\n\r\nThe facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  Response to chlorine releases of 3 ppm or above is handled by Palm Beach County Hazmat/fire rescue.  The facility has established procedures for contacting them in such instances.  The facility will attempt to mitigate minor chemical releases (i.e., under 3 ppm within the chlorine building) and has established procedures to do so."
