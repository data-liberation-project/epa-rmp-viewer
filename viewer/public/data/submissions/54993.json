      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) was developed by Earth Sciences Consultants, Inc. (Earth Sciences) for Allegheny Ludlum Corporation's Brackenridge facility located at 100 River Road, Leechburg, Pennsylvania, and is pursuant to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\nProcess Description and Regulated Substances.\nThe Brackenridge Facility has designed and operates a process for the storage and transfer of 70 percent hydrofluoric acid (HF) into process tubs.  The process includes a 12,000-gallon storage tank located in a designated acid storage area and piping used to supply 70 percent HF to the process tubs.  The storage, handling, and use of 70 percent HF at the plant is hereafter referred to as \"Process No. 1\" in the remainder of this document.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the facility is 331111.  The Brackenridge Facility process is classified as a Tier II program since the facility is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Brackenridge Facility has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of hydrofluoric acid.  The Brackenridge Facility remains committed to the prevention of releases of hydrofluoric acid.  In the event of a release, the Brackenridge Facility is committed to a timely response in accordance with their Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan and the applicable components of this RMP.  Accident prevention and emergency response programs are described in this RMP.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Brackenridge Facility has safe job procedures (SJP) in place:\n\n- to evaluate the HF tank capacity and volume already in place before unloading begins;\n- to describe the use of HF in the facility's manufacturing operations; and\n- for the inspection of pr"

Finally, the Facility maintains the ongoing mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases associated with these processes in the last five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Brackenridge facility maintains a PPC Plan/Spill Prevention Response/(SPR) Plan.  The Brackenridge Facility has trained employees for an initial response team.  This team will don personal protective equipment (PPE) and be dispatched to control or stop a minor emergency or an accidental release or help move any employee(s) that has been affected by a 70 percent HF release.  If necessary, employees will be evacuated to a safe zone.\n\nIn the event of an emergency where off-site response is appropriate, it will be the policy of the Brackenridge Facility to notify the Brackenridge Fire Department and/or the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and request that they respond to the emergency.  A fire, explosion, or other occurrence with the potential to create a release of the regulated substance (HF) from the process may pose a danger to public emergency responders.   Public emergency responders will not be permitted to enter this area except as previously arranged with the Primary Emergency Coordinator (PEC) or other designated personnel, as identified within this RMP.\n\nFinally, the Brackenridge Facility has an equipped emergency control center.  The emergency control center is sited in a safe zone and serves as the major communication link between the PEC and plant or corpo"

If reasonable measures are subsequently identified that would lower the risk of an off-site release, such measures will be implemented.\n\nResponsible Person\nI, Deborah L. Calderazzo, Director of Environmental Affairs, have been assigned as the qualified person with the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP and subsequent program elements for the Brackenridge facility of the Allegheny Ludlum Corporation.\n\nCurrently, I have the responsibility for implementing the individual requirements of this RMP.  Should this responsibility be assigned to another person (or persons) other than myself, the names and positions of these people will be documented and the lines of authority will be defined through an organization chart or similar document. \n\nI certify that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted here is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nName:  Deborah L.
