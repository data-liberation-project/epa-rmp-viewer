We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator located in Ascension Parish, Louisiana is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.\n\nThe Tebone Fractionator receives mixed natural gas liquids (raw make) via pipeline. This raw make is fed to the plant fractionation process comprised of a feed system, Deethanizer, Depropanizer, Debutanizer, Butane Splitter and Tank Storage. In addition, there is a Refrigeration system that is used on the Deethanizer for ethane/propane vapor condensing. The finished natural gas liquids products are shipped out via pipeline, transport trucks or rail cars.\n\nThe NGL Fractionation process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facil"

Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Tebone Fractionation Plant are raw make, propane, isobutane, normal butane, natural gasoline and ethyl mercaptan. Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the plant for use as an LPG odorant. The actual amount of ethyl mercaptan in storage is usually kept at a minimum unless a favorable market price results in extra purchase.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Tebone Fractionation Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Tebone Fractionation Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activitie"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Tebone Fractionation Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers\n* Plant fire water system\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Tebone Fractionation Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fi"

      "SummaryText": "re or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Tebone Fractionation Plant is coordinated with the Ascension Parish Emergency Management organization (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Tebone Fractionation Plant has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Tebone Fractionation Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Tebone Fractionation Plant provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Tebone Fractionation Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Tebone Fractionation Plant.\n\n* Additional gas detection is being added."
