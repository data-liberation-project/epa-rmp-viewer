The end use of Isobutane is for the purpose of charging refrigerators and freezers at the Ottawa plant.  \n\n\n\n(a): Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at source,\n\n\n\nAccident Prevention:\n\nThe AST/Bulkhead is protected to the East and South by a large retention pond with a driveway/parking area to the North and West.\n\n\n\nA 8' chain link fence has been installed around the main property with a coded gate and around the AST/Bulkhead to prevent unauthorized access,\n\n\n\nJersey barriers have been installed every 6' to eliminate an accidental or intentional vehicle strike,\n\n\n\nAn emergency shutoff is located on the tank, bulkhead and various locations throughout the systems including at the end use, charging station.\n\n\n\nA handheld LEL/O2 meter is used during offloading and repair operations. It's bump tested per/use with the technician trained in its use including proper placement for monitoring.\n\nIn the event of a fire, the tanks have a certified 3 stage relief/blow off valve in place to prevent a BLEVE.\n\n\n\nThere are Drager PIR 7000 OV/LEL meters placed and various positions within the tank, bulkhead and charging cells. They are set to alarm at 10% of the LEL and at 25% level it automaticly implements a flow shutdown of the Isobutane. It also send a signal to the security desk who would immediacy notify the shift Emergency Coordinator.\n\n\n\nOnly trained and authorized personnel are permitted to enter the AST's exclusion zone.\n\n\n\nAll tools shall be non-sparking with radios/cell phones certified to use in a Zone 2, Group 2, A zone.\n\n\n\nThere are flags located on the south side of the facility and a  wind direction sock mounted on the roof which will be used for the purpose of guiding evacuees and/or First Responders. \n\n\n\nAccident Prevent"
