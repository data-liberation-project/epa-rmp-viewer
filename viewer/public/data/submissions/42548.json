Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia\n\nrefrigeration system following its RMP Program. The RMP Program was developed in 1991\n\nto comply with New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act. The Standard Operating\n\nProcedures, Preventative Maintenance Program, Management of Change Program, Emergency\n\nResponse Plan, and other elements of the RMP Program have developed over the years to\n\nfurther improve the safety, reliability, and risk reduction of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n                      Johanna Foods, Inc.\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has three production plants on one site. The Juice Plant packages\n\nchilled juice products in half gallon, quart and pint paper containers that require refrigeration\n\nfor processing and storage. The Aseptic Plant packages juice products in Brik Pak containers\n\n(drink boxes) in a variety of sizes and flavors that requires refrigeration for processing but not\n\nfor storage. The Yogurt Plant packages yogurt products in cup containers of various sizes,\n\nstyles, and flavors that require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia\n\nis the regulated chemical that is used as the refrigerant. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia\n\ncontained in the refrigeration system  on site varies up to 55,000 pounds. The anhydrous\n\nammonia is not consumed or produced by the refrigeration system. The refrigeration system\n\ncirculates the anhydrous ammonia converting it from a liquid to a vapor to create cooling, then\n\ncondensing the vapor back to a liquid to be used again. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia refrigeration system following its RMP\n\nProgram developed in 1991 to comply with New Je"

      "SummaryText": "rsey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.\n\nThe Standard Operating Procedures are used for every task performed on the refrigeration\n\nsystem. All equipment is checked daily using checksheets from the S.O.P.'s Steady State\n\nOperations section. The Preventative Maintenance Program requires checksheets to inspect all\n\nrefrigeration equipment in greater detail every six months, yearly testing of all safety\n\ninterlocks and controls, and a five year schedule to replace safety relief valves. Any repairs\n\nrequired by the inspections are tracked with a PC based Work Order System. Any\n\nmodification to the system is performed following the Management of Change Program. The\n\nM.O.C. requires a dispersion analysis to determine if the change could cause offsite impact or\n\nnot. Offsite impact would result in performing a risk assessment of the change to identify all\n\nhazards and items to further reduce the risk of a release. All EHS operators are trained in all\n\naspects of the RMP and annual refresher training is performed high lighting any changes to\n\nprocedures or equipment.\n\n\n\n                   Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\n     There have been no accidents.\n\n\n\n                    Emergency Response Plan\n\n  \n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan that\n\naddresses emergency situations including an anhydrous ammonia\n\nrelease. This description will address procedures for an\n\nanhydrous ammonia release. There are procedures to follow for\n\nanyone who discovers a potential release to notify the Johanna\n\nFoods, Inc. guard shack. The guard would notify an EHS operator,\n\nby radio, to investigate the potential release. If the EHS\n\noperator finds a release he notifies the guard to sound the\n\nammonia release evacuation alarm that sounds in the effected\n\narea. The site personnel evacuate the area, lead by an Evacuation\n\nCoordinator (EVC), who upon meeting at the designated evacuation\n\narea, conducts a headcount. The guard also follows procedures to\n\nnotify the Emergency Respon"

The ERT members at\n\nthe effected area don SCBAs and perform a search of the effected\n\narea. The ERC radios the EVC by radio for the result of the\n\nheadcount and informs the response team of any missing personnel\n\nto search for. The ERC follows the Emergency Response Plan which\n\nincludes procedures on how to contact local emergency responders\n\nsuch as police, fire department, rescue squad, and LEPC. Once all\n\npersonnel and accounted for the EHS operators of the ERT start to\n\nisolate the release and monitor the area. The ERT is made up of\n\nEHS operators, production operators who have first aid training,\n\nand various maintenance personnel to assist in an emergency. Site\n\npersonnel are trained annually on the evacuation procedures. The\n\nERT is trained annually on the procedures of the Emergency\n\nResponse Plan and the use of Emergency Response Equipment. One\n\nrollout drill is conducted per year.\n\n\n\n       Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. follows the RMP to maintain the refrigeration system in a safe\n\nmanner. Any additions to the system are performed using the Management of Change\n\nprocedure to ensure that all new equipment is installed in the safest configuration. The five\n\nyear Risk Assessments also analysis all equipment and procedures to ensure that all actions are\n\ntaken to reduce the risk of any accidental releases.\n\n"
