If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Sorrento Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Additional emergency response can be obtained through the St. Amant Fire Department, if necessary.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a cryogenic plant that receives refinery off gas from the adjacent Convent Refinery.  The refinery off gas is liquefied in the cryogenic unit.  The design rate for off gas processing is 32 MMSCF/day.  This liquefied gas will be transmitted offsite via pipeline.  Methane and hydrogen gas components of the off gas are returned to the refinery. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of a flammable hydrocarbon mixture from the total failure of a 5,000-gallon surge tank.   The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a 5,000-gallon tank (18,354 lbs) is completely released. According to results using EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Reference Tables or Equations, the distance to the overpressure endpoint for this quantity of a flammable mixture is 0.24 miles.  Distance to the endpoint was calculated using methods described in Section 5.2 of the EPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  This distance to the endpoint for the mixture was used as the endpoint for all individual flammable components.  The facility is located in a rural area and would affect facility personnel and an unknown number of personnel and at an adjacent industrial facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the rupture of the piping that feeds the surge tank.  It is estimated that approximately 1,207 pounds of the mixture would be released before facility personnel could discover the leak and block off the pipeline"

A yield factor of 3 percent was used in the calculation of the alternative scenario.  This distance to the endpoint for the mixture was used as the endpoint for all individual flammable components.  The alternative scenario release of this mixture would affect facility personnel and an unknown number of personnel and at an adjacent industrial facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule, OSHA\u00bfs PSM rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  \n\nFive-year accident history.  Gulf Liquids New River Project LLC, Convent Gas Plant, has never had an accident involving butane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving a flammable hydrocarbon mixture, it is our policy to notify the Sorrento Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  When necessary, additional emergency response support has been arranged with the St. Amant Fire Department."
