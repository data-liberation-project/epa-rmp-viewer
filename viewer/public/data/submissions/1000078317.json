(OHLP) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  OHLP management goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Medford Fractionator is one of many facilities operated by OHLP.  Natural gas liquids (demethanized raw feed) are received at the site from natural gas facilities as feedstock totaling 220,000 barrels per day nominally.  The liquid feed to the facility is split into five product streams in a series of fractionator columns:  E-P Mix, Propane, Isobutane, Normal Butane, and Natural Gasoline.  These five product streams are further purified to remove contaminants such as water and carbon dioxide. Purity products are stored and distributed to various customers via pipeline. \n\n\n\nPropane, Butane, and Isobutane are stored at the facility in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.).  There are also three flammable mixtures, containing greater than 1% of an RMP substance, which are stored at the facility in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity.  These are Demethanized Raw Feed, EP Mix, and Natural Gasoline.  T"

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by OHLP.  These high standards include:\n\n- Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n- Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n- Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n- Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Medford Fractionator is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n- Providing overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.  Additionally, level transmitters and alarms are present on all vessels in order to prevent overfilling.\n\n- Providing a Raw Feed Diversion to reduce potential incidents.\n\n- Testing of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n- Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a vapor recovery unit and a pilot-lit flare for emergencies. \n\n- Providing containment berms around aboveground storage tanks.\n\n- Installing hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the facility.\n\n- Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing a fire water system thro"

The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Grant County LEPC.  The Medford Fractionator Incident Commander is responsible for coordinating the initial emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    \n\nContinued compliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n    \n\n- The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n- The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n- The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\n"
