Accidental Release prevention and emergancy responce policies.\r\n\r\n          The employees of the City of Azle water treatment plant routinely handle chlorine gas as a disinfectant.  Because the quantities of chlorine gas on hand often exceed the threshold of 40 CFR part 68, appendix A and the EPA considers chlorine a hazardous substance, we are required to operate in accordance with an approved Risk Management Program.\r\n          The same properties that make chlorine useful also make it necessary to observe certain precautions when transporting, storing  or handling this substance. It is our policy to adhere to federal and state safety rules and regulations to prevent unnecessary exposure and health risks to plant operators, contractors, venders and the citizens living in close proximity to the water plant.\r\n           The safe use of chlorine gas depends on the manor in which it is handled, the inherent safety features  in the design of the water plant, adhering to the operational procedures for using chlorine gas, the maintanance of the system and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance handled\r\n\r\n          The sole purpose of this facility is to supply potable water to the City of Azle.  This process includes the removal of contaminants from the water and disinfecting the water before it is used. Chlorine is used in this process to destroy possible pathogens, controlong taste and odor and the oxidizing of iron for removal.\r\n          Chlorine is delivered to the water plant in 1-ton containers by the vender. The empty container is removed from the chlorine room and is replaced with a full container.  A overhead hoist is used to move the containers between the chlorine room and the vender's truck.  Access to the chlorine room is restricted to authorized personnel.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on hand at the water plant can be 4000 pounds in two 1-ton containers.\r\n\r\n3.  The worst case release"

It is assumed the 2000 pounds of chlorine would be released over a period of ten minutes and as a gas, which is heaver than air.  The end point is determined to be 1.3 miles and will extend beyond the boundaries of the water plant.\r\n          An alternative release is the rupture of a container while unloading from the vender's truck.  In this scenario the release would be a liquid flashing to a vapor and the container would be emptied in just a few seconds. The end point would be 1.3 miles and would extend beyond the boundaries of the water plant.\r\n\r\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\n          This facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state coads and regulations.  Additionally, this facility follows standard procedures developed from manufacturing operating instructions and the Chlorine Institute guidance.\r\n\r\n5.  Five year accident history\r\n\r\n          This facility has not had a reportable release or injury involving chlorine gas during the past five years."
