These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: chlorine, 2,000 pounds; phosphorous oxychloride, 38,000 pounds; 37% formaldehyde  70,000 pounds,  12% oleum, 27,000 pounds and hydrochloric acid (37% solution), 70,000 pounds and 3000 lbs of anhydrous hydrochloric acid in tube trailers.\nChlorine is a gas that is delivered and maintained in cylinders, anhydrous hydorchloric acid is deliveredand used from 3000 pound tubes, 12% oleum is a solution stored in a 3000 gallon vessel, phosphorous oxychloride is a liquid stored in a  gallon vessel while hydrochloric acid solution and 37% formaldehyde are  liquids that are stored in an 8000 gallon tanks.  Only one cylinder of chlorine is used at a time to feed the raw material to a batch.  In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA worst-case release scenario for chlorine, a cylinder leaks and releases 2000 pounds of chlorine  gas (the entire contents of the pressurized cylinder) in 10 minutes.  The impact distance hypothetically could be up to 1.3 miles during the worse possible weather conditions.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\nFor hydrochloric acid solution, a tank rupture causes the release of 40,000 pounds.  (The amount of material in the 8000 gallon tank is limited to 7200 gallons by written operating procedures and high-level alarms.)  The liquid spills into a dike around the tank and evaporates over 10 minutes.  The concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of a pool.

The Engineering Department generates a list of safety systems and engineering controls (i.e., interlocks, pressure relief devices, computer alarms and controls) which are used during a project.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  The Production Project Coordinator, Safety Department, Engineering , Production, and Customer representatives conduct a Process Hazard Analysis for each project.  Administrative control of the projects is maintained by the use of a Production Batch Record for each batch that is produced, Production Shift Supervisor Checklists for each shift, and Production Coordinator weekly production reports.  Facility siting concerns are reviewed using a checklist developed by the Engineering Department.  Human factors are covered during the PHA.  The Production Department has established Standard Operating Procedures for corrective action systems for both ISO 9002 and 14001.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Production Coordinators write Batch Records for each project.

The Production Department  develops procedures for emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup after an emergency; these are included in the batch records.  The R&D Department also generates limits for temperature and pressure that are incorporated into the batch records.  The Safety Department reviews the MSDS for each raw material and product, and the information is put into a batch record safety sheet which uses a standard format to make it easier for operators to locate needed information.  Raw material and product specifications are developed to maintain materials quality control.\n\nTraining:  The Production Project Coordinator conducts initial training for Production and R&M employees before each project starts.  Refresher training is conducted prior to successive production campaigns.\n\nContractors:  Contractors use Albemarle, Tyrone Plant Emergency evacuation procedures and safety permits, and Albemarle, Tyrone Plant informs contractors of work and unique process hazards.  Contractors attend Albemarle, Tyrone Plant safety training programs and also have their own job training programs.  The Engineering and Safety Departments conduct periodic evaluations of the safety programs and performance for each contractor company.\n\nPreStartup Safety Review:  A series of checklists are developed and implemented to ensure that all appropriate items are reviewed before projects are started.  The Production Project Coordinator develops a list of recommendations from the PHA, and the recommendations are resolved before the project is started.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  The R&M Department has developed Standard Operating Procedures for Preventive Maintenance, and personnel are assigned to conduct the various PM items.  The PM system is also a part of the ISO 9002 and 14001 systems, and these systems are each audited two times a year by third party auditors.  The R&M Department conducts an annual shutdown ea"

The R&M Department has developed and implemented a quality assurance program for various types of equipment to ensure that replacement parts meet initial design requirements (replacement in kind).\n\nHot Work Permit:  The Safety Department has developed and implemented a Hot Work Permit which is used by all Albemarle, Tyrone Plant and contractor employees.  Other permits (i.e., Line Breaking, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, Safe Work, Elevated Work) are also implemented.\n\n\nManagement of Change Procedure:  Standard Operating Procedures are developed and implemented to describe when this procedure applies.  If a change is needed for a project, the Project Coordinator initiates an MOC Procedure, and the MOC is reviewed by the appropriate personnel.  The hard copy of the MOC is maintained in Production, and the MOC is also tracked in our computer network.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure:  The Production Shift Supervisor generates the initial incident report following any accident, incident, or close call.  An investigation is held to identify root causes and to propose corrective actions.  These suggestions are added to a computer tracking system where the are monitored until they are resolved.  Information is shared with appropriate employees at the plant and at other company locations.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response:  The Safety and Environmental Departments have developed several emergency response plans for the site.  Training and drills are conducted to ensure the plans are understood and followed.\n\nAudits:  Process Hazard Analyses are conducted prior to each new campaign, and at least every five years for repetitive projects which last more than five years.  Batch records are continuously reviewed and updated to ensure they are accurate and the production employees are following them.  The Corporate Safety Department conducts "

The Emergency Response Plan is updated to reflect any facility changes, and is coordinated with the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Annually, all employees receive training in their duties under the plan, and the evacuation plan is practiced at least once each year.  Each shift has a trained Emergency Response Team, that is equipped to respond to fires, spills and releases, and medical emergencies.  Each Team is comprised of employees and is led by its shift supervisor, who assumes the role of Incident Commander during any on-site emergency.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant emergency response personnel receive appropriate training (i.e., confined space rescue, SCBA, fire fighting, spill response); some members are also certified in CPR and first aid response.  Drills are conducted at least twice/year for each crew's response personnel.  The safety department determines the scenario for each drill.  After the drill is completed, it is critiqued; the findings and recommendations are used to help design future drills and training exercises.  Using this approach, each Team addresses specific response areas that need improvement.\n\nAll production and maintenance employees are also trained to respond to spills and releases, and all employees receive training in the use of hand held fire extinguishers to extinguish incipient stage fires.  In addition, the facility is protected with a foam sprinkler system, and is also equipped with several outdoor fire monitors and wheeled fire extinguishers that may be used in the event of a larger fire.  In addition to this emergency response training, all employees are instructed t"

We provide periodic orientation and informational tours for off-site response personnel.  These training sessions are often conducted in conjunction with the addition of new equipment and/or a new chemistry to the facility.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant Emergency Response Teams also conduct training and emergency response drills in conjunction with the City of Tyrone and Blair County response organizations.  The 1993 Blair County mock drill was conducted at Albemarle, Tyrone Plant; it involved a spill from a bulk tank and a fire.  In 1996, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant participated in a chlorine release drill with Tyrone fire companies; this scenario is similar to the chlorine worst-case release scenario identified in this plan.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nSeveral changes are being planned to help improve safety.  Additional members of response teams will be trained at the Delaware State Fire School; we attempt to send several employees each year.  First Responder training has been completed by several employees, our intention is to send additional employees to First Responder training .  A \"Corrective Action Team\" is being organized to investigate and address potential point source ventilation issues.  In addition, on a routine basis, we assess the effectiveness of many of our plans,  programs, and activities; and develop and implement action plans to address any deficiencies."
