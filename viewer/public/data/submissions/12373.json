      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response:\nThe Richmond Water Treatment facility has an ongoing training program including chemical handling and storage, use of SCBA's, CPR training and instruction on proceedures including chlorine container change-over. There is also in place a recently developed operator/management evaluation of proceedures and equipment.\nFacility regulated substances handled:\nRichmond Water Treatment plant is a facility that uses chemicals in the treatment process of potable water. Included in these chemicals is chlorine (a regulated substance). Approximately 3,000 pounds of chlorine is routinely stored at the plant. Chlorine is commonly used in the disinfection process of treatment.\nWorst case and accident scenario:\nThe worst case scenario would be a 2,000 pound release of chlorine in a 10 minute period of time. The offsite impact could invole about 100 residents. The alternative scenario would be a 1,000 pound release in a 10 minute time period. This scenario could have an offsite impact of about 100 residents.\nGeneral accidental release program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nPromote training of operators in the safe handling of chlorine and related equipment, establish and maintain preventitive maintenance schedule on all equipment, training in recognition of a potential problem with chlorine containers and feed equipment, and on-going training and awareness programs.\nEmergency resonse program:\nAt the onset of a potential emergency, the city emergency response plan is put into effect. This serves to coordinate the plant staff with fire and rescue, law enforcement and administration.\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nContinued safety promotion, training new operators, refresher training for existing operators, rededication to operator/management programs, evaluation of equipment and proceedures program, and preventive maintenance and inspection schedules."
