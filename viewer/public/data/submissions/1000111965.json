      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n1.1 Program Overview\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando has developed and is implementing a consolidated program to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- Title 40 CFR Part 68\u0097EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program\n- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\u0097OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management Program\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) program has fourteen (14) major program elements. The Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) risk management program (RMP) has the same major fourteen (14) program elements, but also has additional requirements for offsite consequence analyses and risk management plan submissions. Since the requirements in these two (2) regulations have substantial crossover, Cold-Link Logistics Orlando has elected to develop and implement one (1) consolidated program to meet the requirements of both regulations. This consolidated program is referred to as the RMP/PSM program. \n\n1.2 Cold-Link Logistics Orlando RMP/PSM Program Philosophy\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando is not developing, updating, and implementing the RMP/PSM program to simply \u0093check a box\u0094 or avoid regulatory penalties. Rather, Cold-Link Logistics Orlando is committed to promoting the overall safety and health of employees, contractors, and visitors onsite. Furthermore, Cold-Link Logistics Orlando has a duty to protect people and the environment in the surrounding community. Cold-Link Logistics Orlando management and employees understand that a properly developed and implemented RMP/PSM program will help avoid accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. While Cold-Link Logistics Orlando, works hard to deliver products to their customers, nothing takes precedence over maintaining the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando is a dry, cold, and freezer distribution center located i"

This ammonia refrigeration system is considered one (1) covered process having an ammonia inventory in excess of 10,000 lbs. Appendix A to Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 lists the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #: 7664-41-7) as 10,000 lbs. Since the quantity of the Ammonia Refrigeration System exceeds this quantity, it is subject to OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management standard found in Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.\nThe list of substances provided in Title 40 CFR \u00a768.130 also lists the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #: 7664-41-7) as 10,000 lbs. Since the quantity of the Ammonia Refrigeration System exceeds this quantity, it is subject to EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program standard found in Title 40 CFR Part 68.\nFinally, the Program Level of the covered process needed to be determined. Since the worst-case release scenario for the Ammonia Refrigeration System would affect public receptors, it is not eligible for Program 1. Further, since the Ammonia Refrigeration System is subject to Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 it is not eligible for Program 2. The result is that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nWhile Cold-Link Logistics Orlando has a thorough RMP/PSM policy, a description of the requirements associated with each program element are summarized in the sections below.\n\n3.1 Hazard Assessment\nCoordinate with a consultant to complete a Hazard Assessment initially, every five (5) years, and if a change necessitates it. Maintain Cold-Link Logistics Orlando\u0092s five-year accident history in the event that an incident meets the stringent criteria.\n\n3.2 Process Safety Information\t\nEnsure all elements of Process Safety Information are developed, accurate, in alignment with recognized and generally"

Make the SOPs accessible, keep them current, and certify them annually. Develop and implement safe work practices.\n\n3.5 Training\t\nEnsure all operators receive initial and refresher training at least every three (3) years on an overview of the process and the SOPs. Properly document training activities.\n\n3.6 Mechanical Integrity\nEnsure all equipment in the covered process is included in the Mechanical Integrity program. Establish or hire a consultant to establish written procedures. Ensure operators are trained for process maintenance activities. Ensure the procedures and frequency for inspections and testing align with RAGAGEP. Ensure inspections and tests are properly documented. Ensure equipment deficiencies which are outside acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner (when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation). In the construction of new plants and equipment, oversee quality assurance through checks and inspections and verifying proper materials of construction.\n\n3.7 Management of Change\t\nOversee the implementation of the Management of Change procedures for all changes except replacements in kind.\n\n3.8 Pre-Startup Safety Review\t\nOversee Pre-Startup Safety Review for new faciliti"

Ensure the RMP Submit is updated as necessary (e.g., within 6 months of an updated Hazard Assessment, PHA, or a change in program level). Submit a de-registration if Cold-Link Logistics Orlando is no longer subject. Ensure the RMP Submit is corrected as necessary (e.g., within 6 months of new five-year accident history information or within one month of a change in the emergency contact information).\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando has no five-year accident history.\n\n5.

Cold-Link Logistics Orlando will maintain a written record of each notification exercise conducted over the last five (5) years.\n\n5.4.2 Emergency Response Exercise Program\nSince Cold-Link Logistics Orlando is a non-responding stationary source, they need not develop an emergency response exercise program with field and tabletop exercises.\n\n5.4.3 Alternative Means of Meeting Exercise Requirements\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando may satisfy the requirement to conduct notification, field and/or tabletop exercises through: \n- Exercises conducted to meet other Federal, state or local exercise requirements, provided the exercise meets the requirements of the above bullet-point lists. \n- Response to an accidental release, provided the response includes the actions included in the bullet-point lists above, as appropriate. When used to meet field and/or tabletop exercise requirements, Cold-Link Logistics Orlando will prepare an after-action report comparable to the exercise evaluation report, within 90 days of the incident.\n\n5.5 Emergency Planning and Response\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando will establish and implement an emergency action plan for the entire plant in accordance with the provisions of Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nCold-Link Logistics Orlando strives for and embraces a culture of openness to change\u0097especially as it relates to safety. Rather than seeking methods apart from the RMP/PSM program, Cold-Link Logistics Orlando anticipates necessary changes becoming apparent as part of implementing the various elements and requirements of the process safety management and risk management program regulations.
