The Sudan Pump Station employs Chloramine disinfection which is the combination of Chlorine and Ammonia . Chlorine and Ammonia ( chloramines)  produce what is known as a combination residual. The process of using Chlorine and Ammonia  to form Chloramines enhance the longevity of the chlorine . Chloramines are used as the primary disinfectant to kill bacteria, algae and other microorganisms which are undersirable in public water supplies. \n                                        \n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n               Chlorine and Ammonia are present at the Sudan Pump Station . Chlorine and Ammoina are classified as toxic chemicals under the Environmental  Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program ( RMP) rule. Some of the same properties which make Chlorine and Ammonia valuable and necessary components of the Sudan Pump Station make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling each chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, Including the threat to plant personnel, neighboring citizens of Bailey County, as well the environment.\n\n                  It is the City of Lubbock policy to strictly adhere to all applicable FEDERAL and State Guidelines and Regulations. Safety depends on the manner in which Chlorine and Ammonia are handled at the station, the safety devices inherent in the design for the facility, the safe handling procedures which are in place and the training of  personnel.\n\n                  The City of Lubbock Fire Department will respond to any major release involving either Chlorine or Ammonia.
