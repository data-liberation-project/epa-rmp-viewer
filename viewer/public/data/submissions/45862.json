If an \naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \nauthorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the \nenvironment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen \nchloride is received and stored in a rail tank car that contains 149,000 pounds of refrigerated anhydrous \nhydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT containers such as tube \ntrailers and cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, and the  alternative release, or more probable, scenario were determined using the EPA?s Guidelines.  Endpoints were calculated using RMP*Comp ver 1.07 and affected populations were determined using ?Land View V? which is based on the 2000 US Census data.  \n\nThe Off site consequcence analysis and other related information may be reviewed  by contacting the facility.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release \nitself.
