The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and Joule-Thompson (J-T) effect . Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\nSection 112(r ) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Lott Ranch J-T Plant because the plant handles and stores methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities. Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1.?112(r )(1)- Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Regency is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Lott Ranch J-T Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Regency, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Wheeler Fire Department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Lott Ranch J-T Plant processes natural gas, recovering natural gas liquids. This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r )(1). Regency management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency responses in the event of a release. These programs are documented and described in this Risk Manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment Plan.\n\nFor planning purposes, Regency has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident, defined to be a complete release from the 12,000 gallon tank, resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which explodes. Because 74% of the stored liquids consist of hexane, heptane and octane which will not instantaneously form a vapor cloud, the volume of the flammable mixture utilized is that of only the regulated flammable chemicals. This volume was used in the provided RMP*Comp program to calculate a potential radius of impact of  0.20 miles. Global positioning system (GPS) locations were gathered on surrounding area residences that could conceivably fall into the worst case catastrophic event, and it was determined that there were none within the 0.20 mile radius. It should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the 0.20 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nRegency has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Regency has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures. Regency provides annual emergency response training to its employees. In addition, Regency has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Wheeler Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. The Lott Ranch J-T Plant is currently under construction and will be included in the facility's Emergency Response Plan before operation is initiated. Furthermore, all facility-specific training of employees will be completed before operation is initiated.\n\nRegency's management is committed to the following:\n-Preventing accidents;\n-Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accide"
