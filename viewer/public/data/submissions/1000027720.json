      "SummaryText": "\nThe facility is located in a modern industrial park adjacent to the Manchester, New Hampshire airport, and employs approximately 300 employees on three shifts. Normal operations are seven days per week, with twenty four hours aday manufacturing operations.The covered process at this facility is an ammonia-based mechanical refrigeration system which contains a maximum intended inventory of 18,500 pounds.The facility has a Process Safety Management Program. Operation of the ammonia equipment is restricted to only a select few trained, authorized operating/maintenance personnel, including outsourced service contractor personnel. The majority of the distribution piping which contains ammonia, and connects to air cooling evaporator units and process equipment, is located above the roof of the processing areas, and therefore not very susceptable to damage from accidental, inadvertant contact by lift trucks and lifted loads. Nearly all equipment within production spaces is located as high as possible within the spaces, to minimize accidents.Ammonia is an extremely hazardous and toxic chemical, but the toxicity level is substantial: the offensive, choking odor of ammonia is readily distinguished and familiar to most humans, who generally are intolerant of even low (<20 ppm) dosages. The toxicity concentration is 2400 ppm or above. The location of the facility in the community, together with the topography and consideration for prevailiing wind direction, helps to minimize the overall risk to human populations.An OSHA-prescribed Process Safety Management Program has been adopted for this facility. Under that Program, the major components of the process are inspected frequently. Operating conditions are constantly monitored by a computerized system with integral alarms that notify process operators of an upset. The readily distinguished odor of ammonia alerts persons in the constantly-inhabited areas where ammonia-containing piping and equipment is located that even the slig"

      "SummaryText": "htest release may have occurred. As stated above, the company has located principal piping and many key shutoff valves on the roof area for easier access in emergency conditions. Shutoff valves which allow operators to isolate sections of piping/equipment in compressor room areas are readily accessed. The compressor room area is well vented with high volume fans, and is readily accessible in case of a release in that area. As a testimony to the overall safety of the ammonia refrigeration system operation at this facility, and the diligence of the process operators, no accidents have occurred within the past five years which have necessitated an off-site evacuation or have had any offsite consequences.\nThe Londonderry Fire Department does not maintain its own HAZMAT Team, but does have a mutual aid agreement in place with nearby municipalities for the provision of those services in the event of an accidental release which requries external intervention or assistance. Stonyfield Farm will adopt the INTEGRATED CONTINGENCY PLAN format preferred by EPA and OSHA for preparing and implementing its onsite Emergency Action and Response Plan. Under this plan, emergency training and practice drills will be frequent and will cover a multitude of potential scenarios.Trained Incident Commanders (Shift managers) will become involved immediately upon the recognition and characterization of all non-incidental ammonia releases, and their duties will be as follows: (a) on-site coordination for safety and secruity of all employees, contractors and visitors; (b) timely notification of local, state and federal agencies; c) and communication with the public as necessary. Stonyfield Farm will continue to investigate and implement changes to the ammonia process in order to improve safety and minimize risks associated with it. In addition to relocating piping and valves, future plans include the increase of automatic ammonia leak detection systems, improved access to safety shutoffs, and sys"
