      "SummaryText": "About our Facility:\n\n     The South Plant Facility is located in rural Columbia County, about six miles\n\nsouth of Magnolia, Arkansas.  Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\n\nagricultural, with silviculture predominating.  The plant is located astride a low hill or\n\nridge east of Horsehead Creek. \n\n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\n\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\n\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\n\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \n\n     The South Plant produces bromine, sulfur, fire retardants, pesticides and\n\npesticide intermediates, clear completion fluids and other speciality chemicals.  \n\n\n\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n     The South Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\n\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the South Plant Facility to reduce the\n\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\n\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\n\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\n\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \n\n     The Policy of the South Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\n\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\n\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\n\nwhich follows EPA's \"One Plan\" concept.  South Plant personnel respond to\n\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\n\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\n\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\n\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \n\n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appear"

If a situation has impact beyond the\n\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\n\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\n\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\n\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\n\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency\n\nplans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical\n\ndifferences in the facilities.\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled at the South Plant:\n\n     The South Plant is known to handle as many as fifteen listed chemicals in up to\n\n21 processes.  Information on the handling and storage was gathered.  Approximately eleven\n\nregulated chemicals in eight processes were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The\n\naccidental release prevention and emergency response programs are exactly the same\n\nfor covered and non-covered processes; covered and non-covered chemicals are both\n\nsubject to both programs.

The PHA identifies any and all possible mishaps, the likelihood and\n\nconsequences of mishaps, and predicts how safety and mitigation systems will perform\n\nin the event of a mishap.  For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the\n\nrequisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial\n\nhygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be\n\nused to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied\n\nto a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the\n\nprocess.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate\n\nthose hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\n\n     Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started\n\nup, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in\n\nSOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures,\n\noperation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process\n\nhazards.
