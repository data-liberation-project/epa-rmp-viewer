This facility has essentially two business units; one half of the plant is a large Cold Storage and Distribution facility, the other half is a Food Processing facility. The common refrigeration system has capabilities to provide three different temperature ranges within the plant. The smallest portion of the of the refrigeration load is to maintain + 40\u00baF to +50\u00baF refrigeration for plant processing water, air conditioning and loading dock temperature control. The second largest refrigeration load operates at -20\u00baF for a large Cold Stores and a smaller holding freezer. The last and largest portion of the refrigeration load is to produce and maintain -45\u00baF (processing \u00bfblast\u00bf freezers).\n\nThe facility\u00bfs refrigeration system was engineered and designed to meet or exceed current industry Standards and regulations. \n\nThe refrigeration system uses industry Standard materials, components, and follows the IIAR and refrigeration industry guidelines which actually provide overlapping layers of safety and protection of the refrigeration system and its components. These overlapping layers of protection are provided through the use of automatic and manual controls which minimize operating deviation and maintain the system within safe operational parameters. In the most critical operations, there are also redundant back-up systems to these overlapping control systems.\n\nAlong with the inherent sound engineering and design that was originally built into the system, Trident Seafoods has taken a very pro-active approach to all aspects of safety, especially our approach to chemical safety as it pertains to ammonia. We have provided extensive training for all employees working onsite as to the hazards involved with ammonia and other onsite chemical substances.  We have conducted several mock evacuation drills to expose and train all employees of their roles and responsibilities should an emergency arise. \n\nAs for the use of other chemicals involved in th"

The pier property covers greater than 152 acres and Trident\u00bfs facility is located almost exactly in the middle; covering nearly 168,000 square feet. Fortunately, with respect to exposure, this central property location gives the facility, which freezes seafood products using ammonia, a fairly large spatial (area) buffer to the North, East and West. Directly to the south is another Cold Storage that also uses ammonia as a refrigerant. These central property locations help mitigate potential exposure to residential areas adjacent to the pier properties.\n\nTrident Seafoods Corporate and Management Staff are committed to the Health and Safety of our employees, surrounding communities and the environment. Our facility managers are equally committed to these same safety and health values. \n\nWe have designed and implemented a complete and comprehensive facility Safety Plan with supporting Policies. \n\nBecause our facility now has on the premises anhydrous ammonia in excess of 10,000 pounds we have completed and administered the PSM Program working closely with the Washington Industrial and Health Administration (WISHA) Consultation and Training.  Herein we submit to the EPA this application for RMP Plan approval.\n\nThe facility utilizes this refrigeration system to freeze and store seafood as well as various other food products. The total quantity of ammonia contained in the system mandates compliance with the OSHA\\WISHA Process Safety Management Program and the EPA Level 3 Risk Management Program. These programs are designed to assure the health and safety of all onsite employees, as well as offsite public and environmental receptors. \n\nThe Pier-91 facility utilizes a common refrigeration system to produce refrigeration for several distinct and separate processes, sometimes at"

All aspects of our general plant safety programs, procedures and policies comply with the latest WISHA Standards as determined by recent inspections. \n\nThe PSM Program was written following OSHA guidelines and implemented interactively with WISHA Consultation and Training. The refrigeration system design complies fully with the ASHRE and ANSI Standards.\n\nThe ammonia piping system is completely labeled and marked in accordance with OSHA recommendations and follows IIAR Best Practices. It is our policy at this facility to conduct and document monthly safety meetings. As well, there are specific and designated employee operators required each year to attend refresher training relating to safe ammonia systems operation.\n\nThere have been no onsite or off-site ammonia related incidents resulting in any injury, death, property or environmental damage during the 5-year accident history period required to complete this Risk Management Plan submittal. \n\nWe have put considerable effort into designing a comprehensive Emergency Response Program. The PSM Plan has been fully implemented at the facility with direct input and appropriate training to include all facility department staff. \nWe have also worked closely with local emergency responders on how to mitigate and further reduce potential exposures to our employees and surrounding community and environment.\n\nWe have always strived to make improvements in our process and operational systems.

Completion of this project will help further mitigate exposure to surrounding properties.\n\nWe will continue to make every effort to fully comply with the Risk Management Plan, the PSM Program, and to do our utmost best to operate this facility safely and responsibly.\n\nPlease contact me at (206) 272-3921 if you have any questions.\n\n\n\nMichael J.
