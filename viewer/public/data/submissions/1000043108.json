The process is located at 3116 East Pennsylvania Ave., Tucson, Arizona 85714.  The chlorine system at Pool Chlor of Tucson consists of chlorine one-ton containers (the primary storage vessels), a filling manifold with valves, and a scrubber / neutralization tank.  Chlorine gas is drawn from the ton container to 20-pound cylinders.  The following is a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\n\n\nChlorine Tanks (one-ton containers)\n\n(7 - Maximum that can be stored) Located at the south end of the facility.\n\n\n\nChlorine Tanks (20-pound containers)\n\n(80 - Maximum that can be stored): Located in a locked cage.\n\n\n\nFilling Manifold: Located at the south end of the facility.\n\n\n\nScrubber System: Located at the south end of the facility.\n\n\n\nChlorine Sensor: Located at the south end of the facility near the fill station.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 14,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nPool Chlor of Tucson has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handl"

In the event of an accidental release of chlorine, Pool Chlor will call 911 in order to reach the Tucson Rural Metro Fire Department / HAZMAT team.  Pool Chlor of Tucson has a B-kit available at the facility for use by emergency responders in mitigating a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nPool Chlor of Tucson has revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (March 2014) which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pool Chlor facility.
