There are a total of four screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. All four compressors operate on both a -20?F recirculator package and a +20? package. The C-2 compressor has a side ports to maintain a +20?F high side trap.  \n\nThere are two separate suction temperatures a -25?F low temp. Recirculator to maintain freezer rooms and a +20?F high side trap. The high side trap maintains dock temperatures and convertible rooms at +30? or above.\n\nThere is one rooftop mounted evaporative condensers with remote sumps.  There is also one, glycol shell and tube units use for under floor heating.  \nProcess Description\n\nLiquid Side\n\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the Condensers.  The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves Condenser units EC-1 via a 3? inch pipe and flows to the High Pressure Receiver (V-1).  \n\n \n\nThe high-pressure liquid also leaves High Pressure receiver via a 2\" line and feeds both high and low temp recirculator packages V-2 and V-3. It also supplies liquid to the compressors for liquid injection oil cooling C-1 through C-4.\n\n   \n\nThe Low and High Temperature Recirculators are operated at -25?F and +20?F.  A float and solenoid device controls the liquid supply to V-2 and \nV-3.  The liquid from the Low and High Temperature Recirculators is pumped to the evaporator units in the plant.\n\n\n \nVapor Side\n\nThe Compressors remove the vapors from both the High Temperature Recirculator and the Low Temperature Recirculator vessels.  \n\nScrew compressors: C-1 through C-4 remove the vapors from the High Temperature trap through side ports and direct to suction line depending on load.  Screw Compressor C-1  through C-4 removes vapors from the Lo"

The Condensers change superheated vapor discharged from the Compressors and remove a sufficient amount of heat such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  \n\n \n \nAdditionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium.  This defrost gas is sent to the Air Units   for removal of ice that has built up on the coils.\n\n\n \nDefinitions\n\n \n\n\nSingle Stage Compression System\n\nA single stage compressor system utilizes one or more compressors to pump the refrigerant vapor from the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side of the refrigeration system.  Each compressor discharges directly to the condenser units via a common header. \n\n\nRecirculator System\n\nA recirculator system is a combination of a vessel, pumps, valves and other components used to feed a refrigeration circuit.  The cycle center system supplies liquid to the various evaporators.  The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor.\n"
