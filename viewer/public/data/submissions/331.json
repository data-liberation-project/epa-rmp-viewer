The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field \nverification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accident Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented. See also Section II, Part I of the PSM Manual\n\n8.\tMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified, (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  \n\nProcedures are in place to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

      "SummaryText": "ified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Custer Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.   Mechanical integrity procedures are also covered in Section II, Part J of the PSM Manual.\n\n9.\tSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \n\n\nSee also Section II, Part K Hot Work Permit  of the PSM Manual.\n\n10.\tManagement of Change\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n7 The maximum quantity stored would be 280,160 pounds in our two-11,000 gallon storage tanks, our one-12,000 gallon storage tank, and our one-30,000 gallon storage tank.  \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.41 miles.\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.

A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is from the NGL storage tank (i.e. product surge tank) with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.40 miles.  This is based on using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations found in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance dated May 24, 1996.   The storage capacity of the largest (& only) NGL storage tank is 40,000 gallons, which is limited to 80% or 32,000 gallons by administrative controls.  It assumes the entire contents of the tank (32,000 gallons or 119,607 pounds) is released instantaneously and is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\n 2.\tAlternative Releases\n\nAlternative releases scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.

The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called residue gas) is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.\n\nThe Custer Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \n\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Custer Gas Plant, are NGL's (product), methane and condensate.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.
