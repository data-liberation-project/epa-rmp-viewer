      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE\r\nPROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety.  This\r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\r\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\r\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\r\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant, located in rural Hemphill County, Texas, 2 miles east of Highway 83 on FM 277 operates a cryogenic natural gas liquids extraction process and other processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane) from field gas.  The gas plant also recovers the regulated flammables, propane and ethane.  There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. As such, the Hobart (277) Cyrogenic plant is a Program 3 RMP facility.\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cyrogenic plant is primarily an NGL, condensate, and sales gas production facility.  The inlet gas stream enters the plant through pipelines(s) and flows through liquids separation equipment, which separates separable inlet condensate and produced/slop water from the gas.  The separated gas stream is compressed by gas-fired IC engine-driven gas compressors and enters the glycol gas dehydration unit.  The dehydrated gas flows through the cryogenic NGL recovery unit, which significantly lowers the temperature and pressure of the gas, as well as removes energy from the gas, enabling lighter (primarily propane and ethane) NGL to be separated from the gas.  The separated NGL is stored in one (1) 30,000-gallon pressurized tank and exits the site through pipeline. The residue gas stream from the cryogenic"

Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM)\r\nstandard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the\r\nmanagement system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety\r\nmanagement and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating\r\nand compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a\r\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of\r\nthe gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the\r\naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is\r\nmaintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In\r\naddition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and\r\nemployee safety issues.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\r\noperation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated\r\nhazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment\r\ndesign basis/configuration information.  Specific departments are assigned responsibility for\r\nmaintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The referen"

This information is\r\nsupplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known\r\nhazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas\r\nplant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,\r\nlevel, composition).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\r\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\r\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design\r\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a\r\nbasis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed\r\nchanges to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\r\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\r\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\r\nmanage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five\r\nyears and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results\r\nand findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are\r\nforwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is\r\ndocumented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process\r\noperations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4)\r\nemergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These\r\nprocedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent\r\ntraining of new operators.

Chemical hazard information, process operating\r\nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these\r\nchanges.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training\r\non the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\r\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. \r\nThe goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent\r\na recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings,\r\ndevelops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant\r\nmanagement for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's\r\nfindings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding\r\nor recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees\r\n(including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are\r\nretained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA\r\nrevalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Hobart (277) Cryogenic\r\nplant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required\r\nby the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at\r\nleast every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \r\nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.

      "SummaryText": "Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant has\r\nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a\r\nprocess.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already\r\nfamiliar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is\r\npaired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators\r\ndemonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the\r\nduties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all\r\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their\r\nskills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\r\nat least every three years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means\r\nused to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\r\nmaintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process\r\nequipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work\r\nin a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in\r\ntheir workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand\r\nand follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find\r\nduring their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,\r\n(2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and\r\n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant\r\nevaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the"

Gas\r\nplant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are\r\nfulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that\r\nrequires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that\r\nsafety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior\r\nto placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure\r\nconstruction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are\r\noperationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR\r\ninvolves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by\r\nrequiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Hobart (277) Cryogenic Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure\r\nvessels, piping systems, relief valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency\r\nshutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
