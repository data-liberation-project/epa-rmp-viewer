Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Andersons Sioux City facility are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such an unforeseeable release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Emergency Services in Sioux City along with Woodbury Emergency Management Services which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Production of liquid fertilizer 10-34-0, 6-24-6 and 9-18-9.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia, which has two production purposes.  Ammonia is (1) used to control pH of certain liquid fertilizers and is also used (2) to react with phosphoric acid and other raw materials to produce various grades of liquid starter fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is 128,265 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the relea"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP review. These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Andersons Sioux City maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Operating instructions are recertified yearly.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Andersons Sioux City has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.  Operators in the fertilizer unit are certified.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Andersons Sioux City carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  M"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Much of the information about the maintenance performed at the plant is stored on the MAPCON maintenance system.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Andersons Sioux City to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.  Contractor personnel affected by the changes are also made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Andersons Sioux City.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Andersons Sioux City conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Andersons Sioux City promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEm"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Andersons Sioux City has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Andersons Sioux City has a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, no RMP reportable ammonia releases have occurred in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Andersons Sioux City is a non-responding facility with respect to the RMP chemical onsite.  It has a written emergency action plan which addresses the required information for non-responding facilities. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nWoodbury County Emergency Services is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.  \n\nIn addition, the EPA has conducted a chemical safety audit of this facility.\n\n\n\n6.
