In this way we promote \r\noverall plant, worker, and public safety.\r\n\r\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the \r\nconsequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and \r\nother types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental \r\nfatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including \r\nany use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or \r\ncombination of these activities.  Any group of vessels that are interconnected and \r\nseparate vessels, which are located, such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a \r\npotential release shall be considered a single process.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and \r\npractices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These \r\nrules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and \r\naccepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nSuperior Ethanol operates a 50 million gallon per year ethanol \r\nproduction facility in Superior, IA.  The only chemical found to be present above its \r\nrespective RMP quantity threshold at this facility is aqueous ammonia.

The RMP Manager has the overall \r\nRMP responsibility, and has the authority to assign company resources to develop, \r\nimplement, update, and integrate all applicable RMP elements at Superior Ethanol. \r\nThe RMP/PSM Team Leader is assigned by the RMP Manager to ensure that the RMP is \r\ndeveloped, implemented, and updated in compliance with the RMP regulations.

The RMP/PSM Team Leader \r\nis supported by the RMP/PSM Team, which includes the Maintenance Manager, \r\nProduction Manager, EHSS Coordinator, and other employees as necessary.  Individuals\r\n have been assigned responsibility for all five elements of the RMP, including management,\r\n prevention, hazard assessment, emergency response, and RMP updates.  In addition, the RMP/PSM \r\nteam is responsible to communicate the requirements of the RMP to the members of the \r\nemergency response team (ERT), who have been trained to provide the initial site \r\nresponse/incident command for hazardous material releases, fires or explosions. \r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM Team Leader reports to the RMP Manager and receives direction and \r\nsupport from the rest of the company's Management team.

Updating the OSHA program is a continuous process and \r\nseveral of the OSHA program element guidelines and procedures are currently being \r\nupdated, and will be completed shortly after the RMP submittal due date.  Key provisions \r\nof the facility release prevention program are as follows:\r\n\r\n Employees who operate these systems must receive training initially and periodically on \r\nsafe startup/shutdown, operations, and emergency shutdown of the processes.  \r\n Release incidents are investigated, and the results are used to improve the safety of the \r\nprocess. \r\n The ammonia system is maintained through the mechanical integrity \r\nprogram, which minimizes the risk of accident and maximizes process safety. \r\n Results of incident investigations are also shared with employees who could be affected \r\nby the process.  \r\n Employees participated in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identified potential \r\nhazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or whenever \r\nsignificant changes are made to the process.\r\n The facility has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates that \r\nchanges to the ammonia system are reviewed prior to implementing the change to ensure \r\nthat the change would not compromise safety.\r\n A pre-startup review is also completed after a major change and prior to a new process \r\ncoming on line.  \r\n A hot work (spark producing) permit program is in place. \r\n Contractors who are hired to work on or near the regulated processes must have adequate \r\ntraining on the hazards prior to starting work.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nOffsite consequence analyses need to consider the release history of each process.

However, EPA guidance was followed and toxic \r\nendpoints were identified for the WCS and the ACS.  ACSs are considered by EPA to be \r\nmore realistic and useful for emergency response planning than the WCS.\r\n\r\nFollowing EPA guidance the largest vessel approach, considering potential passive \r\nmitigation, was used to estimate the WCS.  The WCS for the facility was identified by \r\nassuming that the contents of the largest vessel are released in a 10-minute period. The \r\nlargest vessel in the ammonia system is located in the main process building inside a diked containment area.\r\n  This vessel contains a maximum of 28000 gallons of 30% ammonia in water solution.  \r\nUnder worst case weather conditions, the modeled WCS \r\nrelease would result in an endpoint radius of 0.2 miles.
