They are the Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit (including on-site storage and drumming), where Anhydrous Ammonia and Ammonia Solution > 19% are used and the Bleach Production Unit, where bleach is manufactured using chlorine. \r\n\r\nProcess 1 and 2 - The Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit produces 29% Ammonium Hydroxide by mixing Anhydrous Ammonia with de-ionized water.  This process also includes on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide in tanker trucks while awaiting shipment off site or  drumming on-site (Process 2).\r\n\r\nProcess 2 - In the drumming operation, ammonium hydroxide manufactured in Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit is drummed for shipment offsite. Ammonia is transferred to the drumming operation from the Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit by tank trucks.  Ammonia is offloaded from the tank truck into drums or totes using an automated drumming machine.  While this process can be classified as Program Level 2 Borden & Remington Manages this process at level 3. \r\n\r\nProcess 3 - 15% Bleach is manufactured by mixing chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and water in a specially designed reactor.  After the bleach is manufactured is it stored in bulk for shipment off-site and/or is drummed for shipment. \r\n\r\nProcess 4 -Rail cars containing anhydrous ammonia and chlorine are received in the railyard.

In the event of an incident or near miss, a team is assembled to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the root cause of any incident involving a release of a chemical and or a deviation of a production unit from its design intent. \r\n\r\nOnce the root cause is established, recommendations addressing the root cause are proposed by the investigating team.

      "SummaryText": "mation been compiled for each chemical?\r\n\r\nYes. Borden & Remington has assembled process safety information required by 40 CFR 68.65 for each of the RMP processes. Process safety information includes offsite consequence analyses which consider theoretical worst case and alternative case chemical release migrations. Process safety information was utilized by the different Process Safety Teams to conduct process hazard analyses. The process safety information is reviewed on an annual basis and updated if the information changes.\r\n\r\n Have Process Hazard Analyses been completed and subsequent recommendations developed? \r\n\r\nYes. Borden & Remington has completed comprehensive Process Hazard Analyses for each RMP process on site. Piping and instrument diagrams and other process safety information were used to identify deviations from design intention. Consequence, cause and existing safeguards and their corresponding level of risk were considered when developing recommendations to reduce risk. Recommendations continue to be implemented as action items, as detailed in hard copies of the PHAs that are maintained on site in the RMP binder.\r\n\r\nHave operating procedures been developed/updated for processes utilizing the listed chemicals?\r\n\r\nYes. Borden & Remington has developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for processes performed by its employees. The company is ISO 9000 certified and, as such, has a management system in place to maintain its standard operating procedures. \r\nThe SOPs for PSM and RMP listed chemicals were updated in 2014 to include safety information and warnings at crucial steps within the process. Crucial steps are those that were identified during the process hazard analyses as intrinsically risky. If possible, crucial steps have been modified or eliminated. The updated SOPs work to reduce risk through modified standardized methodologies.\r\n\r\nHave there been any reportable incidents within the last 5 years involving any RMP listed chemicals?\r\n\r\nNo."

      "SummaryText": "Do employees receive adequate training in the SOPs for RMP regulated chemicals?\r\n\r\nYes. Borden & Remington has a training program that ensures each employee is given refresher training every 3 years (or more frequently if observations of employee practices indicate the need for refresher training).  During training, employees review operating procedures and other safety information related to the processes involving RMP chemicals.\r\n\r\nDoes Borden & Remington have a Preventative Maintenance Program in place that will ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment used in the RMP regulated production units?\r\n\r\nYes. The Preventative Maintenance Program in place at Borden & Remington requires daily, weekly and monthly inspection of production units that use RMP-listed chemicals.  These inspections are performed by the operators and if a deficiency is noted during the inspection it is either corrected by the operator or the operator informs the maintenance manager, who initiates repair and/or correction of the deficiency. \r\n\r\nIn addition to formal inspections that are documented on inspection forms, cursory visual inspections are performed daily by operating personnel as they perform their normal work duties. \r\n\r\nAll storage tanks, reactors and piping comply with API and ASME standards. Vessels and piping are tested periodically as recommend by the manufacturer. Additionally, per Massachusetts Department of Fire Service regulations, ASTs greater than 10,000 gallons storing fluids other than water must undergo annual inspections by a certified 3rd party inspector.\r\n\r\nDoes the Company have in place procedures that ensure changes in process and new processes are managed safely?\r\n\r\nYes. Management of Change and New Process Review is achieved through Borden & Remington's ISO 9001 Management Program. A system exists where technical and administrative approvals are required before a process change or new process is initiated.\r\n\r\nDoes the Company audit compliance with the its R"

Borden & Remington has designated certain areas in which welding and other work involving ignition sources (Hotwork) may be performed. Any hotwork necessary outside of the designated areas must be conducted in conformance with the policies and procedures of Borden & Remington's Hotwork Program. \r\n\r\nThe Hotwork Program requires a permit to be issued before the hot work can be conducted. The permit is used as a control mechanism to ensure that the employee(s) performing the hotwork have the right equipment, knowledge and procedures in place to perform their job safely.\r\n\r\nDoes Borden & Remington have controls in place to ensure that contractors entering upon the site and or work on RMP regulated production unit are sufficiently trained as to the hazards of the production units?\r\n\r\nYes. Borden & Remington restricts access to the regulated production units. Authorization for access is given only after the hazards and emergency procedures are conveyed to the contractor. Prior to entry, the contractor is required to sign an affidavit stipulating their awareness of the hazards and procedures. Production unit access points are posted with warning signs indicating areas that hazardous chemicals are used and that only authorized personnel may enter. Where applicable, Borden and Remington may review the safety records and safety programs of contractors working in areas of the facility where RMP chemicals are used.\r\n\r\nWhat steps is Borden & Remington taking to minimize the risk at its facility?   \r\n\r\nBorden & Remington recently installed a new scrubber to replace an outdated scrubber where chlorine railcars are unloade"

      "SummaryText": "d.  The scrubber would be used in emergency situations if there were a release of chlorine gas from the railcar.\r\n\r\nBorden and  Remington has also spent time since the most recent compliance audit (December 2102) revising the RMP manual in a manner that presents the RMP information clearly and more concisely, allowing Borden and Remington to better manage their RMP.\r\n\r\nAdditional updates to the RMP manual have been made and several facility upgrades were also made, including, but not limited to: an inspection of piping by a 3rd party contractor to ensure its integrity, construction of secondary containment dikes in the bleach production unit, sanding and repainting of piping, piping supports, tanks and electrical components. In addition, a new process was included in the RMP that covers receiving, storage and handling of railcars in the railyard.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Borden & Remington has embraced the RMP and integrated it into the culture of the Company. It is this mindset that will result in the continued diligence towards the maintenance and improvement of the Company's Risk Management Program and subsequent lower risk to the environment and the community. As time passes the components of the RMP, will become stronger and more effective as they are reviewed and revised. It is Borden & Remington's commitment to facilitating the evolution of an ever-improving RMP that is the catalyst that will result in the significant and permanent reduction of risk."
