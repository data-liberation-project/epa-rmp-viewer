      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility\nAt the Auburn Water Filter Plant, we handle chlorine, which EPA considers hazardous. Certain safety precautions must be followed in order to allow for a safe work environment, preventing unnecessary exposure, and reducing threat to members of the community. The City adheres to all state and federal rules and regulations that are applicable to this facility. A safe environment at the plant is dependent on the manner in which chlorine is handled, the safety devices included in the facility, safe handling procedures and ongoing safety training of filter plant personnel.\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled\nThe Auburn Water Filter Plant is located at the corner of Swift Street and Pulsifer Drive in the City of Auburn. The slow-sand filtration plant was constructed in 1919. The City presently has two filtration plants in use: a slow-sand plant and a rapid-sand plant. The plant contains four beds with a total capacity of about 8 mgd. The water level is generally about 7 feet in the beds. The beds consist of about 3 feet of sand supported by 12 inches of gravel. Prior to rapid sand filtration, the raw water passes through an upflow clarifier for suspended solids removal. Powdered alum is the primary coagulant and is fed via solution form to a mixing basin in the center of the clarifier. The alum dose is controlled manually by the plant operators based on the raw water flow and characteristics. The sludge accumulated at the bottom of the clarifier is drained to a lagoon where the supernatant is decanted to the Owasco Lake outlet. Sludge is removed from the bottom of the lagoon on an as needed basis.\n\nDisinfection is accomplished by a vacuum gas chlorination system. Chlorine can be injected at the plant influent and filter effluent (prior to the clearwell). The chlorine residual of the water prior to entering the distribution system is measured by an online chlorine residual analyze"

      "SummaryText": "r. The chlorine feed rate is manually adjusted to maintain a free chlorine residual of approximately 1.5 mg/l entering the distribution system. The City has the capability to feed sodium hypochlorite in the event that the gas chlorinators become inoperable.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at this facility is 6,000 lbs. (3 Ton cylinders).\n\nThe worse-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\n\u00b7Worse-case scenario. A gas release would release 2,000 lbs. of chlorine. The distance to the endpoint is 1.30 miles.\n\u00b7Alternative scenario. A pipe leak liberating chlorine gas. The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario is 1.30 miles. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\nThe City of Auburn Water Filter Plant complies New York State codes and regulations that are applicable. Design and construction of the facility was in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the New York State Health Department, which inspects annually. The City has in place a Water Supply Emergency Action Plan, which includes a section on \u00bfChlorine Gas Leak Emergency Procedure.\u00bf The Auburn Fire Department also has in place a policy entitled \u00bfHazardous Materials Response Plan.\u00bf\n \nThe five-year accident history\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program\nThe Water Filter Plant has an emergency response program in place entitled \u00bfWater Supply Emergency Plan.\u00bf Also, the Auburn Fire Department has in place a policy entitled \u00bfHazardous Materials Response Plan,\u00bf created in conjunction with the Public Works Department and the Water Filter Plant, specifically to deal with chlorine emergencies.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nA liquid sodium hypochlorite system has been installed in spring 2004 and pending engineering trials, will go online late fall/early summer 2004. As a result, the gas system will be taken offline and removed."
