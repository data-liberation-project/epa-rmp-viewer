      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the LaRoche - Cherokee Plant\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries - Cherokee Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nWe also have a thorough emergency response plan in place in which our employees and local responders are familiar with through periodic training.  Should a release occur that requires emergency response, the Colbert County LEPC and the Cherokee Voluntary Fire Department stand ready to work with us to implement this plan and provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the Manufacture of Ammonia and related processes e.g., Nitric Acid, manufacture of Ammonia Nitrate.  Our facility is set up to manufacture Urea; however, that process has not been active since February 1, 1998 and we do not anticipate when that process will return to active status.  Since the Urea Process is in a \"mothball\" state and could restart, we have included the data with this submittal. LaRoche does not anticipate when this process will be restarted.\n\nWe have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous), Ammonia (aqueous) and Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)].  Ammonia (anhydrous) is manufactured by our facility and is used to manufacture Nitric Acid (< 80 percent).  Ammonia (aqueous) is used for the manufacture of Urea and the manufacture of Ammonia nitrate solutions.  Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)] is used "

(12,625.6 tons) while Ammonia (aqueous) and Nitric oxide  [Nitrogen oxide (NO)] are present at our facility in quantities of 74,206 lb. (37 tons) and 828 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Letdown Area - Anhydrous Ammonia: Distribution and Storage Process.  In this scenario 14,000,000 lb. (7,000 tons) of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Letdown Area - Anhydrous Ammonia: Distribution and Storage Process.  The scenario involves the release of 4,250 lb. (2.125 tons) of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.62 miles (3,274 feet).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from t"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) is 0.31 miles (1,637 feet).\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Letdown and Ammonia Solutions processes for the plant were designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, Section 8 1955 edition.  The Urea Manufacturing process was designed and constructed using ASME Section 8, 1979 edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source for the Program 3 processes: 1) the Letdown Area - Anhydrous Ammonia: Distribution and Storage Process, 2) the High Pressure Ammonia Ammonium-Nitrate Solutions Unit: Manufacturing Process, and 3) the Urea Unit: Manufacturing Process.\n\nIt is important to note that the Urea Unit: Manufacturing Process has been inactive since February 1, 1998 and LaRoche does not anticipate when the process will be restarted.  The data and information for the Urea Unit: Manufacturing Process has been included with this submittal due to the process's \"mothball\" state.  If and when the Urea Unit: Manufacturing Process becomes active, we will re-submit the RMP with updated information.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLaRoche Industries maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nP"

      "SummaryText": "rocess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/18/1996.  The PHA for the Urea Unit: Manufacturing Process will be revalidated prior to its restart.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LaRoche Industries maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLaRoche Industries has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLaRoche Industries carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 11/05/1997.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews (PSSR) related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LaRoche Industries.  None of the covered processes have conducted a PSSR because the processes have not been significantly modified since design and construction.  Any PSSR reviews conducted by the plant would confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLaRoche Industries conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 05/29/1998.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLaRoche Industries promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLaRoche Industries truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  LaRoche Industries has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nLaRoche Industries has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.  In the last five years, there were no accidents occurring at out plant meeting the RMP criteria.  According to the RMP rule, an accidental release is defined as a release from the covered process that resulted in death, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place, or environmental damage.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nLaRoche Industries carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
