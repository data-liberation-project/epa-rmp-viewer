CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with EAST POINT FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous),  and Hydrofluoric Acid. The Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid,  and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide,  and Hydrofluoric Acid  are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 57,750 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous),  and Hydrofluoric Acid are present at our facility in quantities of 16,750 lbs.  and 5,580 lbs. respectively.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as SAFER/TRACE. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe "

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.60 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a 150 lb. CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.70 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 150 lb. SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.90 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrofluoric Acid involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3262 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid  in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 6.7 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.44 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/l.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
