Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nChem Tech's Policy is to fully comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. This\n\nincludes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe Risk Management Plan along with other safety and environmental programs already in-place\n\nenables Chem Tech to prevent the occurrence of fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents associated with AB-80 storage and transfer. The emergency response plan is designed to minimize AB-80 releases and potential for explosion or fire through prompt mitigation actions and immediate notification of local fire department and outside emergency responders.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChem Tech located in Bristol, Indiana produces adhesives for the Recreational Vehicle (RV) industry.  In producing these materials, AB-80 (a propane and butane mixture) is used as a solvent propellant in the adhesive products.  AB-80 is stored as a liquified gas in a horizontal pressure vessel at the rear of the facility property and is dispensed into cylinders that are used for propellant filling of product containers in production operations. \n\n\n\nThe components of AB-80 (propane and butane) are flammable substances listed in the Part 68 rule.  The AB-80 is stored in a quantity that exceeds its threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds under both the EPA RMP rule and the OSHA PSM standard.  Thus, the propellant storage and filling system is subject to both rules and the requirement for having RMP and PSM Programs. As such, AB-80 meets the criteria for a Program 3 process as specified in the RMP rules.\n\n\n\n3. Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nChem Tech complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules for AB-80 propellant. All elements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented.\n\n\n\nThe AB-80 storage tank was design"

      "SummaryText": "ed and constructed per industry standards for pressure vessels and following good engineering practices. The initial PHA was conducted from July 11-12, 2018 using the What-If analysis technique and checklists were used to ensure thorough coverage of human factors and stationary source facility siting.  Additionally, unique site-specific issues were evaluated to ensure that all potential hazards of the AB-80 propellant storage and filling station system at Chem Tech were thoroughly reviewed.  \n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures for AB-80 delivery, storage, handling, and transfer are in place. All\n\npersons working with AB-80 equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures. A preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing program is in place for AB-80 equipment and operations.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nNo accidents involving AB-80 have occurred in the last five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nChem Tech has trained employees for emergency response and maintains a written emergency response plan. The plan is coordinated with Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Bristol Volunteer Fire Department. The emergency response plan includes procedures for stopping/mitigating release of the AB-80, if deemed safe to do so, and immediate notification of local fire department and outside emergency response personnel. Local emergency responders and fire personnel have copies of the emergency response plan and are familiar with its use. Local responders visit the site annually to review the AB-80 tank and process and related fire protection and prevention systems.\n\n"
