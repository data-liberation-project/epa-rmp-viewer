GRAINCO FS Inc.'s address was 2510 W. Grand Ridge Road, Mazon, IL 60444 and Access Ag, Inc.'s address was 2490 W. Grand Ridge Road, Mazon, IL 60444. The two facilities are next door to each other and we are now utilizing both facilities as one facility with the address of 2490 W. Grand Ridge Road, Mazon, Illinois 60444.This RMP plan contains the increased inventory of the combined facilities. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 1,335,479 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks. The storage and handling system consists of 2-12,000, 1-28,000, and 1-30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop productionnutrient.  \n\nThe management and employees of GRAINCO FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mazon Fire Department, Grundy County Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Ruls and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has imnplementedcx the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occup"

Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident prevention program.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; not\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has:\n-a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n-provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Titls III (EPCRA).  In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Mazon Fire Department and Grundy County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Daily visual evaluations are performed on operations and maintenance to asses safe condidtions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nCompleted project on 11/20/2009 we removed all permanent storage tanks from this site. The nurse tanks will remain on site totaling 813,134 pounds of ammonia (101 qty 1,000 gallon tanks, 24 qty 1,450 gallons, 2 qty 1,850 gallons, and 7 qty 2,000 gallon tanks.\n\nBulk storage bottles of 26,000 gal and 30,000 were added 9/27/2010."
