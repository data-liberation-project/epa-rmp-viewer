      "SummaryText": "The Randall Farmers Coop Union Executive Summary-Randall Branch\n\nPrepared By: Archie Thompson\n\n\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nOur employees will do what is possible with their training to stop the release, but will not be emergency responders. The Randall Farmers Coop Union fire department will be the emergency responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee will be used for major evacuations.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe NH3 facility is located directly east of the city limits. Randall receives storage and distributes Anhydrous Ammonia to farmers as agricultural nutrient.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorst case scenario would release 79,000 pounds in 10 minute period or 7,900 pounds per minute with a .94 mile to end point. Alternative release could involve a transfer hose rupture. This would result in a release of 11,908 pounds in a 2 minute period with a .56 mile to end point.\n\n\n\n4.Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe Randall Farmers Coop Union recognizes all safety regulations and procedures required by State and Federal Agencies and has annual training for employees. the most common accidental release would be the overfilling of nurse trailers; An example would be a nurse trailer filled to 90% on a cool morning, as the air temperature rises, the product expands and causes the pressure relief valve to let product escape. Randall Farmers Coop Union Policy is not to fill above 85%.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Randall Farmers Coop Union has an Emergency Action Plan and a Safety Director. All areas have worked with the county, city and, insurance company loss control department for the development of these plans.\n\n\n\n7.Planned Safety Changes\n\nThe Operations Manager, tours the Branch once per month. All Areas are toured once a quarter by the company safety director. Changes are made on an as needed basis as new regulations or concerns"
