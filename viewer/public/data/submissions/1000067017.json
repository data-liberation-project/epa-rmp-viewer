St. Gabriel facility (Harcros) handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Harcros' policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\r\nOur emergency response program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers is subject to RMP Program Level 3.  A toluene diisocyanate process which was included in the 2013 version of the RMP is no longer active at the facility, and therefore has been removed from the current submittal.\r\n\r\n3.

This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  \r\n\r\nA summary of our Prevention Program\r\nSAFETY INFORMATION - Our facilities maintain current copies of Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous chemicals stored including Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  This facility has access to all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.  Much of the information in these pamphlets is applicable to the storage of sulfur dioxide also.   \r\nHAZARD REVIEW - A hazard review is conducted for all regulated processes at least every 5 years.  For chlorine & sulfur dioxide storage, we primarily use the Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) method.   Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these reviews are documented and addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - We have Standard Operating Procedures covering all aspects of storage and movement of containers.  The documentation is maintained and updated at the corporate level in the online Safety Management System (SMS) database.\r\n\r\nTRAINING - All new drivers and warehouse personnel attend a 3 to 4 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that store and transfer chlorine & sulfur dioxide receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to those chemicals.  Refresher training is conducted periodically in accordance with the corporate training mandates. \r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE - For the sulfur dioxide and chlorine container storage process, we perform visual inspections of containers when received and before loading for delivery to customers.  In addition, we perform daily inspections and routine maintenance on the forklift trucks used to mo"

In addition, all containers and vehicles are maintained per U.S. Department of Transportation requirements.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION - We have an Incident Investigation Standard Operating Procedure which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as \"near-misses\" that could have lead to injuries and releases.  These reports are reviewed by corporate safety personnel and are shared with all facilities within the company.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT - The corporate policy has been revised to implement a compliance audit at least every 3 years for every process to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.  Deficiencies discovered during audits are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n4. Five year accident history\r\nIn the past 5 years, this facility has not experienced any incidents related to the storage and handling of RMP regulated chemicals.\r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program\r\nThis facility's emergency response program for incidents involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon The Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required. All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment on simulated leaks. We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\r\n\r\nOur response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only. We will not respond to other types of emergencies, but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel, if required. In addition to the chlorine response plan, we have a regularly updated Emergency Action Plan, which covers evacuations and notifications for all types of"
