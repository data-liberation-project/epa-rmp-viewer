This facility believes that an employees suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.\n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n* Oxide line replacement from carbon steel to stainless steel\n* Upgraded and implemented site-wide security system (guardhouse, gates and card access)\n* Changing check valves on oxide lines with fewer gaskets and leak points"
