The facility is located at 1925 Lone Star Drive, Dallas, Texas 75212.  The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 300 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, five days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh and preserve food safety standards.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe current capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.  The system normally functions as two separate systems however there is crossover piping that permits one system to operate equipment in the other system.  The facility has never experienced a significant release incident.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of chan"

The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\nThe system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room.  The system shutdown can be manually operated using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place.\n \nQuality Sausage Company has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.
