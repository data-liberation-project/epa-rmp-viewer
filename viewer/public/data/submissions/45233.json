JOE\n\nWASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nPolicy\nIt is the policy of the City of Port St. Joe's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine is minimized and if there is a release, the offsite consequence will be reduced.  To accomplish this, the chlorine ton containers, pipe lines, fittings and injectors are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices, DOT regulations and Chlorine Institute's specifications.  Our operations and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine system are trained annually in the requirements of chlorine safety.\n\nDescription of Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant Operation\nThe City of Port St. Joe operates a domestic wastewater treatment plant that receives the effluent from the City of Port St. Joe and portions of Gulf County. The NPDES permit requires that all domestic sewage entering the treatment plant be disinfected.  To accomplish this, the WWTP injects chlorine gas into the raw domestic sewage.\n\nDescription of Chlorine System\nThe chlorine system consists of ton containers connected through an injector into the force main feeding the chlorine contact system.  The chlorinated waste water flows into a contact chamber to obtain the required contact time for proper disinfection.  Chlorine feed rate is based on the need to maintain a residual chlorine concentration in the domestic wastewater.  Chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinder by vacuum through a Wallace & Tiernan V-75 Chlorinator without an external vaporizer.\n\nRMP requirements at the Facility\nA review of all the materials used at the WWTP has determined that chlorine is the only substance at or above a threshold quantity of an RMP regulated substance.  The quantity of chlorine used triggers the need for a worst-case release scenario offsite impact; thus a Program level 2 RMP has been developed.\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be i"

The maximum quantity of chlorine that will be released in a worst-case scenario is 2,000 pounds at a release rate of 200 poundes per minute.  A worst-case release of any one container will not cause an effect on the other containers.  The distance to the endpoint for this scenario is 3.0 miles using the Model Aloha 5.2.1 \n\nAdministrative Controls\nThere are no administrative controls on chlorine inventory in use at the facility.\n\nPassive controls\nThere are no passive control measures in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative release scenario\nA container is in service with a regulator in place.  The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off.  This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the container.  The total release quantity of chlorine will be 23.4 pounds or 0.39 pounds per minute and last for 60 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint using the Model ALOHA 5.2.1 is 125 yards.  Under all conditions of alternative release scenarios there will be no offsite impact from the chlorine system.\n\nFive-year accidental release history\nThere have been no RMP releases of chlorine within the five years of 2006 to date.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nAn OSHA PSM program is not required for this facility for chlorine.  Our operators are trained in chlorine safety and correct operating procedures.  The operators conduct inspection rounds of the WWTP daily, including the chlorine system, to insure the WWTP is operating correctly.  Any concerns, including safety of the chlorine process, are reported to the maintenance department so corrective action can be taken.  Our maintenance employees are trained in chlorine safety and how to complete the required work. Routine maintenance checks of the system are conducted every Monday.\n\nGeneral prevention activities\nThe facility has a staff of experienced and knowledgeable employees that receive re"

Each employee working with chlorine has the training and experience needed to approach a leak, determine its cause and take corrective action.  Any event involving a release of chlorine is investigated, documented and corrective actions are taken.\n\nEmergency response program\nThis facility's employees will respond to an emergency release scenario of chlorine which could have an offsite consequence according to the procedures set forth in the WWTP Chlorine SOP and the Emergency Response Plan.  The Gulf County Emergency Management Agency and the City of Port St. Joe Fire Department have been informed of the storage of chlorine and have a copy of this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Gulf County Emergency Management Agency and the City of Port St. Joe Fire Department were given the opportunity to inspect the site and make recommendations for inclusion in this Risk Management Program development. Their recommendations are included in the documentation."
