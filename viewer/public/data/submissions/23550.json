Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this production facility, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that makes (TDI) valuable as a formulation component also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling (TDI) to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle (TDI) combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program incorporates the hazards of (TDI) and reflects the emergency response requirements associated with the use of (TDI). Resource information is provided by the supplier and the \" Polyurethane Division of  the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc \". The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture adhesives for commercial and industrial customers. (TDI)  is used in the manufacture of Liofol adhesives. (TDI)  is received by tank truck and stored in an 8,000- gallon bulk tank that is located in a contained storage room. (TDI) is a component in our Liofol product line. The finished adhesive products are distributed by contracted over the road carriers to our commercial customers. This facility has unloading equipment for unloading tank trucks directly to our bulk storage tank. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized "

The full capacity of this tank is 81,440 pounds at a storage temperature of 75 F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a liquid and vapor over a 10-minute period. \nThe distance to the endpoint of the worst-case scenario is 0.60 miles. \n                                                                                                                                                                 Alternative Scenario. - A transfer hose failure of a 15 foot length of 2 inch hose. The emergency stop valve does not function properly . The contents of the tank truck are released. The resulting unconfined  vapor may travel  beyond the plant boundary. The liquid is contained in the unloading area spill basin.\nThe distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario is less than 0.10 mile.  \n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis production facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard  (PSM) and with all applicable state codes and City of Elgin, Illinois regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30, the 1999 National Electric Code and the ANSI Code for Pressure Piping, ANSI B31.3-1993 or ANSI B31.1.  All of our employees have been trained under HAZWOPER and given safe handling and unloading procedure training for  (TDI).\n\n5. Five-year accident history. \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at this facility in the last five years. This is a new facility.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility's emergency response program incorporates the hazards of (TDI) and reflects the emergency response requirements associated with the use of (TDI).
