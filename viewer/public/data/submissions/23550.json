Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this production facility, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that makes (TDI) valuable as a formulation component also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling (TDI) to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle (TDI) combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program incorporates the hazards of (TDI) and reflects the emergency response requirements associated with the use of (TDI). Resource information is provided by the supplier and the \" Polyurethane Division of  the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc \". The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture adhesives for commercial and industrial customers. (TDI)  is used in the manufacture of Liofol adhesives. (TDI)  is received by tank truck and stored in an 8,000- gallon bulk tank that is located in a contained storage room. (TDI) is a component in our Liofol product line. The finished adhesive products are distributed by contracted over the road carriers to our commercial customers. This facility has unloading equipment for unloading tank trucks directly to our bulk storage tank. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized"
