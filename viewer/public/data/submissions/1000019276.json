      "SummaryText": "PURPOSE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN RESUBMISSION / UPDATE\n\nStolthaven Houston Inc. is updating the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) in January of 2011 to revise the operating scenario for a regulated toxic substance to be handled in a newly covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  Note that this RMP regulated substance is already present at the facility above the applicable threshold quantity.  The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n- Updating the RMP pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 68, Section A? 68.190(b)(4), due to Stolthaven Houston Inc. commencing the storage and associated parcel shipments of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) from the facility's D Tank Farm in existing Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-30-10 above the threshold quantity for TDI of 10,000-pounds.  Stolthaven Houston currently stores TDI in two other existing Low-Pressure Tanks also located in the facility's D Tank Farm.  \n\n- Updating the estimated residential populations living within the predicted 'distance-to-endpoint' for the various Worst-Case Release scenarios associated with this RMP based on the Landview 6 software created by the EPA, the Census Bureau, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).  \n\n- Minor RMP data element updates based on revisions to Stolthaven Houston's 'Process Safety and Risk Management Program Manual' and the 'Local Training Manual (LTM)' made since the previous RMP update submitted in March of 2010.  \n\n\nA? 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc. we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes related to bulk chemical storage and distribution in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the citizens of the surrounding communities.
