This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently, Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration systems. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration for our production, cold storage and distribution operations. Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Smithfield - Clinton Plant is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Worst Case and the Alternative Case Release Scenarios for the covered process have been completed and are discussed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 1.07) was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp (Revision 1.07)) model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file with the Smithfield - Clinton Plant Environmental Manager.
