If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.  It is the policy of Coash Inc. that any personnel that will be handling, involved in storage, or transportation of NH3 will be trained in the safe handling of it.\n\nThe primary activity at Coash Inc. is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and wholesale customers.  Chemicals and lawn fertilizer are also sold.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\nThe maximum storage would be 126,000 lbs. in two 12,000 gallon tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be 20 ton to unload a truck transport.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of one of our storage tanks would be 63,000 lbs. over ten minutes.  The distance to the end point is 2.01 using the Degadis Modeling.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in the transfer hose at our Anhydrous Ammonia site.  The distance to that end point is .73 miles based on Degadis Modeling.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property dammage at our facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering place, property damage or enviromental dammage.\n\nOur facility has implemented the following:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc. A written emergen"

Coash Inc strives to provide all employees with a safe and healthy working enviroment.  We feel each employee has a personal responsibility to work safely and maintain a workplace that is free of unsafe and hazardous conditions.
