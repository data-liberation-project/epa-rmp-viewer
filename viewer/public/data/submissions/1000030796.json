RMP requirement is codified in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  PSM requirement is codified in Occupational Safety & Health Administration Title 29 Code of Federal Regulation 1910.119 (29 CFR 1910.119).  \n\n\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nStion manufactures high-efficiency, thin-film solar panels.  Stion stores and uses four regulated chemicals.   There are 3 chemicals subject to RMP, including hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide and diborane. Only hydrogen selenide exceed the RMP's thresholds.    There are four (4) chemicals subject to PSM, including hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, diethyl zinc and diborane.   Only hydrogen selenide exceeds the PSM's threshold.  \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \n\n\n\nAn Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) was prepared in support of this RMP and PSM requirement. This analysis utilized the methodologies recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Details of the OCA are summarized below.  \n\n\n\nThe OCA considered two different types of releases.  The first, \"worst-case\" releases, predicated by RMP regulation, assume that the largest single vessel of hydrogen selenide fails catastrophically - whether or not a credible mode for such failure exists.   The second, \"alternative\" releases are more realistic potential site failures presented based on the findings of the process hazard analyses and other guidance.  For both worst-case and alternative release scenarios, modeling was conducted to provide an estimate of the chemical's expected dispersion in the atmosphere and to determine if there is any potential impact beyond the facility fence line.  In some instances, credits for mitigation features (e.g., interlocks, alarms, secondary cont"

      "SummaryText": "ainment, structure mitigation of release to outside air, etc.) are taken where allowed by the regulation.\n\n\n\nThese OCA results are as follows: (1) 3.8 miles (worst-case release, distance to end point based on RMP*COMP model; and (2) 0.83 miles (alternative release, distance to end point based on ALOHA model and ERPG-2). \n\n\n\nIt should be stressed here that the risk of these types of releases is very remote and have not historically occurred at the facility.  Nevertheless, this OCA projects potential areas of concern that might require emergency response measures in the event that a serious accident involving hydrogen selenide were to occur.\n\n\n\nStion Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy \n\n\n\nIn accordance with Stion's Environmental Health and Safety policy, Stion is committed to protecting and preserving the environment in all its business operations. Included in the policy is a commitment to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and to foster a safe and secure work environment by increasing employee knowledge and awareness of environmental, health and safety best practices.  The Stion's facility has developed several programs to drive continual improvement of environmental performance, including an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.\n\n"
