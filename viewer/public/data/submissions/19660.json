This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  As of May 1999, the Bradford Gas Plant has worked since it's inception in 1983, without a Lost Time Accident.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Bradford Gas Plant, located 9 miles south of I-20 on Hwy. 349, in Midland County, operates a variety of processes to produce a petroleum product called NGL from natural gas.  The Bradford Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including methane, ethane, propane, iso butane, butane isopentane and pentane.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Bradford Gas Plant has two Program Level 1 processes, both flammable substances.\n\nThe first worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the Bradford  Gas Plant is a flammable mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs).  A vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of NGLs, contained in a single vessel/storage tank is assumed to release and ignite. The total amount released would be 100,000 lbs. The maximum distance to to 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 miles.  The second scenario is also a flammable mixture, a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving 36,000 pounds of NGLs in storage.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.3 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in 'Operator Rounds' sheet. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \nThe facility also has access to technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nContractors\n \nThe  Bradford Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazard"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Bradford Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n \nSafe Work Practices\n \nThe Bradford Gas Plant  has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n \nIncident Investigation\n \nThe  Bradford Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to "

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \nCompliance Audits\n \nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the  Bradford Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n \nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nThe processes at the Bradford Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n \nUniversal Prevention Activities\n \nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Bradford Gas Plant .  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \nSpecialized Safety Features\n \nThe Bradford Gas Plant  has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences "

Atmospheric relief devices.\n \n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \n The Bradford Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. \n \n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n \n The  Bradford Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan  identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Bradford Gas Plant facilities.  The Emergency Action Plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Bradford Gas Plant has been coordinated with the local emergency responders, Midland Fire Department.  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident.  The Brad"
