      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of Heimerl Farms Ltd., 3891 Mink Rd., Johnstown, OHIO 43031 and its administrators to prevent an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by maintaining equipment and training employees in proper storage, handling, and use of the material. In the event of an emergency, we would rely on the Johnstown-Monroe Fire Department, Licking County Hazardous Materials Handling Team, and on site administrators to control the situation. The stationary source is comprised of two (2) interconnected storage tanks containing 20,000 pounds each, or 40,000 pounds in combination. The worst case scenario, as designated in the Risk Management Plan would include a total loss of the contents stored in both storage tanks. The alternative release scenario, as designated in the Risk Management Plan would include partial losses as a result of a transfer hose failure. There are no administrative controls which can prevent or limit the distance of the potential material release. Mitigation measures are comprised of excess flow valves which restrict flow of product. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are to adhere to the normal operating procedures designed in the use of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer tanks. The five-year accident history is void of any releases from the storage tank facility. The emergency response program in case of an ammonia leak are as follows: 1) evacuate all non-essential personnel to the main office building; 2) notify management and on site Emergency Action Plan Coordinator; 3) determine size of leak, if less than 100 pounds and with the use of PPE, stop the flow of gas is feasible; 4) notify local fire department, notify Licking County Hazardous Materials Handling Team, notify Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, notify Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Notify Ohio Department of Agriculture, notify CHEMTREC; notify Risk Coordinator. There are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
