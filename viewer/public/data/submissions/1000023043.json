Replace all parts, hoses, etc. that are not in good condition with approved parts.\n\n\n\n2.    Emergency response policy.\n\n     ?    Remain calm\n\n     ?    Assess the situation\n\n     ?    Notify fire department of the existing emergency\n\n     ?    Evacuate people in the downwind path of the vapor cloud movement\n\n     ?    Prevent motorists from driving thru the area downwind of the emergency\n\n     ?    Approach the accident from the upwind side, after putting on protective clothing    and a full face gas mask with ammonia canister\n\n     ?    Close the valve between the tank and the leak\n\n\n\n3.    Facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\n     ?    Only anhydrous ammonia is handled at the facility.  There is one 18,000-gallon storage tank, 11 nurse tanks at the facility, filling stand, and a pump house.  It is located on the north side of the village.\n\n\n\n4.    Worse-case release scenario.\n\n     ?    The worse case scenario the release of 112710 pounds of anhydrous ammonia gas into the air at a rate of 11271 pounds per minute.  The toxic endpoint would be 1.4 miles with a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour.\n\n\n\n5.    Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n     ?    We comply with the Illinois Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Products Inspection & Standards and they inspect the facility yearly.\n\n\n\n6.    Five year accident history\n\n     ?    The site has had no accidents is the past five years.\n\n\n\n7.    Emergency response programs\n\n     ?    We are in cooperation with the Sheffield Fire Department.  They have practiced safety on the anhydrous tanks; their last practice was in October 2010.\n\n\n\n8.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     ?    We keep abreast of any necessary changes that need to be implemented through reading of various periodicals and attending required training sessions given by the Illinois Fertilizer & Chemical Association, Inc.\n\n"
