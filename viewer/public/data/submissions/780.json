      "SummaryText": "The process described in this plan involves the City of Springfield OH Water Treatment Plant, herein called the WTP.  Water treatment uses chlorine as a disinfectant to purify the City\u0012s drinking water.  Chlorinators, used in the process, are designed to control and meter the flow of chlorine gas, mix the chlorine gas with water and to deliver the resultant water solution to the point of application.\n\nChlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders which are specifically designed to prevent leaks.  The cylinders themselves are equipped with protective valve caps to prevent an inadvertent release and the valves are recessed into the end of the cylinder to protect them from being damaged during shipment or unloading.  On an average, 6 cylinders are stored in the chlorine process room.  Only two of these cylinders are actually connected to the chlorinators at any one time.  The remaining 4 cylinders are nested in cradles designed to prevent their movement.  The cradles are backed up against a brick wall to prevent a cylinder from self-propelling should a valve malfunction.\n\nThe two cylinders connected to the chlorinators are controlled electronically by a central computer which regulates the amount of chlorine mixed with water.  The chlorinator operates under a vacuum produced by the flow of water.  Chlorine gas under pressure enters the chlorinator where it is electrically heated to reduce deposits of impurities and to prevent reliquefaction of the gas when the chlorinator is shut down with the chlorine supply turned off.\n\nThe chlorine process room is continuously monitored by a chlorine gas detector.  A sample of air is continuously withdrawn from within the room for the presence of chlorine.  In the event of a chlorine gas leak, which gives rise to the presence of as little as 1 ppm chlorine, the chloralert will activate the alarm circuit, all interconnected safety devices which includes the ventilation system, and the alarm light and horn.  The horn is audible throughout t"

      "SummaryText": "he entire facility.\n\nEmergency response policy directs plant operators to first determine if the leak is a non-emergency type leak.  This action can be accomplished by visually observing the room and system from outside the room.  If this is the case, maintenance personnel will effect the repair action.  If the operator determines that the leak is an emergency condition, an evacuation is immediately ordered and Springfield Fire/Rescue is notified through 9-1-1.  Fire/Rescue is trained on chlorine emergency response procedures at the WTP using the Chlorine Repair Kit B and a spare chlorine cylinder on at least an annual basis.\n\nOther accident prevention methods incorporated into the plant policy involve routine preventative maintenance on the chlorinator system and chlorine process room, mandatory training of all plant personnel (management, maintenance & operators) covering operating and emergency procedures on an annual basis and written operating procedures.  In addition, OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) policies and practices are addressed in both the WTP written operating procedures and the PSM Risk Management Plan.\n\nA risk assessment has been performed in order to determine worst-case and alternate-case scenarios should an actual release occur.  An absolute worst-case scenario would assume all passive and active mitigation failed.  In this case, chlorine gas would be released from the 2000lb cylinder at a rate of 200lbs/min.  In 10 minutes the room would be filled and the exhaust would allow the gas to exit the facility.  Wind speed of 1.5 meters/second would allow the gas to travel approximately 1.3 miles.  Within the 1.3 mile radius are public receptors such as residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and recreational areas and schools.  Estimated population is 2,000.\n\nAn alternate-case scenario, which assumes also there are system failures, might include the shearing off of a valve on the cylinder.  In this case, chlorine gas would be rele"

The same public receptors as the worst-case scenario would be affected.\n\nThis site has not experienced any accidental releases in the past five years."
