      "SummaryText": "The RMP worst case scenario is the rupture of a 2 in. transfer line outside of any buildings.  This was calculated to have a more severe impact than the rupture of a storage or receiving tank.  The alternate scenario is the rupture of the largest line feeding the plate freezers.  We used this scenario because it was estimated to be the most likely event to occur.  All ammonia tanks and piping are routinely inspected and maintained to minimize the chances of a release.  We have not had any releases within the past five years and, hopefully, our preventative maintenance program will prevent any future release.  The location of our facility on Unalaska Island of the Aleutian chain in Alaska does not belong to any county or borough.  We chose the closest choice for our area for that section of the RMP, but we are outside the parameters of that listing so an error message occurs.  We have contacted EPA and their hotline and they are aware of the problem with their RMP submit program and saidthis will not make the application incomplete.  Because our facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the specified emergency contact person may or may not be available at the time of a release.  He could be off shift or on vacation.  Because of this, the following is a list of emergency contact personnel.  The first emergency contact should be our powerhouse at (907) 581-7537.  It is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Steve Tate or Dave Kuehl would be the contact personnel.  If they aren't available, the person answering the phone will forward the information to the appropriate people.  Alternative contact personnel are:  Greg Peters (907) 581-7543, Dana Frojen (907) 581-7528, and Reid Frojen (907) 581-7545.  In addition, Alyeska Seafoods night watchman may be contacted at (907) 391-1664 or on VHF channel 9.  The watchman can then notify the appropriate people."
