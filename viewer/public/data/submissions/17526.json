      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company in Langdon are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This committment os an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such release does occur, our trained emergency personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Langdon Fire Department, which provides additinal emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in a 25,000-gallon tank at our facility in Langdon (Figure 1, ammonia).  The maximum amount stored is 21,250 gallons (109352.5 pounds)at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\nWe also have propane stored in 3-18,000-gallon tanks located at our facility in Langdon (Figure 1, propane).  The maximum amount stored is 54,000 gallons (229,500pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternative case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n    3.1 Ammonia\n\nThe worst cse release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entiare contenets of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank (109,325.5 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.8 miles (Figure 2). the estimated population within a 4.8 mile radius of"

      "SummaryText": " this facility is 2400.\n\nThe laternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The scenario involves the release of 7,616.42 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population withing a 0.31-mile radius of the facility is 5. \n    \n    3.2 Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the propane storage tank (41,279.825 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.28 miles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result in serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.28-mile radius of this facility is 3. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that contacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.12 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within 0.12-mile radius of this facility is 3. \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in  the processes.\n\nTraining\nFarmers Union Oil Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFarmers Union Oil Company conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Farmers Union Oil Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nFarmers Union Oil Company routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nFarmers Union Oil Company conducts compliance au"

Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nFarmers Union Oil Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nFarmers Union Oil Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public."
