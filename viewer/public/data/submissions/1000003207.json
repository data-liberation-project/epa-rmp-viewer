The Dos Rios facility also utilizes liquefied gaseous sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the final effluent. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide is stored at the site in a quantity greater than the threshold for the Accidental Release Prevention Rules set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. SAWS has determined that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and handling faciltiy on site is a Program 2 Process.  SAWS has upgraded its chemical storage area by enclosing it and is in the process of installing a scrubber system for containment. The facility is not subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Plan rule and does not operate under one of the SIC codes listed in 40 CFR 68.10 (d) (1).\n\nThe goals of the SAWS Risk Management Program are to:\n\n* Protect public health and safety\n\n* Reduce the potential of an accidental release of chlorine\n\n* Minimize impacts should a release occur\n\nThe Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, prepared by the American Water Works Association and the AWWA Research  Foundation, and sponsored by EPA was used to develop this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThis plan contains a management program that details responsibility for implementing  and updating the RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted to estimate potential environmental and public receptors that could be impacted by a worst-case and alternative release scenario. A Program 2 Prevention Program was prepared that documents a management program, safety information on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, the results of the hazard review, written operating and maintenance procedures and descriptions of training, compliance audit and incident investigation procedures.\n\nSAWS has detemined that it will rely on local emergency response personnel to coordinate off-site activities in the event of a "

SAWS has an emergency response program to train employees to indentify the source of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak and to implement emergency notification procedures. SAWS provides annual in-house HazMat training for the emergency response employees.  SAWS works with the San Antonio Fire Department to ensure that proper emergency reponse procedures are in-place for responding to a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. SAWS is an active member of the Bexar County Local Emergency Planning Committee and has participated in an LEPC video for informing residents about chlorine and other hazardous materials in their community."
