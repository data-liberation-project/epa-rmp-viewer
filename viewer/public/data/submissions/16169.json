      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt Foamex LP Elkhart, Indiana, Plant No. 2  we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce bedding, furniture, and carpet pad and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by tank truck, and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in storage tanks at our plant is about 600, 000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is conveyed to cutting stations where it is cut"

      "SummaryText": "to the size and shape specified by our customers.\n\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceed EPA's threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoamex LP Elkhart, Indiana Plant No.2\nRMP Executive Summary\nJune 18 1999\nPage 2\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance:\n\n7 Most people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated.\n\nWorst case release scenarios.  Catastrophic failure of a TDI storage tank, having a capacity of 80,000 lbs. TDI, would be a worst case release for a toxic substance because a TDI storage tank is the largest TDI container at the plant. We assumed that the entire contents of the storage tank would be released as a liquid, form a pool that would spread to cover an area of approximately 1,600 ft2 with a depth of about 0.4 inches (1 cm).

      "SummaryText": "a distance of 45 ft. from the storage tank to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm.\n\nIt should be noted that the data entered in Section 2: Toxic Worst Case of the RMP Submit document reflects a release rate of 1 lb/min. and a distance to endpoint of 085 mile.  These values were the minimum that the software program would accept.  The actual (correct) information should be a release rate of .0032 lb/min., and distance to endpoint of .0085 mile. \n\nAlternate Release Scenarios.  Rupture of the transfer line from a TDI storage tank would release TDI to the ground at the standard pump rate of 1,000 lb/min.  We assumed that the release would continue for the 45 minutes required for an employee to stop the pump using remote emergency shutdown controls.  The resulting pool would spread to cover an area of approximately 1,600 ft2 with a depth of 0.4 inches. Refined dispersion modeling predicts a distance of less than 33 ft. from the pool to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI will not impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM).  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n- Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment\n- Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n- Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n\n\n\nFoamex LP Elkhart, I"
