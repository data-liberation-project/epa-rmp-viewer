This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\n2. Stationary source activities\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled\n\n\n\nRelease scenario analysis\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\n\n\nEmergency response preparedness program\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is ARYZTA LLC policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. The Austin Plant has developed a Risk Management a description of the risk management system, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Austin Plant is located in Travis County, Texas. The plant produces par-baked goods and frozen dough. The products are frozen, packaged and stored in a frozen goods warehouse prior to shipment. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for freezing/cooling and for frozen finished goods storage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration systems at the Austin Plant is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The ammonia system is a closed loop which recirculates and reuses the same material. Infrequent makeup to the system is only to replace material lost due to maintenance activities and a small intermittent purge and/or fugitive leaks. The system consists of vessels, compressors, evaporators, icemakers, condensers, safety relief systems, ammonia detectors and alarms. All leaks are addressed and the system charge is maintained at intended levels. \n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nA worst-case release s"

      "SummaryText": "cenario was defined to determine the potential emergency response procedures needed for the facility and community; however, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant. The Worst Case scenario release for the Austin plant is a total release of 12, 650 lbs. of ammonia released over 10 minutes. On the other hand, the alternative release scenarios are based on credible assumptions. The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios from the Ammonia Model RMP and is representative of a pipe leak. The Alternate release for the Austin plant is 7,320 lbs. of ammonia released over 60 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been no release of ammonia from the Austin Plant in the last five years that meets the RMP reporting criteria. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Preparedness Program\n\n\n\nThe Austin Plant has an emergency response preparedness program which is described in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP). This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur. The plan also includes first aid procedures\n\n for toxic exposures to ammonia. The ERP is coordinated with Austin Fire Department. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia systems according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner. The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of this program.
