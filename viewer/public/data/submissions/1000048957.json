      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\r\n\r\nThis submission updates the Sanitary District of Hammond (HSD) Risk Management Plan (RMP) dated March 16, 2010.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nHSD is a municipal wastewater treatment facility in Hammond, Indiana.  Employees of HSD, as well as contractors and subcontractors, are subject to potential risks of personal injury from exposure to noxious gases.  The gases of concern are chlorine (Cl2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) which are listed under Section 112 (risk management program to prevent and respond to accidental releases of regulated substances) of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments.  In addition, HSD is required to comply with Federal, State and Local regulations on wastewater treatment and solid waste management as they apply to waste treatment facilities.  HSD has prepared this RMP to meet Section 112 requirements, which is summarized herein.  Since the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM regulations, Program 3 of the risk management program is applicable to the covered processes, i.e., storage of Cl2 and SO2 at HSD.\r\n\r\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nHSD uses Cl2 and SO2 in the treatment of wastewater to ensure that microbes in the discharge or effluent are substantially killed or destroyed and the chlorine level in the effluent is sufficiently low and does not impact water quality of the receiving stream, i.e., Grand Calumet River.  Cl2 and SO2 are supplied as a liquefied compressed gas in one-ton containers having the capacity of 2,000 pounds each.  Standard containers valves are provided for the ton containers which are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices (fusible plugs).  These fusible plugs are designed  to yield or melt between 158F and 165F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature.\r\n\r\nEmployees are responsible for the transfer of ton containers from the delivery truck to the facility (Chlorine Building"

      "SummaryText": ").  The off-loading or transfer is achieved by using an overhead crane or hoist to avoid damaging the valves.  All containers are stored on designated wooden racks or scales in a horizontal position.  On-line use, staging and storage of all full ton containers occur inside the Chlorine Building located approximately 200 feet east of the Administration Building.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed and are currently being followed by the facility personnel.  The SOPs include handling of ton containers during loading/offloading, staging and storage.  MSDS sheets regarding specific chemical information and safe handling are kept on site and made available to all employees .   Formal process has been implemented and documented to meet PHA requirements.  To date, employees who work at the Chlorine Building have been trained and have a good understanding of what the hazards are and the safety procedures for handling chemicals used in the processes.  Written maintenance procedures have been prepared to document the maintenance program for the facility\u00bfs covered processes.  Maintenance personnel perform regular inspections of the Chlorine Building and the associated equipment, and provide preventive maintenance as necessary.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThe Sanitary District of Hammond has a written emergency response plan.  The facility\u00bfs emergency response program is coordinated with the Hammond Fire Department (dial 911) and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)(Attn:  Kevin Doolin, Lake County Emergency Planning Committee (LCEPC), 2900 W93rd Ave., Crown Point, IN 46307, Phone:  (219) 756-8302).  For large spills or releases, the Fire Department may solicit assistance from the Lake County HazMat Team, Phone:  (219)755-3512."
