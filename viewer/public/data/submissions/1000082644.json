This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will evaluate the situation, and with assistance from Van Field personnel and the Van Volunteer Fire Department will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\n    The Van Gas Plant, located in Van, TX, operates a process to produce petroleum product called NGL or Natural Gas Liquids. The boundaries of the stationary source are defined by the external fence surrounding the facility. NGL is a flammable liquid that is stored under pressure and is composed of methane, ethane, propane, normal-butane, iso-butane, normal-pentane and iso-pentane which are regulated flammable hydrocarbons. The Van Gas Plant does not use and/or process any regulated toxic substances. \n\n\n\n    \n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\n    The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because the process at the Gas Plant that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n    Employee Participation\n\n\n\n    Management at the Van Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process "

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Personnel from other Chevron facilities who are knowledgeable in the audit process participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n    CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n    The process at the Van Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\n    Specialized Safety Features\n\n\n\n    The Van Gas Plant has safety features to help contain/control a release and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\n\n\n    Release Containment/Control\n\n\n\n    1. Process relief valves \n\n\n\n    2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n\n\n    3. Automated shutdown and/or alarm systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure, low pressure, high level, low level, etc.)\n\n\n\n    4. Curbing to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\n    5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n\n\n\n    Release Mitigation\n\n\n\n    1. Fire Extinguishers\n\n\n\n    2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., fire retardant clothing)\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Van Gas Plant has an excellent record (no incidents that resulted in onsite or offsite effects) of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  However, if an incident did occur, we would investigate the incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Van Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The action plan addresses proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.

      "SummaryText": "ive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant process or other Van Gas Plant facilities.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency action plan for the Van Gas Plant is coordinated with the Van Zandt County, TX local emergency planning committee (LEPC) but more specifically with the Van Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Van Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC official and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. The Van Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency table top/evacuation drills that the LEPC and emergency response organizations are invited to participate in, and the gas plant provides information to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant if they change.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Van Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, safety audits and incident investigations, some of which result in modifications to the process.  As conditions are identified where improvements in safety can be made, the Van Gas Plant will maintain an active plan to implement appropriate changes to the overall safety of the system. For example, to address a concern statement/recommendation from the most recent PHA, a section of piping on the JT Skid has been recently replaced and upgraded from 150 class to 600 class, thus providing inherent safety which will prevent loss of containment from happening in the case of overpressure in the system.\n\n\n\n"
