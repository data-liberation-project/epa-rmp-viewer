All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the\r\nplan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency\r\ninteraction.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Poplar Street WPCP utilizes chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater before it is\r\nreturned to the Ocmulgee  River.  Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine cylinders,\r\nchlorination equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, and process safety\r\nequipment.  \r\n\r\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance\r\ntraveled by chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical \"toxic\r\nendpoint.\"  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the\r\nmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals\r\ncould be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening\r\nhealth effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic\r\nendpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine for the Lower Poplar Street WPCP involves a\r\nfailure of a one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 lbs.  When atmospheric\r\ndispersion modeling for this unlikely scenario was performed using the RMP*Comp.\r\nVersion 1.06 a distance to a toxic endpoint of .9 urban miles was obtained.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for all chlorination processes involves tubing\r\nfailure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of 317 lbs. of chlorine. \r\nWhen atmospheric disp"
