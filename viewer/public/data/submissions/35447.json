MeadWestvaco remains committed to maintaining the integrity of a workplace safety program that is among the industry?s best.  \n\nMeadWestvaco?s Packaging Resources Group in Covington, VA has two substances that fall under the EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The regulated substances handled at the source in excess of their applicable threshold qualities are chlorine dioxide (CAS No. 10049-04-4) and chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5).  There are six covered processes using chlorine and one covered process using chlorine dioxide.\n\nIn eac"

Written safe operating procedures, including emergency guidelines, that are reviewed annually;\n!    Regular preventive maintenance of critical equipment to prevent mechanical breakdowns;\n!    A tank integrity program that ensures safe storage of materials;\n!    Processes that are manned and monitored 24 hours a day;\n!    Safety systems that include emergency relief systems, remotely-activated isolation valves, and interlocking systems to shut down a process;\n!    Scheduled safety audits;\n!    Regular process hazard analysis to identify and correct potential safety concerns;\n!    Detailed safety reviews completed prior to startup following any changes made to our equipment or processes; and\n!    Thorough and regular safety and operational training for employees who work with processes that involve potentially hazardous materials.\n\nIn addition to the above, the chlorine dioxide process has these safety systems in place:\n\n!    All operators undergo extensive operator training and qualification programs;\n!    Storage tanks are diked;\n!    Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on-site and not transported from off-site;\n!    Continuous monitoring systems are in place for the production, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide within the mill, including extensive leak detection monitors; and\n!    Vented gas is captured in a collection system.\n\nThe chlorine process has these additional safety systems in place:\n\n!    All operators undergo extensive operator training and qualification program;\n!    Chlorine residuals are checked regularly;\n!    If water flow is lost to the system, gas flow is stopped; and\n!    Area atmosphere is continuously monitored and alarms will sound if chlorine is detected.\n\n\nRegarding the five-year accident history, there have been no incidents at the Covington Mill over the past five years that resulted in injuries, death, or significant property damage on-site; nor have"

      "SummaryText": " there been known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage or environmental damage associated with any of the regulated processes.\n\nThe site is also subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The purpose of this regulation and MeadWestvaco?s PSM program is to prevent accidental releases and to minimize the consequence if one should occur.  The location also has an Emergency Response Program in place that includes:\n\n!    Two full time nurses, a first aid squad, and a  firefighter team specifically including  structural firefighting  all on site;\n!    Participation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee; \n!    Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases;\n!    Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure;\n!    Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n!    Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing and maintenance;\n!    Training of all employees in relevant procedures, and;\n!    Procedures to review and update the emergency action plan as appropriate.    \n\nEnsuring safe operations will continue to be a foremost priority for MeadWestvaco.  In that regard and as part of Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each covered process.  The most recent Process Hazard Analyses for chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been completed with all action items completed.  MeadWestvaco?s safety programs are audited internally on a periodic basis and modified or upgraded as needed to help ensure positive risk elimination and prevention."
