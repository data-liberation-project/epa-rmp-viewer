      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCountry Pure Foods in Deland, FL has developed a Risk Management Program in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's final Rule 40 CFR Part 68.  The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\n\r\nThe top priority of Country Pure Foods is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort, Country Pure Foods has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, Country Pure Foods will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the Volusia County Emergency Management to respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nCountry Pure Foods is a juice blending plant located in Deland, FL.  The process includes refrigerated spaces that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS  \r\n\r\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Pr"

      "SummaryText": "dless of trade secrets to ensure employee safety.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\r\n\r\nDespite Country Pure Foods' extensive release prevention program, the facility has experienced one accident in its Five Year Accident History.\r\n\r\nOn 8/22/2013 a piece of equipment fell while replacing a cold wall tank damaging the tank.  No Ammonia was released and no one was injured.  The incident led to $0 in property damage.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCountry Pure Foods is included in the written community emergency response plan.  The facility has its own emergency action plan.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a chemical release.  The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\nCountry Pure Foods does not respond to emergencies.  Country Pure Foods coordinates its Emergency Action Plan with the Volusia County Emergency Management. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nCountry Pure Foods has recently performed a hazard analysis per their Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.  Areas for improvement during the hazard analysis were identified and corrective actions recommended.  All recommendations are promptly addressed."
