This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Morris Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activity is producing Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 3,100-gallon tank at our facility in Morris, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 2,635 gallons (13,559 pounds).The anhydrous ammonia is produced through a three phase plan by using wind energy. This process uses the wind energy to power the facility in creating hydrogen and nitrogen separately. They are then combined, vaporized, and pressurized to create anhydrous ammonia. The final product is stored in the 3,100-gallon tank and is used as nitrogen fertilizer for farmers that wish to use a renewable alternative for their crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility will take all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris will maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes th"

Any findings from the hazard analysis will be addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris will maintain written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures will address various modes of operation; the information will be regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris will have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris will conduct documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks will be conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that will receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks will be corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at West Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions will be promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Rev"

These reviews will be conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris will conduct compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit will be promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees will be strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees will have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\r\nNo accidents have occurred with the anhydrous ammonia tank in the past five (5) years at the facility.\r\n\r\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nWest Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.
