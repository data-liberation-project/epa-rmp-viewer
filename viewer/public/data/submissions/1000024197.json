This facility is aware of the requirements in the areas of Safety, Hazard Reviews, written Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigations.  To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a Operations and Maintenance Manual have been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and oil from various field wells. High pressure gases from the wells are sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in one (1) 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 120 psig. Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in one (1) 1,000 barrel skim tank and two (2) 400 barrel bulk atmospheric storage tanks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane. For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" al"

This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.
