The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Ag Service of McCook, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) The facility has been owned and operated by UAP Pueblo since March 18, 1998.  All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to growers as a fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is recevied, stored and distributed to farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nc) The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 130,000 pounds.  This represents filling the largest storage tank to 85% of capacity.  There are two large storage tanks on site, along with a number of portable tank trailers used to deliver the anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility either by bulk rail car or bulk truck.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of one of the storage tanks being released over a 10-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is "

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nb) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nc) This facility follows the anhydrous ammonia standards established by the Nebraska State Fire Marshall, and is inspected by them on at least an annual basis.\n\nd) This facility is inspected on at least a monthly basis by employees knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\na) Since taking ownership of this facility on March 18, 1998, this facility has had one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  On April 8, 1998, a very small quantity (estimated at less than 2 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia was released from a transfer valve.  An employee sufferred a chemical burn to a small area on one arm, and was treated at the local hospital and released.  There was no property damage as a result of this incident.\n\nb) Prior to our purchase of the facility in March of 1998, this facility was operated by Koch Industries of Wichita, Kansas.  On June 19, 1996, while under Koch Industries Management, approximately 300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released when a hose ruptured due to human error.  There were no injuries as a result of the release.  A small area of grass was burned by the vapors.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\na) This facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nb) This facility has provided State and Local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SAR"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions, as well as to evaluate employee training programs.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations or improvements to be made at this time."
