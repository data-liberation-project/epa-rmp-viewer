This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilitiy's primary activities encompass wholesale chemical distribution. We have five regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include, Hydrofluoric Acid, Ammonia >20%, Formaldehyde solutions, Ethylenediamine, and Isopropylamine.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Brenntag Northeast, Inc. maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Our facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analysis is \"FEMA\" and the \"what if\" methodology. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures: For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Northeast, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining: Brenntag No"

Refresher training is provided as required by regulations and more frequently if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:Brenntag Northeast, Inc. carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Equipment examined by these checks includes; storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel. Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change: Procedures are in place at Brenntag Northeast, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, equipment and procedures. Operators ,maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification are promptly made aware of the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews: Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to major modifications are conducted at Brenntag Northeast, Inc. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\nCompliance Audits: Brenntag Northeast, Inc. conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under RMP are being implemented. These audits are to be carried out at least every three years.\n\nIncident Investigation: Brenntag Northeast, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.\n\nEmployee Participation: Brenntag Northeast, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule.\n\nContractors: On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Brenntag Northeast, Inc. has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of emergency procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nBrenntag Northeast, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental relases over the last five years. Due to our prevention procedures, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nBrenntag Northeast, Inc. maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, and the public.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking lace that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nBerks County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOn-going improvements and maintenance to packaging and strorage areas, are some of the steps we take to improve safety at our facility. These improvements are on-going."
