The LPG is transferred to storage vessels via transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage vessel.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage vessels via loading stations.  Transfer if driven using fixed facility equipment for all transfer operations except those involving the truck stations in the north east of the facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency Contacts \n\nThere are two Crestwood employees who serve as the primary emergency contacts during off hours: the Terminal Supervisor and the Senior Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Adviser. Both employees can be reached 24 hours per day and are local to the facility. Emergency planning has started with the local fire department and Office of Emergency Management. An environmental cleanup company is under contract to provide additional assistance in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Plan \n\nThe written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees are involved in the overall risk management plan.
