A plant-wide evacuation drill for all employees is performed at least once per year.\n\n\n\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: ?888? emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, pagers, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the telephone tie lines with neighboring chemical plants, ?888? telephone activation system for communication with two adjacent facilities, Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon dialing 911, Rubicon can activate all or part of the community CAER emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CAER chemical facilities are located.  Rubicon can also activate the computerized Emergency Telephone Alerting System provided by the Community Alert Network (CAN) for Ascension Parish. In addition, the Emergency Broadcast System (television and/or radio) can be activated by dialing 911.  These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plant, the Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\n\n\n\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.  These authorities are Louisiana State Police, Ascension Parish Sheriff Department, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, Geismar Fire Department, Prairieville Fire Department, Red Cross, St. Elizabeth Hospital (Gonzales), Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital (Baton Rouge), Baton Rouge General "

The Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness has the ability to facilitate the activation of the National Guard Civil Support Team to respond to an on-site emergency.  GAMA also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Systems.  Rubicon performs annual training with most of these organizations or provides information necessary for coordinated emergency response.\n\n\n\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.  Rubicon also has emergency internal procedures that address Emergency Action and Crisis Management, Emergency Brigade, ?888? Emergency Notification Telephone System, Radiation Sources, Plant-wide Evacuation, Bomb Threats, and Hurricanes and Parking Area Emergency Notification System.  Preplanned emergency responses are practiced and are used during release drill scenarios.  Other response practices include utilizing wind socks to determine wind direction, the ?SAFER? System for air dispersion modeling of a toxic gas release, sampling on-site and off-site by HAZMAT response personnel, the phosgene detection monitoring system in occupied buildings, water deluge systems for fire and toxic air release suppression, equipment and operating unit shutdown systems and waste handling procedures.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRubicon?s current philosophy on major safety improvements is to evaluate the use of pipelines in place of tank trucks or rail cars for transportation of chemicals. Utilizing  pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals due to less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less vehicular transportation of these chemicals through their neighb"
