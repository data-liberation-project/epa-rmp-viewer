The site is owned by The Mosaic Company, but the ammonium sulfate fertilizer and soil nutrient manufacturing process is operated by Anuvia Plant City LLC per an agreement dated September 2019.  Anuvia will start up operations in August of 2020.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n \n\nThe Plant City facility maintains an extensive environmental, health and safety program that ensures compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal rules and regulations.\n\n \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n \n\nAt the Plant City facility only the operations related to the handling and consumption of anhydrous ammonia are subject to the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68), because the process exceeds the 10,000-pound threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia. The process meets the Program Level 3 risk management program requirements.\n\n \n\nThe RMP covered process includes the piping from the ammonia truck unloading area, five ammonia storage tanks, and all transfer piping/equipment from the storage tanks to the fertilizer manufacturing points. \n\n \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program of this facility is the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and the EPA Program 3 Prevention Program. The primary purpose of this facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program is to safeguard our employees and our neighbors from exposure to ammonia by evaluating and updating the facility's process and mechanical safety procedures and programs on a routine basis. This facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program was developed in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and with EPA's Risk Ma"

Equipment, instrumentation, procedures, and inspections are in place to enhance the accidental release program. These include: Emergency Shutdown system, ammonia detectors, ammonia excess flow valves, video surveillance, ammonia storage inspections, and instrumentation inspections and calibrations.\n\n \n\n Five Year Accident History\n\n \n\nAnuvia has not begun manufacturing operations thus, there have not been any accidents in the past 5 years that meet the reporting criteria in the risk management program rule.\n\n \n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed by Anuvia to protect human health and the environment in the event of an unintended release of hazardous materials, personal injury or property damage accidents, fire, natural events (Tornados, Hurricanes, Floods, etc.) and/or explosion. The plan and procedures are formalized to include an assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health and the environment, provide record keeping procedures, and describe the reporting of emergency incidents to regulatory agencies. \n\n \n\nThis ERP formalizes the arrangements with local police, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response personnel in case of an emergency event. The ERP also describes the actions that facility personnel must take to mitigate or respond to fires, or any unplanned, sudden, or non-sudden release of hazardous materials to air, soil, or surface water at the facility. A description of the available emergency equipment, training, evacuation and shelter in place procedures, and emergency shutdown procedures are also part of the ERP. \n\n \n\nA copy of the ERP is available to each employee and is intended to meet the mandates of the applicable regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over this facility.\n\n \n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\n \n\nChanges to improve safety "
