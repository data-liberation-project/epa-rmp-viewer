      "SummaryText": "CITY OF ASTORIA PUBLIC WORKS RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\tThe safe storage, handling and use of chlorine are important to the operations of the City of Astoria Public Works Department.  Procedures and policies have been in place for many years in order to safely utilize chlorine at Public Works facilities.  Public Works uses chlorine gas to provide disinfection for the City's drinking water and wastewater treatment processes.  There is one water supply facility and one wastewater facility that employ chlorine for this purpose.  At the Headworks, chlorine is injected into water mains as it leaves the facilities.  This ensures that any pathogens and bacteria will be inactivated prior to the water arriving at the customer's tap.  For the City's wastewater treatment operations, chlorine is injected at the last stage of treatment just prior to discharge of the wastewater effluent to the Columbia River.\n\n\tUnder the Environmental Protection Agency's worst case release scenario, data was entered into a computer based release model (RMP comp version 1.6 and 1.07.)  This was done for both facilities that Public Works Department operates.  This worst case release scenario, as generated by the model, would have 2,000 pounds of chlorine released over a ten-minute period of time.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point is 0.9 miles.  Under this scenario there is the potential for offsite impact to persons within this radius at both facilities.  Given the intensive inspection of containers upon delivery and many other safety procedures and physical layout of our facilities, a release of this magnitude would be extremely unlikely.  The containers are inspected by the chlorine vendor to industry standards, after which Public Works goes further with an even higher set of standards that each container must meet or it is rejected.  In addition, we have changed our chlorinator system to vacuum feed which, in cast of a piping leak, will automatically shut down the chor"

      "SummaryText": "ine feed at the container.  These systems have been installed at both facilities.  Prior to the new regulations, Public Works had begun a program to install vacuum chlorinator systems at all facilities.  These chlorinators provide an added safety margin in the event of a leak.  This retrofit program was implemented at the Wastewater Treatment Facility and the City Watershed/Headworks. \n\n\tUnder the Alternative Release Scenario, a more likely event was entered into the software model.  This event would simulate a leaking pipe connection from the container to the piping manifold.  This would have 0.5 pounds of chlorine leaking for one hour.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 mile.  This would have no offsite impact to persons within this radius at the Wastewater Treatment Facility but may at the Water Treatment Facility's residence.\n\n\tThe Astoria Public Works Department has several programs and policies that are designed to minimize the risk of a harmful accidental release.  One of the most important of these programs is the rigorous inspection, upon deliver, of the chlorine containers and cylinders.  Before they are unloaded from the delivery truck, each container is checked thoroughly for specific conformance with our standards.  We have regularly rejected shipments that were determined not to meet our standards for container integrity, valve cleanliness and function and tare weight labeling.  Another program that is extremely important is conducted annually on our chlorination equipment.  Critical parts are replaced, cleaned and/or calibrated to ensure proper feeding of the chlorine gas.  According to our records, over the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of measurable amounts of chlorine from Public Works facilities.\n\n\tIn the event of an emergency, personnel are trained to follow strict procedures that involve the participation of our local Fire Department.  We are fortunate to have within our Fire Department a Regional Haza"
