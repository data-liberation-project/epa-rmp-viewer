              "Description": "The city's prevention program is not currently mandated by OSHA regulations.  The safety program consists of a self-review and outside reviews by insurance company representatives.  The hazard review is a self-review that showed the major hazard was a toxic release caused by corrosion or equipment failure.  The chlorine storage area is enclosed on three sides which would mitigate any release.  There is currently no monitoring detection system.  Training is obtained on the job and by state regulatory agency seminars.  Competency is measured by demonstration and observation.  Equipment is regularly inspected, but no formal written procedures are currently used.  A complete review of the prevention program by an outside independent consultant is currently planned.",

The potential offsite consequences encompass a 2.2 mile radius that includes the city of Lamar.  The city has had no chlorine releases or accidents in the last five (5) years.  The city has coordinated with the local fire department to provide emergency response and to assist the local police department and LEPC in providing public notification in the event of a chlorine gas release.  Mitigation measures include enclosures.  Additional employee and staff training for accidental release prevention is currently being planned."
