      "SummaryText": "The Hanson Cold Storage Co. - Hart Division facility located in Hart, Michigan is a cold storage warehouse that has a closed loop refrigeration system containing ammonia. The primary purpose of this warehouse is to store products for various companies at either subzero temperatures or at A?refrigeratorA? temperature to preserve and / or extend the life of the product.\n\nAmmonia is used at the warehouse to refrigerate rooms to maintain a correct temperature as required by the customer.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the warehouse refrigeration system, providing the means to maintain specified temperature and / or remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the warehouse and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from rooms within the warehouse.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this warehouse.  \n\nThe warehouse was constructed using codes and standards existing at the time and is in compliance with state codes.  This cold storage warehouse complies with OSHAA?s Process Safety Management and EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe warehouse ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training, Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA), a nationally recognized authority in ammonia refrigeration, and contractor explanation and training (contractors are members of IIAR).  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and employee"

      "SummaryText": " training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.    Employees are initially trained and have refresher training in the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system at least every three years.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is computer operated with on-site and remote access for control of the system.  If an alarm should occur, and auto paging system contacts the operator.  An ammonia detection system is in place which alarms if ammonia is sensed and is linked to control the compressor room ventilation fan system and shuts down the refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system is also protected by specific safety systems/hardware and safety cutouts including pressure, temperature and level control.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, and vessels from the hazards associated with overpressure.  \n\nThe process has numerous safe guards including:  \nA?  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \nA?  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \nA?  The warehouse has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \nA?  A process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in 2009.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \nA?  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  "

      "SummaryText": "The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \nA?  For warehouse projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \nA?  Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \nA?  The warehouse has a program for replacement of all pressure relief valves every five years.\n \nThe warehouse has an emergency response program based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this warehouse.  The emergency response plan includes in-house response capabilities in the event of a release, procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. Staff will be assisted by the local response team comprised of representatives from other industries.  The warehouse emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements and responders are trained as required.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with agencies involved with a response. \n\nThe warehouse has had no reportable release in the past five year history."
