This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.                                                                                       \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Burnside Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Ascension Parish, Louisiana.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are used at the site.                                                                 \r\n\r\nThe Burnside Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, DuPont identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses two regulated substances, sulfur trioxide and oleum, in the sulfuric acid process (Process 1). In addition,a railcar containing sulfur trioxide may rarely be stored on site for a short time (without active shipping papers - Process 2).  \r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  In addition, DuPont is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified"

Therefore, the sulfuric acid process and railcar storage are classified as Program 3 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Releases\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances\r\n\r\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of a flammable substance is 1 psi overpressure (i.e. 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions. DuPont Burnside Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, DuPont does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Burnside Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the contents of the oleum tank and a sulfur trioxide railcar with no mitigation, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the OCA Guidance Document.   Railcars are typically shipped out as soon as they are loaded. \r\n\r\nAlternative Releases\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fenceline.  The conditions considered for alternative release scenarios were that the release rate is dependent upon the scenario and active and passive mitigation systems are in place.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nA hypothetical release scenario has been identified for the regulated toxic substances, oleum and sulfur trioxide in the sulfuric acid process. For sulfur trioxide, it was assumed that a 4-inch pipe would break outside of the containment building where"

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Burnside Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in  safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the sulfuric acid process area, Burnside has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) in a Standard Operating Conditions Manual.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nBurnside primarily uses the hazard and operability What if technique to perform thes evaluations.  What if analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  These What If Checklists are used by team members with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering experience.  The Team evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.
