      "SummaryText": "City of King\nKing, North Carolina\n\nExecutive Summary - 2007\n\nSince the startup of operations, the City of King Water Treatment Plant has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine and other chemicals at water treatment plant located in Tobaccoville, North Carolina. No reportable chlorine releases have occurred in the plant?s history. \n\nThe plant has been subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard since 1992. The plant operators have been achieving compliance with key activities such as standard operating procedures, two man teams for cylinder changes and a preventative maintenance program. In 1987, the site upgraded to a full vacuum system to deliver chlorine. This change eliminated a pressure regulator and pressure section of piping reducing the risk of a chorine release. \n\nIn early 2007, the City of King needed to increase chlorine inventories above the threshold (2,500 pounds) for compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP). The additional requirements for RMP such as the Offsite Consequences were addressed and are documented in this submission.           \n\nAs a result of the full vacuum system, our outstanding history with safe chlorine management and the strong plant staff, we feel confident that the City of King Water Treatment Plant will continue with safe chlorine operations.  \n\nReport by: \n\nScott Barrow, City Engineer\n                                                               \n\nFebruary 12, 2007"
