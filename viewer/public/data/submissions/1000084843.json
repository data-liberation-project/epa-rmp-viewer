The Butane addition was added to the Terminal in 2019. The facility was built to store and transport butane (RMP regulated substance), and refined products. The butane is delivered to the terminal via trucks while the refined products are delivered, via a pipeline from the Marathon Mandan, ND. and BPs Whittling, IN. Refineries. The 1,113,075 lbs. of butane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of two, pressurized bullet tanks.
