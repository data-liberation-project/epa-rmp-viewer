Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe regulated RMP substance handled at this facility is butane.  The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this site is 1,749,600 lb.  PFTC operates as a bulk liquid storage and transfer facility/terminal for hire (SIC Code #4226) to handle various liquids (RMP and non-RMP) owned by its customers.  It receives butane by tank truck or rail car into bullet tanks located on site.  \n\n\n\nAfter receipt, the butane is injected as needed into gasoline tanks also located on the site of PFTC to enhance the octane (RVP) of the gasoline on behalf of the gasoline liquid owning customers that have hired PFTC to store and transfer gasoline at the site for a fee.\n\n\n\nGiven the flammable nature of butane and other liquids on site, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure at the site, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  In this regard, safety at the company's facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as ensuring safety device integrity is incorporated into the design of the butane tanks and their ancillary equipment.   Furthermore, comprehensive training received by site employees upon hiring adds to the inherent safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nPFTC's emergency response program was developed in 1994 by an outside consulting firm and is updated every 5 years.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release were to occur, the company operates in compliance with NFPA Code 30 (Fire Code for tank farms) and NFPA-58 (LPG gas code) in liaison with the local Fire Department which helps to provide ensure trained emergency response personnel are knowledgeable on how to control and mitigat"

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAs stated above, the site receives, stores, and transfers butane for blending with gasoline for RVP and octane enhancement.  Butane arrives at the site via tank truck and is stored in twelve (12) 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  This site has unloading ports including hose and pipe connection points.  The transport modes being off-loaded with the assistance of a terminal operator employee as needed. Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, carriers, and contractors and to DHS TWIC Card holders at each company facility that receives liquids by water. \n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case release and alternate release scenarios were developed using RMPComp software.  In this regard, the following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for butane involves a catastrophic release from butane storage resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 145,800 lb. of butane from a single 30,000 gallon tank.   It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor that finds an ignition source. Assuming a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an air temperature of 77 F, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles was obtained corresponding to a flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\n\n\nAn alternative butane release scenario resulting in a Vapor Cloud Fire that involves a release six inch hole in the liquid space of a tank. In this scenario, 10,300 lb. of butane is released in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include positive shutoff valves, excess flow valves, back flow check valves, and an emergency shutoff valve with mechanical, thermal, and remote capability.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention risk management requirements set out under 40 CFR 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA Code 30 and NFPA-58 and other applicable design codes in effect at the time of installation.  \n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at the company's site:\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nPFTC maintains a detailed record of written safety information, which describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all aspects of the company's bulk liquid terminal. \n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\n\n\nA process hazard analysis was performed at each facility and is reviewed every three years.  The reviews or periodic audits focus with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are revalidated at a on operating procedures, equipment functions and handling practices to identify possible hazards including employee participation, contractor safety, hot work permitting, and management of change.   The audits are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel regular interval of three years per 40 CFR 68.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the company's covered operations, the site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the operations.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nPF"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision for three months or until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis by experienced company personnel. \n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nPFTC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on butane and propane equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified contractors certified for such work. Furthermore, facility personnel as well as contractors are offered any specialized training that may be needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nAs stated, PFTC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rules that are implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nPFTC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of butane.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe PFTC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to the company's stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period. \n\n\n\n6.
