Anhydrous ammonia is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream \nand related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately \n23,100 pounds (i.e., 4,300 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states \n(gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the control \npressure receiver that operates at approximately 100 pounds per square \ninch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 8,700 pounds of liquid \nammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 4,900 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, \nmake-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \npiping, and equipment.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nIce Cream Specialties, Inc. operates two separate ammonia systems, \nreferred to as the North and South systems.  The North ammonia \nrefrigeration system is a two-stage system.  The high-pressure receiver \nsupplies high-pressure (130 to 170 psig) liquid ammonia to the production \nfreezer units and the freezer warehouse.\n\nLiqu"

Liquid \nammonia from the low-pressure receiver is recirculated to the freezer \nunits.  Ammonia vapor from the low-pressure receiver feeds three booster \ncompressors, which compress the vapor and discharge into the \nintercooler.  Vapor from the intercooler is supplied to three high-stage \ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas) is vented to two evaporative condensers.  The condensed liquid is \nreturned to the high-pressure receiver.\n\nThe South ammonia refrigeration system is also a two-stage system.  Two \nhigh-pressure receivers supply high-pressure liquid ammonia to the \ncontrol pressure receiver.  The control pressure receiver regulates system \npressure and supplies high-pressure liquid ammonia at 100 psig to several \nprocess units including: storage tanks #1-14, glycol chiller, freezers #1-5, \nprocess room air units, HVAC coil, and plate chiller.\n\nLiquid/vapor ammonia from the above referenced South system units is \nreturned to one of four low-pressure receivers where the liquid and vapor \nseparate.  In addition, the low-pressure receivers supply liquid ammonia \nto the blast cell air units (30 psig) and Gram freezers #1 and 2 (50 psig). \nLiquid ammonia from the low-pressure receivers is recirculated to the \nprocess units.  Ammonia vapor from the low-pressure receivers feeds six \nbooster compressors, which compress the vapor and discharge into the \nintercooler.  Vapor from the intercooler is supplied to nine high-stage \ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas), at 130 to 170 psig, is vented to three evaporative condensers.

Safety interlocks include high-\npressure and high-temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \nwell as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high-pressure \ncutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases \nof ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from \nleaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent \nreleases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact \nemployees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or \nrepresent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined \nrelease scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were \nanalyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the \nammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  \nThis endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below \nwhich nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without \nexperiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could \nimpair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in \nthe USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration \n(the \"Model Plan\"), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used \nthe SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct \"lookup\" \ntables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the \nendpoint distance.\n\n2.1    WORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic \nrupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the control \npressure receiver (approximately 8,700 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-\nminute period.

Design, construction, and \noperation of the control pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure \nis extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict \naccordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) \nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and \nstamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National \nBoard).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's \ncondition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector \nwho has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is \ninspected twice daily by plant maintenance personnel, trained in the \noperation of the system.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment \nof the control pressure receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase \nuncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside or (2) rupture of the \nvessel wall due to inadvertent contact and damage from the outside.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum \nallowable working pressure) of 250 psig and because of the safety factors \nbuilt into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately \n1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  Such \npressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external \ncause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation \nfrom a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the \nvessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal \npressure at 250 psig.
