Under normal conditions the liquid transfer unit and transfer pumps can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the recirculators (west system), suction accumulator, or intercooler (east system), and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers.

The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers/thermosyphon vessel. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser.

The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Final Mile Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contain a total charge of approximately 54,000 LBS. It is extremely important that each process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.
