The facility is subject to the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Plan rule in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  The WWTP treats municipal and industrial wastes prior to disposal to Higgens Branch.\r\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible citizen very seriously.  Glasgow Water Company facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  Glasgow Water Company's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent incidents, including the release of hazardous materials, and to train employees in prevention of incidents.\r\nGlasgow Water Company has developed and implemented Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operations facility as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves the superintendents at each facility along with the plant operators.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe WWTP has developed a PSM plan as part of the overall chemical management program.  The program involves the superintendent and all operators at the facility.  WWTP personnel also provide safety training to staff as part of the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nDescription of Facility and the Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Glasgow WWTP is located at 705 Glen Garry Road in Glasgow, Kentucky, just south of the Glasgow Regional Landfill.  This facility began operation in 1960.  The WWTP's chlorination and dechlorination processes are covered by the EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates a water treatment plant (WTP) with a maximum capacity of four million gallons per day (MGD). After treatment, the waste water is discharged to Higgens Branch.  \r\n\r\nChlorine gas is i"
