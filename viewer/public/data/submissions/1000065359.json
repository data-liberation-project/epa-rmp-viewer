The Hazardous and \n\nOperability Study (HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the \n\nprocess.  The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, \n\ncontrol logics, and process operations.  Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The \n\nHAZOP analysis was conducted on January 20-21, 2016 and a pre-startup safety review was \n\nconducted on June 28, 2017.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting \n\nactivities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phase including \n\ninitial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \n\nemergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. The information \n\nis readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the \n\ninformation is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nTraining - TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel \n\ninvolved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation \n\nand maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.
