We have one substance that is above the threshold quanity as specified in Section 68.130 or 40 CFR Part 68 and therefore must comply with the RMP Program.This Program provides our facility with an integrated approach to identify and manage the hazards posed by regulated substances.Under this program,our facility has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.The goal of the Galax WTP is to work closely with the Local Emengency Planning Comm. & the Galax Fire Dept. to lessen any impact a release could have.The eligability criteria for Program 2 is as follows:"
