Facility Policy.\r\n       \r\n        The owners, management, and employees of Monke Bros. Fertilizer, Rollands Location, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, the Washington County LEPC, and any other necessary authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n \r\n2.     Facility information.\r\n      \r\n        The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers as a fertilizer. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.\r\n\r\n        The maximum quantity stored would be 210,000 pounds in a number of tanks.  These would include our storage tank and our nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the loss of ammonia from the storage tank holding approximately 77,000 pounds, and we will use this quantity as our worst case scenario.\r\n\r\n3.     Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\r\n\r\na.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 77,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 3.2 miles.\r\n\r\nb.    The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, would be the rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose.  Ammonia is released for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or a remote manual shut-off valve is closed and stops the"
