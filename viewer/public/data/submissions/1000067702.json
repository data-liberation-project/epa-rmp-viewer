Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer\n\nproduct, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient\n\nfor crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case\n\naccidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk\n\nManagement Program.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our\n\nstate regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP\n\nRegistration Form; see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,\n\nhas THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations,\n\nproperty damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordan"
