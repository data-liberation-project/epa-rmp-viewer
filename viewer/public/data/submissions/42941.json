      "SummaryText": "The Lemm Corporation (Lemm) operates an ammonia terminal, T/A Terminals, Inc. (T/A Terminals), Meredosia, Illinois.  The terminal stores anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold Quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  Lemm has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  Lemm has also implemented a RMP to document how response to a release at T/A Terminals conducted and information provided to the emergency response agencies.\n\nThe terminal is designed to receive agricultural grade ammonia either by truck, barge or rail, and store it at -28 F; it is also designed to transfer ammonia by truck, rail, pipeline, or barge.\n  \nThe ammonia stored is used primarily as an agricultural nitrogen fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by refrigerated barge through a pipeline from a riverport dock to the terminal, by pressurized rail containers and may be received by pressurized truck containers.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of 36,000 tons is contained in two (2) low temperature, low pressure storage tanks; a 20,000-ton and a 16,000-ton tank.\n\nThe worst-case release and the alternate release scenarios are delineated below.  EPA's RMP*Comp? was used in the consequence analyses.\n\nWorst Case\nChemical and Amount Released:  40,000,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia  in 10 minutes. \nWeather Conditions:  77 F with a 3.4 mph wind in Class F atmospheric stability.\n\nThis release would impact the urban area around T/A Terminals within a 25 mile radius and affect 63,000 residents, schools, hospitals, prison/correction facilit"

The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the T/A Terminals facility in good operation.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases at T/A Terminials during the last five (5) years.\n\nThe most recent equipment inspection was May 2004 of the facility instrumentation.\n\nShould there be an ammonia release, the Meredosia, Illnois Fire Department (MFD) will respond.  Should the need for an evacuation occur, the Meredosia, Illinois Police Department and neighboring  law enforcement agencies and will notify all households up to a 25 mile radius.  \n\nAnnual in-house employee training programs maintain and continually improve safety at T/A Terminals."
