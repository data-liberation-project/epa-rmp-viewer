These substances are used in various processes throughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  Substances that are used by Polychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part 68 are as follows:\n\nToxic Substances:\n\nFormaldehyde: Formaldehyde is received and stored as a 37 percent solution in water.  The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 56,000 pounds (21,000 pounds pure formaldehyde).\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\nDimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored as a 60 percent solution in water.  The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is 57,000 pounds (37,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\n         \n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical specific prevention steps have been developed. The key parts to the program are:  \n\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\n          Management System Responsibilities\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating\n          Recordkeeping Requirements\n          Communication and Coordination of Risk Management Information\n     DOT Hazardous Material Training\n     Contractor Performance Selection Process\n     Operating Procedures\n     Emergency Procedures\n     New Employee Environmental Health and Safety Orientation Training Program\n     Process Safety Program Auditing\n     24-hour Emergency Communications\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements for the chemicals formaldehyde and dimethylamine such as:"

The ERP has historically been coordinated with the City of Wayne LEPC and the local emergency dispatcher (i.e., 911).\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, one accident occurred at the facility related to a release of a covered RMP chemical.  In December 2003, a release of dimethylamine was precipitated by an equipment failure and subsequent mechanical activity.  The release was contained within the building and resulted in one, onsite injury to an employee requiring medical attention.  As a result of the accident, equipment was improved, training provided, and the ERP updated.\n\n\nSafety Improvement:\n\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Polychemie plans to periodically review the policies, procedures, and activities associated with the RMP as required by the regulations."
