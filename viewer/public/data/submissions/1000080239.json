OSI recently conducted an audit of their Process Safety Management Program and has dutifully implemented the recommendations from that audit. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for OSI. In addition to the facility EAP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the DuPage County Local Emergency Planning Committee. \r\n\r\nXI.\tManagement Program\r\nOSI has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals need to be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.
