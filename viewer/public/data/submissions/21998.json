(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Russellville, SC.  The facility is located on Georgia-Pacific Drive and is adjacent to two other Georgia-Pacific Corporation plants.  The resin facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1972 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins.  This formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1976.  Overall, the facility employs 65 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Russellville, South Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Russellville Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Russellville Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Russellville Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Russellville Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n? a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n? a prevention program to help maintain and safely"

In fact, the Russellville Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Con?t)\n\nGPRI limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Russellville Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Russellville Plant, GPRI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGPRI prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Russellville Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGPRI limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GPRI trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GPRI works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Russellville Plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which ar"

This RM Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the Russellville Plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGPRI is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  GPRI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Russellville Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Russellville Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GPRI provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GPRI established a management system headed by the RMP Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Con?t)\n\n1.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe Russellville Plant handles several regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n Regulated Substance    Process    Process Quantity*, lbs    RMP Threshold, lbs*\n            \nFormaldehyde Solution (50%)    Resin Manufacturing    88,717    15,000\nFormaldehyde Solution (50%)    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks    130,000    15,000\nAqueous Ammonia (28%)    Storage in Unpressurized Tanks    60,300    20,000\n* Process and threshold quantity is the quantity of ?pure? chemical, not of the solution\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Russellville Pl"

      "SummaryText": "ant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a ?worst case release scenario? and an ?alternative release scenario?.  GPRI does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Russellville Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n? one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n? one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n\n\n\n1.
