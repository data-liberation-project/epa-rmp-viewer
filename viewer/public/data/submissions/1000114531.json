Compliance audits for the anhydrous ammonia system are performed by a team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the anhydrous ammonia system and an audit leader knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program, CalARP Program, and PSM requirements and audit techniques. The compliance audit consists of separating the PSM program into its elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.\nIncident Investigation\nFollowing an incident that resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia (i.e., a near miss), APP staff will initiate incident investigation procedures and ensure that any resulting corrective actions are addressed and documented. The investigation team will prepare a report within 12 months of the incident summarizing the incident, including emergency actions taken, and corrective action schedule.\n\nES.7\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA number of studies and inspections have been conducted to improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia system at the APP, including the initial PHA conducted on March 24, 2009, and the PHA revalidations conducted on December 20, 2011, July 31, 2014, May 8, 2017, and May 10, 2023.

These procedures apply to vendor's drivers delivering acutely hazardous materials, such as anhydrous ammonia, to the plant. The contractor safety requirements do not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety, such as janitorial work, food and drink services, laundry, delivery, or other supply services. The APP holds contractor safety briefings before allowing the contractor to perform work on or adjacent to the anhydrous ammonia system. These safety briefings inform contractors of the hazards, access limitations, safe work practices, and emergency response procedures associated with the anhydrous ammonia system. \nPre-Startup Safety Review\nThe APP has procedures in place to ensure that a pre-startup safety review is conducted prior to starting a new covered process or prior to making modifications to the anhydrous ammonia system that require implementation of the management of change (MOC) procedures. These procedures ensure that no new or significantly modified process will startup and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. \nMechanical Integrity\nThe APP implements the mechanical integrity program to ensure the continued integrity of the equipment in the anhydrous ammonia system. An effective mechanical integrity program addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventive maintenance schedules, and personnel training. Preventive maintenance records are maintained on file electronically for review as needed.\nHot Work Permits\nThe APP requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.

The safety information includes safety data sheets, a process description, maximum intended inventory, safe operating limits, equipment specifications, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the system.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe APP conducts process hazard analyses (PHAs) to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. A PHA identifies the process hazards, findings from previous incident investigations, opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors, safeguards used to control hazards, and steps used to detect or monitor releases. Each PHA will be revalidated or updated at least once every five years.\nOperating Procedures\nThe APP maintains up-to-date, accurate, and written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for the anhydrous ammonia system. Operating procedures are required for all stages of system operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following emergency shutdown.\nTraining\nAPP employees presently involved in supervising, operating, or maintaining the anhydrous ammonia system at the APP must be trained in an overview of the process and applicable operating and maintenance procedures.

The Emergency Action Plan details the response procedures, protective measures, levels of training, regulatory notification requirements, and post-incident investigation procedures. The Emergency Action Plan also identifies emergency assembly areas, evacuation routes, and related procedures to be undertaken during emergency scenarios.\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release, the highest ranking operations person must be notified immediately. If the release is incidental, trained APP personnel will perform the tasks necessary to accomplish containment and mitigation of the release. If the release is uncontrollable, the Control Room Operator will notify the Fire Department. The Fire Department will handle spill/release response and mitigation. \nAlthough not a requirement of Risk Management Program regulations, it is recommended that Emergency Action Plan drills be performed at least annually.

The APP is a simple-cycle facility that is integrated into TID's plans to meet its growing native load, and provide other ancillary services and benefits to TID.\nThe APP generating facility consists of one natural-gas-fired General Electric (GE) LM-6000PC CTG and three natural-gas-fired GE LM-6000PG CTGs. Unit 1 is equipped with steam injection for emissions reduction, one HRSG, and a deaerating tank. Units 2, 3, and 4 are equipped with water injection for emissions reduction. All four CTGs share the existing 2-cell mechanical-draft cooling tower and associated support equipment, providing a total nominal generating capacity of 213-MW (at average annual ambient conditions). \nThe APP stores anhydrous ammonia in a 12,000-gallon storage tank, which contains a mixture of liquid and vaporized ammonia under pressure. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at a given time is 52,428 pounds. This quantity exceeds the Risk Management Program threshold quantity (10,000 pounds), CalARP Program threshold quantity (500 pounds), and PSM threshold quantity (10,000 pounds); therefore, the APP's anhydrous ammonia system is subject to the Risk Management Program, CalARP Program, and PSM regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system at APP qualifies for Program 3.\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the APP in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to reduce emissions of NOX from the combustion of natural gas. Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank, diluted with air at the ammonia injection skids, and injected into a distribution grid inside the CTG exhaust duct, upstream of the SCR unit. The SCR unit consists of a catalyst bed, which allows the ammonia vapor and NOX to combine and form nitrogen and steam or water vapor, thereby reducing NOX emissions.

The APP stores and uses anhydrous ammonia to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOX), which are created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the four combustion turbine generators (CTGs) and one heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). Using and storing anhydrous ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. APP personnel take their safety obligations very seriously and ensure that operators involved in the use of anhydrous ammonia are trained and knowledgeable in the chemical hazards associated with their jobs. The following Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, some of the steps taken to ensure a safely operating power plant, and how chemical emergencies are handled. \nThis RMP complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under Title 19 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Division 5, Chapter 2. This RMP, specifically Section 3, also complies with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, which was adopted by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) under 8 CCR 5189 in 1992. Attached to this section is a copy of the electronic submittal of the RMP to the EPA.\n\nES.2\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe APP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.
