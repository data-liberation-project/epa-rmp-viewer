This commitment is demonstrated by the site's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is the site's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. However, if a release were to occur, employees are trained in emergency response to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  In addition, the emergency response plan is coordinated with Gales Ferry, CT Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe facility's primary activities encompass SB (Styrene Butadiene) Latex manufacturing.  There are 2 regulated substances present at the Allyn's Point facility.  These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, and Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymer. Previously the facility had a Magnum operating unit which used Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] for the production of ABS (Acrylonitrile, Butadiene, Styrene) plastic. This facility was closed in 2008.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe Allyn's Point facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good design practices and engineering standards.  Elements of the release prevention program that are in place include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, tra"

Due to stringent release prevention policies, the plant has not had any accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances during this period.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nStyron LLC, Allyn's Point Plant has a written emergency response plan to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nLedyard LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no planned changes at this time. Styron LLC has performed a security vulnerability analysis. This study has increased the site's perimeter fencing and the number of cameras to improve the overall monitoring of the site's activities."
