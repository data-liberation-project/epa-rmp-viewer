      "SummaryText": "Wolf Hollow II, owned and operated by Wolf Hollow II Power, LLC, located at 8787 Wolf Hollow Ct. in Granbury, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  Steam is produced using heat from combustion turbine exhaust gases and used to load a steam power generator. Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Wolf Hollow II because the plant handles and stores aqueous ammonia in excess of threshold quantities. Aqueous ammonia, at concentrations less than 44%, is not on the OSHA PSM list. Therefore, Wolf Hollow II is subject to RMP Program 2 requirements. There are no other toxic or flammable substances onsite that exceed RMP thresholds.  \n\nAqueous ammonia is injected into the combustion turbine exhaust stream as a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired combustion. The aqueous ammonia is stored on-site in storage tanks. Wolf Hollow II maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that the process hazards associated with the emissions control system are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner. The documents include information concerning the hazards of ammonia process technology and process equipment. This information is updated when changes in the process occur. Wolf Hollow II does not have any incidents to date, for recording in an accidents history. Wolf Hollow II maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP outlines the method Wolf Hollow II uses to safely evacuate the site, if necessary, and the preferred means to notify outside emergency response agencies. \n\n\n\n \n\n"
