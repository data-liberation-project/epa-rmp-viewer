Viskase utilizes the regulated chemical carbon disulfide in the cellulose food casing process.  Viskase's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Viskase's installation of  the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring detection systems.  Viskase adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:\n\nA worst-case scenario analysis was conducted for the carbon disulfide process at Viskase utilizing requirements contained in EPA guidelines.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as, \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\"  The release is assumed to occur instantaneously.  Administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance in a vessel or pipe can be considered when determining the worst-case scenario.  The possible causes of the release or the probability that such a release might occur is not considered in the worst-case scenario analysis; the release is simply assumed to take place.  \n\nFor toxic liquids, such as carbon disulfide, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to spill onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  Only passive mitigation systems may be taken into account for the worst-case consequence analysis.  The total quantity spilled is assumed to spread instantaneously to a depth of 0.39-inch (1 centimeter) in an undiked area or the spill will cover a diked area"

      "SummaryText": "instantaneously.  The release rate to air is estimated as the rate of evaporation from the liquid pool.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for carbon disulfide is 0.16 mg/L.  This airborne concentration has been published by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) and is the maximum airborne concentration below which is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nMeteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined by EPA Guidance as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour), and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C. Topography for the worst-case scenario is either rural or urban.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR CARBON DISULFIDE - TOXIC SUBSTANCE\n\nThe analysis conducted by Viskase Corporation identified the worst-case carbon disulfide release as the carbon disulfide railcar splitting open while spotted on site. Due to the conditions required by EPA, it is assumed that the entire contents of the railcar will release instantaneously.  Containment walls or \"splash walls\" are located around the railcar, with the exception at the ends of the railcar, that direct any release or spill into the containment that is located directly under the railcar.  The ends of the railcar are protected by splash baffles in the containment basin.  The containment, which contains four (4) inches of water, will hold the entire contents of the railcar.\n \nViskase calculated that 99% of the total volume released from the railcar would flow into the containment beneath the railcar.  One percent (1%) is assumed to \"splash\" onto the ground surrounding the railcar due to the wave action if the railcar were to rupture instantaneously.  The total amount that could be released from the railcar is 105,100 pounds.  Therefore, one percent (1%) of"

      "SummaryText": "the release would be 13.53 ft3.  A spill of carbon disulfide from the railcar would: 1) flow into the containment underneath the railcar, and 2) splash from the containment area onto the ground around the railcar.  Carbon disulfide is heavier than water, therefore, the carbon disulfide that flows into the containment would sink beneath the water level which would act as blanket and will eliminate the carbon disulfide from evaporating to the air.  Therefore, only the surface area of the amount \"splashed\" as a result of the release (13.53 ft3) is used to calculate the evaporation rate and the duration of the release.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of the release is based upon the evaporation rate and duration of the release from the amount that splashed.\n\nA wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F was used in calculating the worst-case scenario per Risk Management Guidance, and the topography of the area surrounding the property is urban. \n\nUsing these parameters it was determined (using EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance tables) that with a carbon disulfide release of 13.53 ft3, an estimated distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.16 mg/L is 0.87 miles.\n\nThis worst-case scenario does not take into account Viskase's active mitigation measures that are in place for the carbon disulfide system, and or materials of construction of the railcar, that would make a release of this type improbable.  The railcar unloading location is equipped with a deluge system that is triggered manually or by heat sensors that will protect against vapor ignition.  In addition, Viskase's operating procedures require constant monitoring of the railcar during unloading activities, which improves emergency response time. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nEPA requires that an alternative scenario be analyzed for each regulated toxic chemical present above the threshold quantities. The release scenario must include consideration of the following:\n\n1. Tran"

The amount of piping, which is two inch (2\") Schedule 10 stainless steel, from the backflow valve to the break or site of the release is approximately 500 feet.  The carbon disulfide (CS2) process pump is equipped with CS2 sensors, which detect CS2 in the exhaust gas at the pump.  When this sensor is triggered, an audible alarm is sounded.  Viskase carbon disulfide operators can manually stop the pump from the control panel; but if operators fail to manually shut the pump off, the pump automatically stops operating after two minutes even during normal operations.  Therefore, in the event of a leak or break at the flange in the piping at the beginning of the pump cycle, the pump would continue to operate for 2 minutes.  Therefore, the total amount of CS2 that would be released is the amount released from the pump operating for 2 minutes and the amount released from the piping from the backflow valve to the break.  A release of carbon disulfide at this area would flow onto a concrete pad beneath the flange, which then directs the flow of carbon disulfide into the railcar containment area.  Fifty percent (50%) or more of the total release would flow into the containment basin underneath the railcar unloading area due to the grade and flow pattern of the concrete pad on which the release would occur.  \n\nMeteorological conditions for the alternative release scenario is atmospheric stability class D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C and 50 percent humidity.
