GGE is a dry mill fuel-ethanol production facility located in Mason City, Cerro Gordo County, Iowa. This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\") Part 68 and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe GGE facility is subject to the RMP rule due to storage above threshold quantities of denaturant, a regulated flammable substance.  This is a 5-year Resubmittal completed in accordance with the regulations.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGGE is committed to operating the facility in a manner that promotes both the safety of our employees and the general public as well as being protective of the environment. GGE has adopted and implemented policies and procedures that ensure our operations adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the equipment and through the training of our personnel, GGE has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  In the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Integrated Contingency Plan (\"ICP\"). The ICP includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the ICP is used to familiarize local emer"

Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nGolden Grain Energy, LLC (GGE) owns and operates an ethanol production facility that is currently permitted to produce 150,000,000 gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a continuous fermentation and distillation process.  This stationary source is on approximately 200 acres of land in an agricultural area located on the southern edge of Mason City, Iowa. The facility is in operation 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year. Considered a single stationary source with NAICS code 325193 (Ethyl Alcohol Manufacturing), GGE is subject to Section 112(r) of Clean Air Act and has developed a risk management program due to on-site storage of natural gasoline (denaturant). Denaturant is a flammable mixture and, when it has an NFPA Rating of 4, is subject to RMP if greater than 10,000 pounds is stored on-site.  \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAs required by EPA, GGE has established programs to address accidental release prevention measures and notification requirements of Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  As a result of proximity to public receptors, GGE is not eligible for Program 1. Also, GGE is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. 29 CFR 1910.119. Therefore, GGE follows Program 3 requirements for the Risk Management Program. The fundamentals of GGE's Risk Management Program are met through the Process Safety Management (PSM) program that is active at GGE. GGE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of denaturant and other hazardous substances. In order to avoid risk associated with"

Employee Participation\nGGE has developed an employee participation program that ensures employees have access to all process safety information, results of any process hazard analysis (PHA), results of any incident investigation, results of any compliance audit, current operating procedures, current emergency response plan, and records of any management of change.\n\n3.2. Process Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nThe facility utilizes the HAZOP PHA methodology. The PHA identified potential major hazards, including toxic gas release, flammable liquid fire, vapor cloud explosion, storage vessel over-pressurization, equipment failure due to corrosion, release of hazardous materials due to over-filling and/or loss of containment.  The facility utilizes process controls such as vent collection systems, pressure and vacuum relief valves, in-line check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, automated interlocks, operating level alarms, operating procedures, grounding and bonding equipment, rupture disks, and excessive flow devices to prevent or limit releases.  GGE keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) and the Emergency Response Action Plan. The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and piping and instrument drawings (\"P&ID\").\n\n3.3.

Contractors\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that contractor personnel follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training, and safe work permitting that includes hot work and fire prevention.\n\n3.5. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\nGGE conducts a pre-startup safety review (\"PSSR\") for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service.\n\n3.6. Mechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems and controls in safe operating condition.\n\n3.7. Management of Change\nThe facility's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.\n\n3.8. Incident Investigation\nGGE has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a release of a regulated substance.

Compliance Audits\nThe facility will conduct audits of the provisions of RMP and PSM to verify that procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  The audit will include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nGGE has not experienced an accidental release from the denaturing process that resulted in 1) deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or 2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nGGE maintains a written emergency response program in its ICP that includes an Emergency Response Action Plan and the Facility Response Plan. The purpose of the ICP is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The ICP addresses aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, GGE has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures when first assigned to a job and on a recurring basis to ensure they can perform their specific emergency response duties.  In the event a release of denaturant occurs, GGE employees will provide initial response. If additional assistance is deemed necessary to minimize onsite impact, the Mason City Fire Department will be called."
