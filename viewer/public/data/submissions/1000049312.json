SemGroup management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Rose Valley Facility is owned and operated by SemGroup. At the facility, natural gas is received via pipeline and processed. The natural gas liquids recovered in the process are transported to market by pipeline. The dry gas is shipped from the site by pipeline. NGLs are the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Rose Valley facility in amounts above threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation since there are no receptors (residences or other occupied buildings) within the worst case scenario distance.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by SemGroup. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaini"

Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since the facility started operations. Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no RMP accidents in the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Dacoma Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Woods County Sheriff. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n\u00bf\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n\u00bf\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\r\n\u00bf\tThe Mechanical Integrity provis"
