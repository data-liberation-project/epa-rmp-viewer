At this facility, we store various food products which are later distributed to restaurants and other customers. Like most cold storage warehouses, we use Anhydrous Ammonia in our refrigeration system.                                                                                                                                  \n\nUS Foods Baltimore is commited to maintaining a safe manufacturing and food distribution environment. We are commited to  obeying local, state, and federal laws that apply to our business and ammonia system.

All contractors receive a Facility Orientation to the hazards of ammonia and emergency procedures. Those contractors that are working on the ammonia system or could impact the safety of the system receive additional training on the facility work practices and procedures.  \n\n(10) Hot Work pemits: At the facility we followed the Hot Work Permitting Process for all spark or flame producing operations. \n\n(11) Emergency Response: To ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the general public we have developed an emergency response plan.
