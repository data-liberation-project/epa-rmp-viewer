One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the WCF and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at WCF. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the WCF.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWCF has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and contractors and to the preservation of the environment. One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. WCF utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.\n\nIn the event of a release, as a non-responding facility, WCF personnel are instructed to dial 911 to notify the Woodhaven Fire Department via telephone to respond and to mitigate the release. WCF has coordinated emergency response to the facility with the Woodhaven Fire Department. In conjunction with the Wayne County local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the Woodhaven Fire Department has the ability to notify the local community through media broadc"

To help realize this policy, MPL has adopted the RC14001&reg; management system that adheres to a \"plan-do-check-adjust\" framework to assess risks, set targets and measure progress.  MPL's executive leadership team meets at least quarterly with key HES&S leaders throughout the company to evaluate performance and to discuss key strategic issues.  This forum, called the HES&S Management Committee, enables executive leadership to stay fully aware of pressing HES&S matters affecting the company and to ensure governance of the RC14001&reg; management system.\n\n1.2 WCF Regulated Substances\n\nWCF is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility with eight underground solution-mined storage caverns and five major above ground LPG storage vessels. The storage caverns are used to store flammable mixtures, specifically butane and propane, for use in MPL's Michigan Refining Division, Detroit Refinery, or for LPG truck sales. The flammable mixtures are covered under the RMP rule and are present at the WCF above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nWCF has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMPL performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.  Release scenarios can be used"

Because the process at the WCF that is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the WCF, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWCF encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of WCF's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at WCF. In addition, WCF has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include teams which promote both process and personal safety, such as the monthly Safety and Operations Meetings with management and hourly employees. Management groups typically have members with various areas of expertise, including operations, maintenance, and management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWCF keeps a variety of technical documents at the WCF that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters"

Specific WCF Operations personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, WCF has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the WCF Operations Manual. WCF ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nWCF also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nWCF has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, the covered process and any future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nWCF primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation.

A schedule is developed to address the PHA team's recommendations (Action Items) in a timely and prioritized manner. The final resolution and completion of each Action Item is documented and retained at the WCF by designated Operations personnel.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, WCF periodically updates and revalidates the Woodhaven Cavern Facility PHA. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWCF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

The written operating procedures are readily available to the on-duty WCF Operator and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operation, WCF has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the Woodhaven Cavern Facility. New employees receive orientation training, which includes, but is not limited to, the following topics: Process Overview, Employee Involvement, General Safety Rules, Safe Work Permit, Lockout/Tagout, Blinding and Line Breaking, and the Safe Handling of LPG. After successfully completing this training, a WCF Operator Trainee is paired with a qualified WCF Operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. Trainees spend time with all qualified WCF Operators before training is complete. After trainees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, the trainee's performance and knowledge are reviewed by qualified WCF Operators and a vote is taken to determine if he/she is qualified to operate the Woodhaven Cavern Facility.\n\nIn addition, all WCF Operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nWCF uses contractors at the WCF to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, WCF evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. WCF personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review\n\nWCF conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind). The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWCF has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. WCF incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nWCF has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined sp"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWCF promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to WCF management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
