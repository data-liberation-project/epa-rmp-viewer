Its most extensive use is in soil fertilization as a source of nitrogen, which is essential for plant growth. The Plant City Facility maintains an extensive environmental, health and safety program that ensures compliance with all applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations. In fact, the facility operates under a Corporate Policy that endorses going beyond regulatory requirements when prudent to enhance the protection of the health and safety of its employees and the public. The design, maintenance and operation of this facility are carried out in compliance with this program and policy in order to provide safe operations and to prevent exposure of our employees and our neighbors to ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe Plant City Facility Emergency Response Plan is based upon OSHA's hazardous waste operations and emergency response standard [29 CFR 1910.120(q)]. The plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. Additional response procedures include: Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) trained operating and supervisory personnel, emergency response drills with local emergency responders, ammonia sensors located at critical locations in the process area, continuous monitoring of ammonia sensor readings, continuous recording of weather conditions, and fog nozzles and other equipment for ammonia suppression.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Plant City Facility receives shipments of anhydrous ammonia by rail. The ammonia is transferred from the railcars to pressurized ammonia tanks. The ammonia is pumped from the tanks directly to the four granulation plants, where it is combined with phosphoric acid to produce ammonium p"

The primary purpose of this facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program is to safeguard our employees and our neighbors from exposure to ammonia by evaluating and updating the facility's process and mechanical safety procedures and programs on a routine basis. This facility's Accidental Release Prevention Program was developed in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and with EPA's Risk Management Regulation 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific prevention steps have been taken by this facility to minimize and mitigate potential releases.  Equipment, instrumentation, procedures, and inspections are in place to enhance the accidental release program.  These include:  Emergency Shutdown system, ammonia detectors, ammonia excess flow valves, video surveillance, ammonia storage inspections, and instrumentation inspections and calibrations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, there has been one ammonia release that met the RMP rule criteria for reporting.  The event resulted in onsite impacts only.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nHAZMAT training is performed in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 (g) and pre-emergency planning and drills have been conducted with outside responders.
