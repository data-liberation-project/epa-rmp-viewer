The process is functionally divided into three sections: Dehydration, Refrigeration, and Storage.  The main function of the facility is to extract liquid hydrocarbons and prepare produced gas for sales.  The process is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189.  The facility is currently in compliance with the written Process Safety Management Program.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety of the facility have been established based on the process safety management compliance audits every three years and revalidation of the process hazard analysis (PHA) every 5 years.  The last revalidation was February 1998.\n\nThe prevention program is based on this regulation, which includes the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor selection and review, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Start-Up Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  Mechanical Integrity includes ultrasonic testing of the vessel and pipe.\n\nCastle Peak Resources, LLC maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Yowlumne Gas Plant has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department and Certified Unified Program Agency.  \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, contact 9-1-1, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, and secure the area.   The 9-1-1 system is use"

      "SummaryText": "d to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by the reviewing records from the Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on the Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance equations model. This distance impacts public receptors of adjacent farms and a resident population of 15.  The worst case release is 105,463 lbs of liquefied petroleum gasoline liquids and indicates a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.38 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario for this process is a break in a transfer hose connection.  Although the facility operator and truck driver are in attendance during transfer operations, the scenario may result in a release of 60 lbs. over a 10 minute period.  The maximum distance for this scenario is 0.05 miles.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSeismic parameters were addressed by conducting a walkthrough of the covered process and reviewing the mechanical integrity records.  The Mechanical Integrity Program is based on industry standards, American Petroleum Institute Standard 570 Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: Maintenance Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration.  Ultrasonic testing of process lines and vessels are part of the continuous prevention program of the facility and is consistent with seismic assessment parameter."
