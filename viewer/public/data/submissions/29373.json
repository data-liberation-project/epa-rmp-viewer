This plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at Publix-Atlanta Bakery.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the Publix-Atlanta Bakery design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Publix-Atlanta Bakery has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n1.1. Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nPublix-Atlanta Bakery is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1. It is the policy of Publix-Atlanta Bakery to:\n\n1.1.1.1 Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2 Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3 Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n1.1.1.4 Ensure, through training, and when necessary dis"

Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3. This facilities aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4. Publix-Atlanta Bakery has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for facility. In addition, Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasure Plan, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, and a Process Safety Management Program have also been established.  It is the responsibility of the Facility's management to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5. The first duty of Publix-Atlanta Bakery employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2. Facility Description\n\nPublix-Atlanta Bakery is a pie baking facility located in Atlanta, Georgia. Previously the location was owned and operated by Country Home Bakery, Inc.. The facility is now responsible for preparing, baking and shipping Publix Supermarket products to various locations"

      "SummaryText": " throughout the surrounding states. The facility is situated on 7.22 acres at 5475 Bucknell Drive, SW, in the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia.  Approximately sixty (60) will be  employed at the facility.  \n\n1.2.1. The substances regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.2. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration System.\" Approximately 37,248 pounds of ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the facility.  \n\n1.3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n1.3.1. As required by the regulations, the worst-case release scenario involves a failure within the refrigeration system [potential vessel rupture (High Pressure Receiver)] that results in the total of 8,114 pounds of anhydrous ammonia being released in a 10-minute period.  No passive or active mitigation systems were considered for this scenario.  Using ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) the distance to the endpoint for such a release is 3.0 miles.  There are potential public receptor impacts regarding this scenario.\n\n1.3.2. The alternative release scenario involves the loss of anhydrous ammonia from one of the refrigeration system's ammonia containing vessels through a pressure relief valve.  Such a release would be vented through the pressure relief valve collection header.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release, based on ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) is 0.15 miles.  The potential public receptor impacts regarding this scenario would be limited to the immediate vicinity of the facility.\n\n1.4. Emergency Response Program\n\n1.4.1. Publix-Atlanta Bakery is equipped with an emergency warning system.  Alarms are strategically placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the acc"
