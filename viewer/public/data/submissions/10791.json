We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility takes propane off the Eastern Delivery System pipeline operated by Dome Pipeline Corporation, and stores it in various aboveground bullets, the largest being 103,000 gallons. Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the facility and is injected into the propane stream prior to truck and rail loading.   Due to the executive order staying propane coverage from the RMP regulation, ethyl mercaptan is our only covered substance.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a sub"

The tank contains a maximum of 87,550 gallons (85% storage capacity) of a butane/propane mixture.  The scenario was based on the remote possibility of the tank being compromised due to physical or mechanical damage.  The distance to 1 PSI overpressure has been calculated at .59 miles.  Based upon 1990 census data, US Geological Survey maps and aerial photography, Dome Pipeline Corporation has determined the following public receptors are within the .59 miles ( 52 residents, 17 homes and 2 commercial businesses).  No environmental receptors were found.  To eliminate potential fuel sources, the following control measures are: (1) the area near the storage tanks is rocked, (2) a vegitation control program is in place and (3) the facility is wired according to National Fire Protection Association Standard 70.
