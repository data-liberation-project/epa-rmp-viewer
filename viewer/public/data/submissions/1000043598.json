If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Mediapolis Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Des Moines County, IA LEPC will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the River Valley Cooperative is Doug Hollingsworth.

      "SummaryText": "LATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT RIVER VALLEY COOPERATIVE, SPERRY, IOWA:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of one (1) storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is eight (8).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program, the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The facility also has a nitrogen shut off system installed. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Tow"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with current applicable ANSI/CGA Standards and State law.\n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.  Finally, River Valley Cooperative has extended to the Mediapolis Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nRiver Valley Cooperative, Sperry, IA has not had an accident in the last five years in which the general public was involved and where anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering' in place. \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of River Valley Cooperative to immediately notify the Mediapolis Volunteer Fire Department and the Des Moines County, IA LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency.  In the unlikely event that the Mediapolis Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our location, the volunteer fire department with whom Mediapolis has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.
