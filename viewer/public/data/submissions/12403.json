      "SummaryText": "\nMaola Milk and Ice Cream is a manufacturer and distributor of milk, ice cream and juice products. The New Bern plant is the only production facility. Maola uses anhydrous ammonia as its primary refrigerant. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is just above the minimum threshold for reporting purposes (10,000lbs).  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables and Equations has been used to determine the offsite impact of an ammonia release. Maola has implemented administrative controls and procedures to greatly minimize the likelihood of an offsite impact.   \n\nMaola participates in the Craven County Office of Emergency Planning (LEPC).  A full-time safety coordinator is employed. Regular classroom and on-the-job training for anhydrous ammonia safe handling is conducted.  Maintenance personnel are trained and updated in emergency procedures dealing with (NH3) anhydrous ammonia.  Training includes how to use and  keep the self contained breathing apparatus and portable breathing devices in peak operating condition.  Emergency equipment relevent to ammonia is easily accessible. Maola stores safety equipment in three different areas of the plant. Two or more maintenance employees are on-site to help direct, and/or rectify any emergencies involving ammonia.\n\nRegular plant operating employees are trained to evacuate and assemble in designated areas.  It is standard to call key individuals who are off duty during an emergency.  A priority emergency list of names insures the right people will be notified.  Telephone numbers of local emergency response units are readily available.  Maintenance and operation personnel communicate through two-way radios on site. Key maintenance employees are assigned beeper numbers in case of emergencies.  \n\nAll employees are informed of the hazards of anhydrous ammonia through orientations and refresher safety meetings. Regular documented safety meetings ensure employees are familiar with the emergency procedures.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The local fire department periodically tours plant facilities and is available to assist in emergencies. Management is confident that they are able to control and rectify any situation that arises.\n\nMaola tests and critiques its Emergency Response Plan annually in accordance with 29CFR1910.120.  A plant safety steering committee addresses safety concerns in a fast and efficient manner.  Emergency situations are discussed and analyzed. If necessary, corrective procedures and additional training are promptly provided.  Maola is continually upgrading and improving its ammonia system to insure safe operations."
