A mechanical integrity program is in place to assure the continued integrity of ammonia equipment.  A maintenance schedule was compiled to track and log the process.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Work Permit is to control, in a consistent manner, non-routine work conducted in ammonia process areas. Specifically, this subparagraph is concerned with the permitting of hot work operations in process areas. Hot work permits for hot work operations, such as the ones associated with welding and cutting conducted on or near an ammonia process, will be in compliance with the fire prevention and protection requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a).\r\n\r\nManagement of Change is intended to require management of all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions concerning ammonia other than replacement in kind, by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation.\r\n\r\nAn incident investigation will be performed any time there is an incident which results in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near-miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia.

The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  For documenting purposes, the facility will report the maximum intended inventory as 27,870 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia. Refer to Process Safety Information section for related ammonia inventory calculations and information.\r\n\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nIn accordance with CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System.

In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release include a well-designed relief system, alarms and shutoffs, gas detection, and an adequate venting system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Boskovich Farms to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 27,870 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 500-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis [PHA]\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Training\r\n- Mechanical Integrity\r\n- Management of Change\r\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n- Compliance Audits\r\n- Incident Investigation\r\n- Employee Participation\r\n- Hot Work Permit\r\n- Contractors\r\n\r\nThe purpose of employee participation is improved safety for all employees.

      "SummaryText": "of performing a PHA is to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the process and to provide information to assist employers in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the chances of a catastrophic ammonia release. The PHA was performed by teams with expertise in engineering and process operations, knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used, and included employees with experience and knowledge specific to the processes being evaluated.\r\n\r\nThe intent of Operating Procedures is to provide clear instructions for conducting activities involved in handling ammonia that are consistent with the process safety information. The operating procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\r\n\r\nTraining has been developed to help employees understand the nature and causes of problems arising from ammonia operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to their hazards. An effective training procedure significantly reduces the number and severity of incidents arising from process operations, and can be instrumental in preventing small problems from leading to a catastrophic release. The training procedures include: Initial Training, Refresher Training, and Documentation.\r\n\r\nThe contractors screening process is designed to evaluate the desired job tasks involving ammonia without compromising the safety and health of employees at a facility. The contractor must assure that contract employees are trained on performing the job safely, on the hazards related to the job, and on applicable provisions of the emergency action plan.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) has been developed to make sure that, for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification necessitates a change to PSI, important considerations are addressed before ammonia introduced into the process; namely, the PSSR must confirm the following: construct"
