Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Stanislaus Farm Supply Company, Stanislaus Farm Supply Company facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 624 East Service Road, Modesto, CA, 95358-9451 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n7 The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The regulated pesticides are received, stored and distributed for direct application in pest control.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck or rail car and stored in 2 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 112,000 pounds.\n\n7 Anhydrous ammonia is loaded from the 2 stationary storage tanks into field application tanks that are stored at the site until they are transported to the user. There is a maximum of 93 application tanks at the site at any time during the year with the maximum total amount of anhydrous ammonia thus stored being 294,000 pounds.\n \n7 Aqua ammonia is received by tanker truck or mixed onsite and stored in 2 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 192,000 pounds.\n \n7 The maximum quanti"

Anhydrous Ammonia (Stationary Storage Tanks) - Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 56,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l is 2.8 miles. The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a 2\" diameter hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l) is 0.5 miles.\n\nb.  Anhydrous Ammonia (Field Application Tanks) - Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest field application tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l is 0.2 miles. The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a >\" diameter valve fitting.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l) is 0.1 miles.\n\n    c.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 150,000 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l) is 0.4 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a 3-inch line on a 90,000 pound storage tank.

The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is the release of 175 pounds of methyl bromide from a storage cylinder over a 1- hour period.

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n\n\nRegulated Pesticides: The Facility has implemented provisions of the National Fire Protection Association and Uniform Fire Code for the storage of pesticides at their facility;  U.S. OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.38, \"Employee emergency response plan and fire prevention plans\"; and U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, \"Hazardous waste operations and emergency response.\"   \n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, or regulated pesticides in the past five years that:\n\n7    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n7    have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n \n6.    The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n     7    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     7    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n     7    Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n"
