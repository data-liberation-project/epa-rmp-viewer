If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\n7 The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The regulated pesticides are received, stored and distributed for direct application in pest control.\n \n7 Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck or rail car and stored in 2 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 112,000 pounds.\n\n7 Anhydrous ammonia is loaded from the 2 stationary storage tanks into field application tanks that are stored at the site until they are transported to the user. There is a maximum of 93 application tanks at the site at any time during the year with the maximum total amount of anhydrous ammonia thus stored being 294,000 pounds.\n \n7 Aqua ammonia is received by tanker truck or mixed onsite and stored in 2 above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 192,000 pounds.\n \n7 The maximum quanti"

Anhydrous Ammonia (Stationary Storage Tanks) - Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 56,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l is 2.8 miles. The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a 2 diameter hose.

Anhydrous Ammonia (Field Application Tanks) - Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest field application tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.014 mg/l is 0.2 miles.
