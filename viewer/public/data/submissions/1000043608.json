The part of the system subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  \n\n \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n \n\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Birchwood Power Facility is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program is the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility for the individual program elements. Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring Plant employee are adequately trained and tested in the RMP program elements; ensuring new equipment and modifications to the ammonia storage and dilution system are designed, constructed, operated and maintained by following facility-wide Management of Change Procedures, and observing Pre-startup Review and Hot Work Permit Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and conducting periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\n  \n\nThe RMP is also written to meet the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.

Ammonia flow to the dilution skid can be remotely shut off in the event of a pipe leak.
