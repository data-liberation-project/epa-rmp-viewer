Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000-gallon truckload quantities.\n\nSimilarly, our raw materials, which we receive from suppliers, come in various  containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand. We receive materials in bags, pails, drums, totes, supersacks, and bulk containers. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Solenis - Macon Plant covers 14.73 acres, of which 2.37 acres are used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot or open lawn, or idle areas.\n\n\n\nAt the facility, cyclohexylamine is a chemical raw material stored onsite as a liquid in 55-gallon drums.  The maximum inventory is 42,742 pounds. Cyclohexylamine acts as a corrosion inhibitor by neutralizing acids and elevating pH in steam condensate, which makes it particularly useful as a component of our product line and to our customers.  This material is stored in a protected area and removed from any combustion sources.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that are taken to identify, evaluate, and prevent or mitigate releases of hazardous chemicals that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.

A maximum drum storage inventory limit has been established for cyclohexylamine.  This limit is maintained in the facility SAP purchasing system.  Receiving personnel move cyclohexylamine drums immediately to the designated storage area upon receipt. A single layer-only operating practice, when transporting RMP-regulated substances on-site via forklift truck, has been implemented. Plant personnel transport only the required number of drums for the scheduled batch into the blending room. The prevention program also includes requirements for performing compliance audits of the implementation of the prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAt the Solenis - Macon Plant we have not had any accidental releases that resulted in significant death, injury, property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property or environmental damage in the past 5 years due to the use or handling of cyclohexylamine.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOur chemical release response program contains these elements:\n\n- Identification of emergency organization personnel structure and functional responsibilities\n\n- Quarterly inspections to determine any new sources of ignition and a check of safety control devices\n\n- Annual inspections by Factory Mutual \n\n- Fire extinguisher training  \n\n- Annual fire drills conducted by our facility\n\n- Written procedures for handling emergency situations \n\n- Evacuation procedures and external response notifications\n\n- Incident coordination w"
