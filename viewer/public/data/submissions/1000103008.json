The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Ventura Coastal - Tipton facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 40,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nVentura Coastal - Tipton has had no defined accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nVentura Coastal - Tipton\u0092s emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- Cal/OSHA\u0092s Emergency Action Plan \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\n- Cal/OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] \u0096 Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] \u0096 Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Eme"
