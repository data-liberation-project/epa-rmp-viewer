      "SummaryText": "CMSA EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCentral Marin Sanitation Agency (CMSA) is committed to protecting the health and safety of CMSA employees and the public.  The CMSA wastewater treatment plant is staffed on a 24-hour basis with State of California certified Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators.  At least once every 8-hour shift, all plant processes are directly observed.  In addition, a plant process control computer monitors readings from approximately 2,000 sensors in the plant and alarms alert staff immediately to potential problems.  The computer and sensors are maintained by three instrument technicians.\n\nIn 1996, CMSA ceased use of gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide, converting use to the liquid equivalents of these chemicals.  The change was implemented to avoid the risk these toxic gases represented to the surrounding community.\n\nAs discussed below, CMSA has a written Emergency Response Plan which specifies procedures in response to various emergency events.  CMSA staff are trained for their roles in the procedures.\n\nThe CMSA Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCMSA is a public agency which operates the regional wastewater treatment plant.  The plant provides secondary treatment for sewage, prior to discharge to San Francisco Bay.  Sewage solids are anaerobically digested, dewatered, and then used as daily cover at a local municipal landfill.  Discharge to the Bay and disposal of treated biosolids are regulated under an NPDES permit issued by the State of California.\n\nA flammable gas is produced as a by-product in two one million-gallon anaerobic digester vessels.  The flammable component of the gas is methane, which is the only Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated substance at CMSA.  The gas is stored in the digester vessels and used as fuel to heat the digestion process and to generate a portion of the electricity that CMSA uses for the treatment processes.\n\nCMSA stores and uses substantial qu"

      "SummaryText": "antities of hazardous substances which are not regulated substances under the RMP.  These are sodium hypochlorite, sodium bisulfite, hydrogen peroxide, ferric chloride, propane, gasoline, and diesel fuel.\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for CMSA's analysis was a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum quantity of methane that can be contained in one of the digester vessels (3,200 pounds).  Using EPA's RMP*Comp software, the endpoint was estimated to be 0.1 miles (530 feet).  The endpoint is the maximum distance at which the explosion would be expected to shatter glass windows.  There are no public receptors, as defined by the RMP, within a 0.1 mile radius of either digester vessel.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nCMSA digester gas is eligible for Program 1 of the RMP, and therefore a formal Risk Prevention Program is not required for digester gas.  CMSA has reviewed existing O&M procedures related to digester gas and determined that they are sufficient to protect employees and the public.\n\nThe Five-year accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents or identified near misses involving digester gas at CMSA since the plant went on-line in 1984.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nCMSA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) provides information and guidelines needed to effectively coordinate and and implement response to fire, earthquake, hazardous material spills, and other emergencies.  The ERP incorporates elements of California's Standardized Emergency Management System.  Elements of the ERP have been coordinated with the local responder, the San Rafael Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCMSA has recently completed a hazard review for its storage and use of propane as emergency fuel.  During the Summer of 1999, CMSA intends to implement the equivalent of a Risk Prevention Program for propane, including revised O&M procedures and employee training."
