At this site, Albemarle produces sample quantities (1 kg level) to semi-commerical quantities of various catalysts, flame retardants, argicultural intermediates, and pharmaceutical products.  Additionally, Albermarle has truck unloading facilities to receive and store elemental bromine.  This bromine has been supplied via pipeline to an adjacent external facility and to processes within the plant for over a decade.\n\nCurrently Albemarle has on site RMP covered levels of one toxic chemical, bromine, and one flammable, diethyl ether.  Bromine is used extensively in two processes, 1) the Bromine supply terminal, and 2) manufacture of a polymeric flame retardant, HP-7010.  Bromine is used in lesser quantities in the Pilot Plant Building for process development purposes.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - In its operations, Albemarle is committed to the safety of the surrounding community, as well as protection of the environment.  With a strong Process Safety Management program in place, Albemarle combines both passive and active mitigation systems to prevent offsite consequences in the event of a spill of bromine.  In addition, our highly trained Emergency Response team is always available to respond to any incident, and bring it quickly under control.  Emergency responders are trained annually, and a trained Incident Commander is on site at all times to coordinate response emergency procedures.\n\nFive Year Accident History - There have been no offsite accidents at this location that had any adverse effects to neighboring industry or the community.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Albemarle is commi"

      "SummaryText": "tted to an ever improving safety program to maintain its rating in the top 5% in the chemical industry.  An increased emphasis is being placed on Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) of all chemical operations including lab safety audits for all bench scale processess for new projects.  Training in 2000 focused on schooling a large percentage of our wageroll and technical force in PHA techniques and developing additional technical PHA leaders to ensure that processess started up at our R&D Process Development Center are evaluated with regard to safety, health, and environmental aspects.  We have implemented Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to improve the quality of PHA studies to ensure thoroughess and effectiveness.   We have also implemented a reactive hazard evaluation program in January, 2004, with the goal of identifying reactive hazards which might occur during our normal or upset conditions.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Albemarle employs the latest technology in its process controls, and monitoring and mitgation systems to ensure that accidental releases are prevented or the risks associated with them are minimized.  Process documentation for covered processes are in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 requirements for Process Safety Management (PSM).  Equipment inspections are scheduled and documented to ensure vessel integrities.  Bromine storage and handling equipment are either glass-lined carbon steel, kynar lined piping, or nickel piping and vessel.  Area monitors are maintained to detect bromine."
