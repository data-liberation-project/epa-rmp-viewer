If a spill occurred, the entire contents should stay in a dike.\nA new tank dike partition was constructed in late 2001 to minimize potential RMP worst case scenario off-site impact.\n Automatic high level alarms and shutoffs are installed to prevent tank overfilling.\n The tank is filled to no more than 90% capacity, as additional protection against overfilling. \n Pressure/safety devices are installed so that the tank cannot be over/under pressurized.\n Shutoff valves can be activated remotely to isolate the tank if necessary.\n During tank filling, the unloading trailer is staged in an contained area large enough to hold the entire trailer contents.\n Sewers in the vicinity of the tank can be used if necessary to convey spillage to a pre-treatment system capable of treating NPCF.\n Pre-startup safety reviews are con"

We believe it is a comprehensive plan, developed and continually improved over more than 45 years of operation.  However, it is recognized that there may exist a remote possibility that an unforeseen emergency event could occur.  Accordingly, our RMP describes what could theoretically happen in such an event.   This summary is organized as follows:\n\nIntroduction; \nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety;\nFacility Identification and regulated substances in covered processes;\nPrevention Program; \nFive-Year Accident History; \nEmergency Response Plan; and\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ATOFINA Chemicals for many years;  this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  We are committed to conducting our operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety starts with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Senior management routinely dedicate time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors. \n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc.'s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill its commitment to health, environment, and safety.

In issues related to emergency response, ATOFINA Chemicals works with the Livingston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to plan responses to emergencies and to assist the Plant Emergency Organization (PEO) in actual response efforts as and if needed.  These emergency plans are reviewed with the LEPC, and other local emergency responders like the fire and police departments, and hospitals.  Our plant's Community Advisory Panel (CAP) was started in early 1998 to inform the community about our plant and related activities and address questions or concerns. \n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc. also takes pride in our commitment to protect the environment.  We are dedicated to continuous reduction of waste, and have a comprehensive program called E-3 (Enhancing Environmental Excellence) designed to promote recycling and waste minimization. \n\nATOFINA is also part of Responsible Care\u00ae, an industry-wide initiative among members of the American Chemistry Council. Through Responsible Care, our industry demonstrates its continuing commitment to health, safety, and the environment.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nThe ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc.
