      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Program for the Ocmulgee River Water Treatment Plant minimizes the likelihood and potential effects of a chemical accident involving chlorine by identifying and reducing potential hazards as well as preparing employees and responders to handle a chemical emergency.  This is accomplished by establishing a program in accordance with the EPA's requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part 68 providing for employee and public safety\n\nThe importance dedicated to the safe operation of the Ocmulgee River plant is reflected in its record of no reportable releases or accidents involving chlorine since the plant opened in 1990.  The continued safety to the plant's employees and the surrounding community will be further ensured through the implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Ocmulgee River WTP, located below Lake Jackson east of Jackson, Georgia, uses chlorine to disinfect water taken from the nearby Ocmulgee River as part of the treatment process necessary to provide clean drinking water for Butts County.  The plant stores as much as 8,000 lbs. of chlorine in one-ton containers that hold 2,000 lbs. each of liquified chlorine under pressure.  The chlorination process involves a system where chlorine gas is piped from these containers and then controlled and metered until being applied to the raw water creating a chlorine solution.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was conducted, using software provided by the EPA for this purpose called RMP*Comp, to assess the potential off-site area at risk given an accidental release of chlorine from the plant were to occur.  A worst-case scenario was first considered involving an unlikely event in which the entire contents of a single container, 2,000 lbs., escaped over a ten-minute period.  An alternate-case scenario was then conducted to assess a potential accident thought to be more likely to occur than the worst-case.  This situation assumed chlorine was released at a rate of 10.5 lbs./sec. for 60 minutes consi"

In each case, the modeling was performed to determine the distance a chlorine cloud could possibly reach before dissipating to an acceptable level, called the toxic endpoint, at which it is believed that an individual can be exposed for up to an hour without experiencing significant effects.\n\nThe worst-case scenario resulted in an endpoint distance of 3.0 miles.  Within this radial distance from the plant, there live an estimated population of 1,520 people which could potentially be effected.  The alternate-case produced a distance of 0.2 miles effecting approximately 6 people. \n\nFor each of these scenarios it is important to point out that the modeling results are intended to serve as a simplified guide in establishing the entire area surrounding the plant at risk in the event of a chlorine release. The actual behavior of a chlorine cloud will depend to a large degree on the local topography since chlorine gas is 2.5 times as heavy as air.  The toxic cloud will be more likely to flow down hill than to have its path determined by prevailing winds. Furthermore, no mitigation measures such as enclosures and the abundance of trees in the area, which would each hinder the advance of a toxic cloud, were considered when inputting information into the models.\n\nDue to the topography surrounding the Ocmulgee River WTP, a significant releae of chlorine would most likely flow downhill to the river and then continue along its downstream path regardless of wind direction.  For this reason, the distances established by the model will more likely apply to the less populated region downriver from the plant rather than the more densely populated area surrounding Lake Jackson.\n\nTo lessen the likelihood and mitigate the effects of a potential release of chlorine, the Ocmulgee River WTP's Risk Management Program provides a means for ensuring that personnel operating the plant are sufficiently pr"

Operator training on operating procedures and emergency response\n4.  Preventive maintenance\n5.  Emergency action \n\nTo ensure that an emergency situation is handled effectively, this RMP includes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The EAP details appropriate procedures for the plant operators to follow in responding to a chlorine accident including stopping a leak and contacting emergency personnel.  The ERP provides local emergency responders with information necessary to sufficiently understand the hazards a potential escaping chlorine cloud poses to the community and to properly respond to an accident at the plant.  The ERP will soon be incorporated into the cummunity's written emergency response plan and has been coordinated with Butts County Emergency Services, the Jackson Fire Dept., the 911 Dispatcher's Office, and the Jasper County Emergency Management Office.\n\nEffective emergency action and response is ensured through ongoing training of emergency response procedures.  Plant operators are trained on chlorine hazards, stopping chlorine leaks, and emergency procedures and equipment.  \n\nTo further improve safety at this facility, the plant will soon be installing electronic air monitoring equipment to ensure that, if a leak were to occur, personnel will respond and correct it as quickly as possible.\n\nThis Risk Management Program is designed so that each element may be easily implemented and maintained ensuring that potential hazards are closely monitored, operators stay sufficiently trained, and an emergency will be handled as efficiently as possible.  This will assure that the Commerce Water Treatment Plant will continue the safe operation of its chlorination process while providing quality drinking water for Butts County."
