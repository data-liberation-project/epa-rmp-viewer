      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Chemours Chambers Works facility is committed to operating and maintaining all manufacturing processes in a safe and responsible manner.  The site follows the philosophy \"Commitment to ZERO\", which constantly strives for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  Site programs, procedures and management practices are in place to support our organizations commitment.  Progress is constantly assessed against our commitment and corrective actions are taken whenever necessary.\n\n\n\nAlthough the primary focus of the facility is on accidental release prevention, the site also possesses and maintains strong emergency response capabilities to back-up prevention activities.  The combination of prevention programs and emergency response capabilities is used to ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as, the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) Risk Management Program regulation;\n\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases;\n\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n\n? An overview of our Emergency Response program;\n\n? A five-year history of accidental release of chemicals regulated by the TCPA rule;\n\n? An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Chambers Works facility first opened in the early 1900s as a dye manufacturing plant.  As of July 1, 2015, DuPont will spin off the Performance Chemicals business into a new company (The Chemo"

These scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information has been used on Chambers Works for many years as part of our process safety management program. Our program parameters model potential releases and analyze the results to help the site continuously improve process and risk reduction efforts. The site continues to conduct these assessments as part of internal process safety management systems. Release scenario details can be found in the site's Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nFor many years, employees at Chambers works have applied rigorous process safety management practices to all our processes, not just those covered by regulations.  These practices include:\n\n\n\n? A thorough understanding of our process technology including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of constriction for equipment;\n\n? Proper design and installation of equipment:\n\n? Systematic process hazard review studies to identify and manage process hazards;\n\n? Written operating and maintenance procedures;\n\n? Extensive training for all individuals involved in operating or maintaining a chemical process;\n\n? Mechanical integrity testing and preventiv"

Mechanical quality assurance programs to ensure the correct spare parts are installed every time maintenance work is done;\n\n? Procedures to assess and manage the safety and environmental impact of changes to the process technology or equipment;\n\n? Pre-startup safety reviews for equipment that is newly installed or modified;\n\n? Compliance audits to ensure process safety and environmental impact of changes to the process technology or equipment;\n\n? Investigation of actual and potential incidents to identify and implement corrective actions;\n\n? Participation of all employees in the process safety management system;\n\n? Document safe work practices, including hot work permits; and\n\n? A contractor management system to ensure work done by contractors is done safely and meets  corporate quality standards.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the practices described above, site personnel have designed site processes to include multiple layers of safeguards.  Examples of these include:\n\n\n\n? Automatic valves for rail cars, which isolate the supply of materials form the rail car in event of a process upset;\n\n? Computer display and control of process parameters;\n\n? Process alarms to warn operators of process deviations;\n\n? Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\n\n? Low concentration chemical detectors that either provide alarms to operators or automatically isolate leaks if the chemical is detected;\n\n? Relief valves to prevent over-pressuring of equipment\n\n? Emergency scrubbers to prevent emissions from emergency systems from reaching the environment;\n\n? Excess flow valves that close automatically if the chemical flow rate indicates a potential line leak;\n\n? Deluge systems built into the process to quickly suppress chemical fumes or fires;\n\n?

Minimization of hazardous material storage inventories, including manufacturing some highly hazardous materials only when we can immediately consume them to make products.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn addition to release prevention measures, Chambers Works maintains a highly trained and equipped Emergency Response department. They are able to respond to any chemical release to mitigate the impact.\n\n  \n\nThe site is committed to maintaining strong emergency response capabilities to back-up our prevention activities.  The Emergency Response brigade is comprised of both Chemours and DuPont employees and are specially trained operators that can respond in the event of an onsite chemical release. The Emergency Response team is thoroughly trained, properly equipped and staffed 24 hours a day. \n\n\n\nChambers Works conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  These drills simulate potential accidental release and test emergency response plans.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nIn addition to on-site activities, Chambers works maintains transportation emergency response capability, which allows the site to respond to chemical transportation incidents outside the Chambers Works site.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents in the past 5 years that meet the Risk Management Plan reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs part of our process hazards review procedures, all of our processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.
