      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe ArcelorMittal Indiana Harbor East facility is an iron and steel manufacturer located in Lake County in Northwest Indiana on the shore of Lake Michigan.  The facility site occupies approximately 2,200 acres.\n\nOperations at the site began on July, 21, 1902.  The primary processes include the production of iron in blast furnaces and steel in Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) processes and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) melting.  Finishing operations at the facility include the operation of blooming mills, bar mills, hot strip mill, temper mills, annealing furnaces, and coating, cutting and shearing operations.  Support facilities include power generation plants, recycle and waste recovery operations, and wastewater treatment.\n\nThe facility is bounded to the west by the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal and Lake Michigan; to the north and east by Lake Michigan; and to the south and southeast by industrial property and Highway 912.  Land use in the vicinity of the ArcelorMittal site is a combination of industrial, commercial, residential and recreational areas.\n\nArcelorMittal operates under the General Environmental Policy (April 2008) of \"Protect and Improve the Environment\".  The guiding principles of the policy are:  implementation and maintenance of environmental management systems that support the achievement of this policy;  compliance with all relevant legislation, regulations, and other requirements; minimize our environmental impact through continual improvement of our equipment and process management capabilities; practice pollution prevention by minimizing emissions and waste generation, and through the efficient use of natural resources, energy and land; and establish and maintain practices, including audits and the setting of environmental objectives, to ensure adherence to this policy. \n\nAt the Indiana Harbor East site, chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound cylinders and is used for water treatment as a 1) biocide for slime control in process equipment, and"

The storage and transfer (metering into the wastewater treatment systems) process is subject to both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention (RMP) regulations.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nIn order to prevent accidents, ArcelorMittal personnel have implemented a comprehensive safety program that incorporates multiple layers of safety.  Those layers of safety involve engineering controls, operating practices and management review.  The following summarizes the layers of safety in place at the Indiana Harbor East facility:\n\nLAYERS OF SAFETY\n\nProcess and Technology - a) rigorous compliance with standards (including Process Safety Management) and codes,  b) structured hazard analysis, and c) comprehensive preventive maintenance.\n\nSafety and People - a) documented operating procedures,  b) ongoing employee training,  c) strict contractor rules, and d) employee participation.\n\nManagement and Support Program -  a) management of change,  b) incident investigation, and c) periodic compliance audits.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY - ArcelorMittal has experienced no reportable accidents in the Five-Year Accident History.\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPONSE MEASURES\n\nArcelorMittal personnel have developed a sophisticated emergency response capability.  The fundamentals of the emergency response program are early detection, prompt effective communications, and source control.  The elements of the emergency reponse program for chlorine include:  a) chlorine leak sensors linked to alarms,  b) 24-hour monitoring of alarms,  c) documented communication/reporting procedures,  d) trained emergency reponse team on-site,  and  e) extensive emergency reponse equipment maintained on-site."
