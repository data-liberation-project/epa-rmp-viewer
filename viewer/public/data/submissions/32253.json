If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mazon Fire Department, Grundy County Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 2-12,000 and 1-30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantityof anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 431,000 pounds, this includesthe amount of anhydrous ammonisa that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Ruls and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has imnplementedcx the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSAH) 29 CFR 1910111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident prevention program.\n\nTherer have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; not\n-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has:\n-a written emergenc"
