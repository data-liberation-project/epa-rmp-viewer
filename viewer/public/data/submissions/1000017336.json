Executive Board is committed to making our facilities the safest plants in Indiana.\nThe only regulated chemical used by Maple Leaf Farms is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  There is approximately 21,000 lbs of ammonia within the system. At most times the system charge is somewhat lower than this number.\nAs a part of our prevention plan we have performed a worst case and alternate release scenario centered around the possibility of an ammonia release. Our worst case scenario centers around the possibility of an ammonia release from our receiver during a pump down situation. Our alternate release scenario is centered around a piping release on the roof.\nMaple Leaf Farms, Serenade Foods Division has in place a Process Safety Management / Risk Program.  As a result of the PSM / RMP Program the following procedures and policies are in place:\n     Employee Participation Guidelines\n     Employee Training\n     Contractor Qualification Guidelines\n     Pre-Startup Procedures\n     Mechanical Integrity Inspection Policy\n     Support Personnel Entry Program\n     Hot Work Permit Program\n     Management of Change Program\n     Incident Investigation Program\n     Emergency Planning and Response Plan\n     Compliance Audit Procedure done by outside contractor\n     Dissemination/Trade Secrets Policy\n     Policy for Opening the Refrigeration System\n     Process Hazard Analysis\nMechanical Integrity inspections are done annually to ensure the equipment is"

Any problems are addressed and repaired as needed.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nMaple Leaf Farms-Serenade Division, Milford, Indiana is a poultry based processing and distribution facility. The facility incorporates a standard evaporation and compression closed loop ammonia refrigeration system. The system is installed to operate as a two-temperature single stage system. The compressors are split as High Stage and Low Stage Compressors. There exists, two different levels of saturated suction temperatures. Each level of suction temperature services a specific area of the plant.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nMaple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division has not had a release in excess of 100 lbs of ammonia in the last five years.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nWarsaw HAZMAT Team is our primary response in the event of a catastrophic release or a release at night or on weekends.  They have toured our facilities and given us a hazard analysis.  We will be having drills twice yearly to familiarize the team with the equipment and procedures to be followed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBecause of executive support Maple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division maintains a comprehensive PSM program. This support allows our PSM / RMP team to have the freedom to make necessary improvements as they are identified.\nMaple Leaf Farms Serenade Foods Division provides certification training opportunities for employees directly and indirectly involved with the ammonia refrigeration system through courses offered  by 3rd party consultants. This provides a better understanding of the operation of our ammonia refrigeration system allowing for safe operation of the system.\n"
