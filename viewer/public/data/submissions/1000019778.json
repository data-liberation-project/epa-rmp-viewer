Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\nThe Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Johnson County Generation Facility in Cleburne, Texas, handles anhydrous ammonia\nwhich is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe\ncertain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our \nemployees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules\nand regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design\nof the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nBrazos Electric's emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The\nemergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially effected\nneighbors.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe primary purpose of the Brazos Electric facility is to produce electric power from the combustion of natural gas.  Anhydrous\nammonia is used at the facility to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced during combustion.  Anhydrous\nammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in a single storage tank.  The ammonia is transported by\npipeline, from storage and injected into the combustion system where it reacts with the natural gas combustion products to \nminimize NOx formation.  Access to the site is restricted to authhorized facility employees, authorized management personnel\nand authorized contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia that can be stored\nat this plant is 62,280 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case and Alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnative Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release would be a catastrophic failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank when filled to capacity.  This\nworst-case scenario would release 62,280 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor \nwithin 10 minutes of the failure.  The distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14 mg/l ammonia fo this worst-case scenario\nis 2.8 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe more realistic alternative-case release would be the failure of a 2-inch diameter anhydrous ammonia will pipeline.  This\nscenario would result in a total release of 70 pounds of ammonia.  The distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14 mg/l\nammonia for this alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Preventioon Program\nThe Brazos Electric generation facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\ncodes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable ammonia storage and\nhandling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system are thorougly\ntrained using Brazos Electric's documented training program.  Operators are recertified every 2 years  A process safety \nmanagement review is coducted every 3 years with the most current conducted in December 2005.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases of ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life of this facility.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\nBrazos Electric's emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of ammonia.  We have discussed this\nprogram with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Cleburne Fire Department (Randy Jenkins -- Cleburne\nfire department.)"
