In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is retail sales to farm producers and wholesale sales to lawn and garden dealers. We are engaged in receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facilities used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and late fall months. During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with little if any product transfer taking place.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery. Annual hours for these do not meet the 2080 hour requirment to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site; therefore, item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have emergency showers, eye wash stations, and water tanks available in case"

      "SummaryText": "of any release. The facilities also have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times for day or night use, and throughout the \"off season\" when not in use.\n\nWorst - Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nAs we have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the past 5 years at the site, we believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose. Transfer hoses are protected by manual, self closing excess flow, and \"pull away\" valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on the guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Additionally, we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Break-away couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended. Finally, we maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training excercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nWe have not had a release of Anhydrous Ammonia within the past five years that has caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have resulted in offside deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place"

We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38. We provide State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety program include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they conform to the community plan(s). We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia training programs by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, community planners, etc., that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all our facilities. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time. \n\nAdditional Information:\n\nFor additional information, response to questions, facility tours, or comments, please contact:\n\nJerri Weimer                   at                 (308) 247-2126                       Morrill, Nebraska"
