The resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation and operation of our butane system demonstrate this commitment.    \r\n\r\nFacility Description and Substance Handled.\r\n\r\nLucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal is located at 2455 North Second Street, Memphis, TN. Lucy-Woodstock stores, loads and unloads butane. Butane is a flammable gas under normal temperatures and pressure.  However, under pressure butane is a liquid.  Butane meets the definition of a NFPA 4 flammable.\r\n\r\nButane Sphere T-101 provides storage for 48,000 barrles of butane. Safety relief valves are set to relieve to atmosphere at 75 psi. Instrumentation on T-101 consists of a level indicator, level transmitter, level alarm high and level alarm high-high.  A safety switch and firesafe valve is provided on the tank suction line to the tank loading pump to close in the event of an emergency.  Pump P-3 is utilized for loading of butane tank trucks, and if required, Pump-7 may be utilized to unload tank trucks. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Specific Steps\r\n\r\nLucy-WoodstockMarine Terminal has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. The program addresses the butane handling that is covered by the EPA's RMP rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program involves process design, equipment design, and construction to meet all applicable codes and standards.  In addition, there are a number of safety systems, such as process controls, warning alarms, and operational controls in place to prevent a release from occuring. \r\n\r\nLucy-Woodstock marine Terminal has written safety information  on the butane process, equipment and procedures available to all employees"

      "SummaryText": "who work in the terminal.  This includes information on the hazards of butane, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.\r\n\r\nThe overall effectiveness of the accidental release prevention programs are modified by a Process Hazard Analyisi (PHA) which has been performed for the butane system.  The PHA provides a method for understanding potential hazardous events, the means by which they occur and what actions are likely to prevent them from occurring. A team approach is used on the PHA to evaluate the potential consequences of failures in the butane system.  The safeguards in place for each hazard are recorded and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Recommendations are then made to improve safety where the existing safeguards were not considered adequate by the PHA team. A PHA of the butane system was completed in 2004 and will be updated on a 5-year cycle. \r\n\r\nThe basis for proper and safe operation of the butane system is provided by written operating procedures. These procedures define the operating limits, identify safety and health consideration, and detail the operation and function of safety systems.  Specific modes of operation covered are startup, normal operation, emergency and normal shutdown, and temporary operations.\r\n\r\nTo complement the written operating procedures, Lucy-woodstock marine Terminal's employees receive training in specific safety and health hazards, operation of the butane system, emergency operations and all applicable safe work practices for the system.\r\n\r\nLucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal has a mechanical integrity program to ensure that all equipment is regularly inspected and maintained.  All inspections and maintenance operations are documented. Lucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal has quality assurance measures to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that the proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nLucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage"

The MOC procedure ensures that all changes are documented, properly authorized, and that all employees whose job tasks will be affected by the change are informed and receive appropriate training prior to the change. \r\n\r\nA pre-startup safety review will be conducted for any new covered process or significant modification to the butane system.  The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared prioe to operation.  The performance of these safety programs and procedures is monitored through audits, periodic drills and inspections.\r\n\r\nLucy-Woodstock Marine Termianl will investigate any incident that results in, or could result in, a release of butane.  These investigations will follow a written procedure and be performed by a site team.  The goal of incident investigation is to determine tha root cause of the accident and to develop corrective actions to prevent reoccurance of the accident.  All corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team recommendations will be tracked until complete.\r\n\r\nThe employee participation plan details employee involvement in safety and the prevention program.\r\n\r\nLucy-Woodstock Terminal has a contractor safety program to ensure that contractors who work in or adjacent to the butane system are properly trained and meet safety criteria defined by Lucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAs a result of Lucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal's commitment to safety, there have been no accidents as defined in the RMP rule in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nTo be prepared for potential fires, Lucy-Woodstock Marine Terminal communicates with the Memphis Fire Department who is contacted by the terminal in the event of a butane release.
