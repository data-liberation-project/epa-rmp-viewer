If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enivornment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n-Anyhdrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for sale to farmers.\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 251,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE CASE SCENARIO\n     The worst case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release form the largest vessel identified as holding 78,000 pounds liquified under pressure by design standards.  By using RMP Comp it was determined that release of this would meet the endpoint of  3.3 miles.  The impact would be on residents of about 70.  Alternative release of 100 lbs. of ammonia would affect approximately 15 people.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, J-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910-111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n     It was found that there has been no accidents or reportable off-premises releases at this facility.  The emergency response program is on file with Local Emergency Planning Coordinator.  Safetly improvements is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenace of safe conditions."
