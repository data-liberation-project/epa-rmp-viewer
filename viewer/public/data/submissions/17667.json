THE RAW WATER AND FINISHED WATER ARE DISINFECTED WITH CHLORINE. THE CHLORINATION PROCESS USES CHLORINE CYLINDERS (TON CONTAINERS),CHLORINATION EQUIPMENT RELEVANT INSTRUMENTATION, ELECTRIC AND PROCESS \nSAFETY EQUIPMENT.\n\nTHE\" WORST CASE\" SCENARIO; AS DEFINED BY U.S.EPA. STATES THAT \"THE OWNER OR OPERATOR SHALL ASSUME THAT THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY IN THE LARGEST VESSEL IS RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.\"ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\" IS DEFINED AS \"MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THEN THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\". A REVIEW OF THE PAST INCIDENT HISTORY FOR THIS FACILITY WAS MADE AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT RELEASE OF CHLORINE GAS FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS OR MORE.\n\nTHE CITY OF CUMMING WATER PRODUCTION FACILITY IS LOCATED IN AN AREA WITH FEW BUILDIINGS \nOR OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS AND SO IT IS ASSUMED AS RURAL CONDITIONS. THE GUIDANCE ASSUMES \nMETEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF ATMOSPHERE STABILITY CLASS \"F\"  (STABLE ATMOSPHERE) AND WIND SPEED 1.5 METERS PER SECOND (3.4 MILES PER HOUR)\nAMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE FOR THIS GUIDANCE IS 25 DEGREES CELSIUS (77 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT). THIS AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IS ASSUMED FOR THE WORST CASE, AS PER GUIDANCE, EVEN IF THE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE,  AT THIS LOCATION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WAS HIGHER.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR THIS FACILITY INVOLVES A FAILURE OF AN ONE TON\nCYLINDER YEIL"
