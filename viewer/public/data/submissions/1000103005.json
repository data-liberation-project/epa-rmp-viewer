      "SummaryText": "Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard require all facilities with a threshold amount of 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to comply with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1919.119.  Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., Oklahoma City Division has the capability of holding 31,000 pounds in a single refrigeration system, which is above the threshold specified by OSHA and EPA.  Therefore, the Oklahoma City Division is required to comply with OSHA and EPA requirements.\r\n\r\nThe primary activities at the facility are receiving and distributing groceries and grocery related products, which necessitates the need for keeping perishable items cool or at freezing temperatures or below.  \r\n\r\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers Oklahoma City Division has an active Process Safety Management Program which consists of extensive inspections and preventative maintenance schedules designed to prevent the leaking of anhydrous ammonia.  AWG's five-year accident history consists of zero accidents.  \r\n\r\nAssociated Wholesale Grocers, Inc. has conducted a dispersion analysis of a potential incident involving a release of anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant at the Oklahoma City Council Road Facility location.    The results of this analysis are to be used by the Oklahoma City Council road facility in their emergency planning, response, and training activites.  An anhydrous ammonia dispersion analysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of a release of anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nAWG's emergency response includes training of personnel, alert systems, and coordination with the local fire department."
