Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. - Church Hill, Tennessee (MarkWest) facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program in place at the Church Hill facility encompasses such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Hawkins County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses propane storage and wholesale distribution.  The one substance present at the facility regulated by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is propane, which is delivered to the facility by rail car and tank truck.  The propane is stored in one of ten 30,000-gallon capacity vessels.  The propane is then distributed to various customers by tank truck loading and also by pipeline to the adjacent Quebecor Printing facility.\n\nTotal quantities of product stored in each of the 30,000-gallon capacity vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief vessels provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\n\nBas"

      "SummaryText": "ed on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory present in any one vessel would be equal to 90% of the total 30,000-gallon capacity: 27,000 gallons (the equivalent of 114,124 pounds) of propane.  Therefore, the maximum quantity of propane present at the facility is equal to ten vessels containing 27,000 gallons each: 270,000 gallons (the equivalent of 1,141,240 pounds) of propane. \n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables  and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from one of the ten 30,000-gallon capacity vessels in the propane storage process.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 27,000 gallons (114,124 lbs) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Offsite receptors would be affected.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from one of the ten 30,000-gallon capacity vessels in the propane storage process.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 27,000 gallons (114,124 lbs) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion.

The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n    Steps\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the RMP regulations.  The propane storage and distribution process at MarkWest is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest Church Hill facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The \"What If?\" methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operat"
