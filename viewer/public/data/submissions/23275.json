A MORE LIKELY OCCURENCE WOULD BE THE LEAKING OF A MUCH SMALLER NURSE TANK.   THESE TANKS HOLD 1000 TO 1500 GALLON VERSUS THE 30,000 GALLON CAPACITY OF THE MAIN TANKS.\n     SMITH FERTILIZER AND GRAIN HAS DETERMINED WHAT EVENTS WOULD MOST LIKELY CAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE.   WE DETERMINED THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE WOULD BE THE TAMPERING OF EQUIPTMENT BY UNTRAINED INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO OBTAIN ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURING METHAMPHETAMINE.  SMITH FERTILIZER AND GRAIN HAS INITIATED SEVERAL MEASURES TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AND TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE IN THE EVENT AN ACCIDENT WOULD OCCUR.\n     THESE MEASURES INCLUDE:\n1. CONDUCTING REGULAR VISUAL INSPECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO SIGNS OF TAMPERING.\n2. DELIVERING ANHYDROUS AS CLOSE TO TIME OF APPLICATION AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID LEAVING TANKS IN UNATTENDED, DESERTED AREAS.\n3. ENCOURAGING THE PROMPT RETURN OF TANKS FOR THE SAME REASON.\n4. MAKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BY HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND DISTRIBUTING LITERATURE."
