Inc.\nStronghold Facility\n\n1.Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Basin Fertilizer and Chemical, Stronghold facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 46003 Hwy 139, Newell, CA, 96134 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.Facility Information\n\n\u00b7 The primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n\n\u00b7 Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production. \n \n\u00b7 Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in 1 above ground tank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 78,000 pounds.\n \n  \n3.The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 78,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.20 miles. The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a 2 inch line, (hose or pipe). The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.30 miles.\n\n.\n4.Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: The Facility"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia processes at the facility."
