The facility produces cheese and powdered whey from milk purchased from area farmers.\n\nThe processing of these dairy products requires the use of anhydrous ammonia and other chemicals.  Milk that arrives at the facility, as well as the products produced at the facility must be kept at refrigerated temperatures to maintain quality and shelf-life.  As a result of this need for chilling processes and refrigerated storage areas, Saputo utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system.  The system contains approximately 12,950 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\nAmmonia, although a necessary component of Saputo's processing, can be dangerous to employees, the public in the immediate vicinity of the plant, and the environment if released in an uncontrolled manner is substantial quantities.  Saputo has recongnized the inherent risks with ammonia and has therefore developed and implemented a Risk Management Program to:\n\n-prevent accidental releases of ammonia; and\n-respond appropriately to accidental releases, if any, of ammonia.\n\nSaputo's Prevention Program for ammonia consists of the following elements:\n\n1)  Safety information for ammonia has been gathered and evaluated to assit Saputo employees in understanding the hazards associated with the process.  This information then formed a basis for other prevention program elements to minimize the potential of accidental releases.\n2)  A hazard evaluation was completed for ammonia.  The purpose of the analysis was to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards in the process.\n3)  Written operating procedures were carefully developed so that employees at Saputo have access to written instructions for the safe operation of and maintenance of the ammonia process.\n4)  Employees at Saputo have been trained, and will continue to be trained, on the job and in the classroom, on"

Prior to the startup of any new or modified system, Saputo will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the changes and modify the Risk Management Program to incorporate the new or modified system.\n7)  Employees at Saputo have been part of the development of the Risk Management Program and will have a role in the continuous improvement of the program.\n8)  Any incident, accident, or even \"near misses\" associated with the ammonia system will be investigated thoroughly and promptly with a commitment to make improvements to the program.\n9)  As part of the continuous improvement process, Saputo will conduct a audits a least once every three years to identify and correct any parts of the program that are not functioning up to their standards.  These audits are in addition to efforts to improve the program on a regular basis.\n10)  Saputo will make sure its contractors on site are aware of the hazards associated with the ammonia system to protect all parties (contractors, employees, neighbors).  For specific tasks that require an even highter degree of oversight (such as welding, cutting, or grinding aroudn the ammonia refrigeration system), Saputo will require its employees and contractors to obtain internal permits that mandate special prevention measures.  \n\nSaputo has developed and implemented an emergency response program to protect public health, the environment, and on-site employees.  Employees have been trained in emergency response.
