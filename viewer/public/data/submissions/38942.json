      "SummaryText": "This RMP was prepared by Roquette America because Praxair owns, operates, and controls a hydrogen storage system on Roquette property; and because Praxair did not intend to submit an RMP for this process.  Praxair maintains that as the end user, Roquette is responsible for the RMP.\n\nThe RMP requirements apply to the owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold amount of a regulated substance in a process (40 CFR 68.10).  A stationary source is defined as any buildings, structures, equipment, installatioins, or substance emitting stationary activities\u00bfwhich are under the control of the same person\u00bf(40 CFR 68.3).  Praxair as the process equipment owner is solely responsible for the operation, inspection, and maintenance of the hydrogen storage facility.  Roquette has no access to the locked facility and has been instructed by Praxair to not interact with the equipment.  Because Praxair controls, as well as owns and operates, the facility, the hydrogen storage facility is a separate stationary source.  As it is a separate stationary source, it must also be a separate process; therefore, Praxair is legally responsible for completing the RMP.\n\nRoquette has answered to the best of our ability the questions in this submittal.  Roquette makes no claim to their accuracy or completeness.  Please contact Praxair, Inc. for additional details.  Roquette is filing this plan on behalf of Praxair in an effort to comply with all environmental laws and regulations.  Roquette maintains that compliance with the RMP rule is the responsibility of the persons that own and control the hydrogen storage system (Praxair).  Roquette takes this position based on its lack of ownership or control of the facility."
