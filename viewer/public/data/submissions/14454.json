The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nChuckawalla Valley State Prison has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Chuckawalla Prison Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Chuckawalla Valley State Prison to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nChuckawalla Valley State Prison is located at 19025 Wiley's Well Road, Blythe, California 92226.  The facility is located approximately 18 miles west of Blythe, and about 3 miles south of Interstate 10.  The area surrounding the facility is barren desert.  The chlorine system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is surrounded by chain link fence with access through one gate only.  Pre-cleared visitors are permitted to enter the facility by checking in with the guard.\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) covers approximately 89 acres and c"

There are four on-line at any time with up to seven additional cylinders stored.  The average design flow of the wastewater treatment plant is 1.8 million gallons per day.  This flow is generated from two sources: domestic wastewater from the existing prison facilities and water treatment waste, which includes process water from the water treatment plant.  After initial treatment processes clarify and remove suspended solids from the water, the wastewater is disinfected with chlorine treatment.  Title 22 requires that reclaimed water used for agricultural irrigation be treated to safeguard against the transmission of disease and infection.\n\nThe chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  This implies that a breach in the integrity of the system would result in air being sucked into the system, not a release of chlorine.  Chlorine is mixed into the wastewater via a chlorine gas mixer at the entrance of the Chlorine Contact Tank.  The chlorine feed rate is controlled by the chlorinators, which receive signals based on the wastewater residual sample analyzer (in order to maintain the desired residual concentration).  The treated wastewater is used to irrigate 217 acres of bermuda grass fields.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n*  Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n      Scenario Description:  Release of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in a vessel (one-ton container) - 2,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F stability.  A dispersion model for dense gas releases, Degadis, was used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm in rural conditions."

No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n*  Alternative Release Result Summary\n\n     Scenario Description: A release of chlorine resulting from a material failure of a fusible plug (normally designed to melt between 158-165 F).  The release rate of chlorine based on chemical-specific considerations is 5 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3.0 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Chuckawalla Valley State Prison WWTP operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nFour chlorine gas detectors are strategically located in the WWTP chlorine building.  In case of chlorine detection above 3 ppm, three red strobe lights outside the chlorine building are triggered.  The ventilation louvers close and the chlorine scrubber is activated.  Also, audible alarms are located near each chlorine sensor in the chlorine room.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, vacuum regulators and check valves prevent chlorine from escaping the system.  An emergency generator provides continuous electrical service for the WWTP to remain online.  Emergency power is also interlocked to the chlorine scrubbers.  This severely limits th"
