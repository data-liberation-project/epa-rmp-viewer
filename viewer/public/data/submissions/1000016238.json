The LNG storage tank is being reactivated to store LNG.  This RMP update generally addresses the station operation as a LNG storage facility.\n\n\nCalARP RMP Background\n\nThe purpose of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide guidelines for facilities in California to conduct business in an environmentally safe manner.  The legal authority for the CalARP Program is the California Health and Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2 (commencing with Section 25531).  The California Office of Emergency Services has issued implementation regulations under the California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) Small-Scale Natural Gas Liquefaction Facility (A?LNG FacilityA?) is subject to RMP requirements because the maximum intended inventory of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exceeds the 10,000-pound Federal threshold for methane (this threshold quantity is specified in Table 2 of 19 CCR 2770.5).  This threshold quantity is applicable because natural gas is composed of 96 percent methane.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPG&E is dedicated to protecting employees, the community, and the environment from chemical incidents through safe operation of the facility.  PG&E is committed to providing a safe place of business for the employees and surrounding community by aiming to create an injury and illness free work environment and a loss free environment for the benefit of themselves, their coworkers, their customers, and the general public.

      "SummaryText": "summarizes the programs and procedures in place at the LNG Facility to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals.  The RMP provisions are intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals from the facility and include such measures as a system hazard review, operation and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, implementation of a management system, and providing routine updates.\nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the covered process.  PG&EA?s policy is to implement industry best practice controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  In the event of an accidental release or other problem, the facility operators and contractors are trained to activate one of the emergency shutdown devices and evacuate the area if/as appropriate.  The ESD system also includes automatic equipment to detect problems and shut down the plant.\nFacility\nThe LNG Facility is located at 2001 Front Street, Sacramento, California.  The facility stores LNG for truck trailers used as portable gas pipeline supply.  The portions of the system subject to CalARP regulations are the LNG storage tank, associated piping and equipment, and the operations for transferring LNG from the storage tank to tanker trucks. \nThe primary LNG Facility activities are the storage, and transfer of LNG to transport trucks.  LNG storage is currently accomplished by a PG&E operator with the station control system.  LNG transfer from the storage tank to tanker trucks is conducted by PG&E operators.\nChemical Inventories\nAs LNG is received at the LNG Facility, it is transferred into the storage tank.  The amount stored in the storage tank exceeds the Federal RMP applicability threshold of 10,000 lbs.  The PG&E LNG Facility is subject to Program 3 requ"

      "SummaryText": "irements, as described in Section 7.0 below, because the facility storage quantity triggers the threshold for flammables under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations (Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR], Part 1910.119, and 8 CCR 5189) and the facility is not eligible for Program 1.  \nChemical Hazards\nToxicologically, methane is classified as a simple asphyxiant.  The routes of exposure are inhalation and dermal contact.  Methane is inactive biologically and essentially nontoxic.  Therefore, the major properties are the exclusion of an adequate supply of oxygen to the lungs; effects are dizziness, unconsciousness, and eventual collapse.  Skin contact with the LNG or cold piping presents a hazard of cold burn, and results in freezing or frostbite.\nThe main hazards associated with LNG are fire and explosion.  The flash point of methane is A?306 degrees Fahrenheit (closed cup), the lower flammability limit is 5 percent, and the upper flammability limit is 15 percent.\nHazard Assessment\nAs part of the PG&E CalARP RMP, the worst-case release scenario (WCS) and alternative-case release scenario (ACS) were identified in accordance with 19 CCR 2745.4.  \nThe WCS for the facility is assumed to be a catastrophic failure of the LNG storage tank, resulting in the release of the entire contents of the tank to the atmosphere.  The entire quantity is assumed to be released over a period of 10 minutes.  The release rate to the atmosphere is the quantity contained in the tank divided by the duration of the release.  The endpoint for an explosive chemical is defined in 19 CCR 2750.2(a)(4)(A) as the distance to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) due to a vapor cloud explosion.  \nThe selected ACS for the PG&E LNG Facility is a transfer hose failure due to a sudden hose uncoupling while transferring from the storage tank to the tanker truck.  LNG is released at a rate of 175 gallons per minute, which is the tra"

It encompasses time for the operator to realize what is occurring, travel to the control panel, and push the off button.  No passive or active mitigation measures present at the facility have been considered in the evaluation of the ACS.  This release scenario has been modeled as both as a vapor cloud fire and a pool fire to determine which type of scenario produces the most conservative results.  \nOf the two types of scenarios, the pool fire scenario provides the most conservative results for the ACS radius of influence.  Therefore, the radius of influence for this scenario has been used in determining the exposed population and public and environmental receptors for the ACS. \nPrevention Program\nThe LNG covered process is subject to Program 3 prevention program requirements because it is subject to OSHAA?s PSM standards and is not eligible for Program 1.  The PG&E Program 3 prevention program includes the following:\nA?    Process Safety Information;\nA?    Process Hazard Review;\nA?    Operating Procedures;\nA?    Training;\nA?    Mechanical Integrity;\nA?    Management of Change;\nA?    Pre-Startup Safety Review;\nA?    Compliance Audits;\nA?    Incident Investigations;\nA?    Employee Participation;\nA?    Hot Work Permit; and\nA?    Contractors.\nChemical specific prevention steps include the ESD system as described in Section 2.1.3\nThe LNG Facility was built to the design standard of NFPA 59A, which is specific to LNG.  In addition, the LNG tank was designed using Zone 4 seismic design standards, even though the facility is in Zone 3, for an added measure of safety.  \nBecause the SFD will be the responder in the event of an emergency incident involving an LNG fire detect, PG&E conducted a responder orientation exercise with the SFD on March 21, 2008, to familiarize SFD personnel with the facility and the hazards associated with LNG.\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have "

      "SummaryText": "been no CalARP RMP reportable releases at the LNG Facility in the past 5 years that resulted in either of the following:\nA?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\nA?    Known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\nEmergency Response Program\nPG&E has implemented an emergency response program (ERP) that complies with the requirements of the CalARP RMP as described in 19 CCR 2765.2.  This program contains a variety of information and procedures which describe how emergencies are handled.\nIncluded in the ERP is the emergency shutdown system (ESD) at the plant.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators and contractors are trained to activate the ESD by pushing one of the ESD buttons and to evacuate the area if appropriate.  ESD events which occur because of fire or gas detection signal the fire department approved fire panel to call an answering service for the facility, which in turn contacts PG&E employees.  In the event of a fire detection, the answering service also contacts the Sacramento Fire Department.  Manual ESD buttons do not signal the fire panel; since these will be activated only by personnel already on site, personnel will take the appropriate contact action and no answering service involvement is needed.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPG&E is in the process of resolving all of the action items identified in the October 2007 Process Hazard Analyses for each RMP-covered process.  A summary of the status of PHA action items for the facility is presented in Tables 4.2a and 4.2b in Section 4 of this RMP.\nIn the future, to ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain and improve safety, ongoing Process Hazard Reviews, Process Hazard Analyses, Training, Compliance Audits, inspection and maintenance, Contractor programs, Hot Work Permit issuance, and Incident Investigations will be conducted as required by the RMP.
