      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nPolicy Statement\nIt is the CWWs policy to operate safe water and wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the South Columbus WRF.\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities\nMunicipal wastewater treatment.\nUse of Regulated Substances\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling of biosolids in the clarification process.\nSulfur dioxide is used in the dechlorination process to remove residual chlorine from the treated water prior to discharge.\nDigester gas is a by-product of anaerobic digestion, which is a process used to reduce the volume of excess biosolids produced during wastewater treatment.  The digester gas is flammable because it contains 65 percent by volume of methane, a flammable gas.  The quantity of digester gas stored is 1,600 pounds, which is below the threshold quantity for regulation under the RMP Rule.  Therefore, it is not included in the Risk Management Plan.\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine:  \nTotal Amount Stored:  20 one-ton containers, equivalent to 40,000 pounds.\nSulfur Dioxide:\nTotal Amount Stored:  18 one-ton containers, equivalent to 36,000 pounds.\nDigester Gas: \n1,600 pounds (estimation based on the anaerobic digester dimensions).\n\nThe South Columbus WRF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as of administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule"

      "SummaryText": ".  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a What-If analysis.\nFive-year Accident History\nThe South Columbus WRF has never had a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide resulting in offsite injury or dispersion, or in onsite injury.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe CWW has implemented an Emergency Response Program that applies to the South Columbus WRF, which coordinates response efforts with the local fire departments Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Georgia Emergency Management Office.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the South Columbus WRF has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems.  The following recommendations for improving the safety of the chlorination and dechlorination processes were made during the most recent hazard review:\n1. Replace Ball valves on the South Columbus Water Resource Facility (SCWRF) chlorine manifolds;  \n2. Replace valves on the Sulfur Dioxide Manifold;   \n3. New Chlorine Pamphlet 155 has been released by CI.  This should be distributed to all on the Response Team and all new operators, training to be conducted June 9-12, 2009;\n4.  Require the Monorail Hoist for unloading Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide be inspected by third party Hoist Inspection Firm;  Require hoist inspections that adhere to ANSI and OSHA requirements\n5.  Require a formal tracking system be instituted at SCWRF to track delivery of any defective chemical cylinders and an ammonia/air test on all valves is done to detect leakers before unloading, since a new chlorine supplier has been awarded the contract starting in July 2009;\n6.  Requires SCWRF to add Ft Benning be added to Emergency Notification protocol for Chemical leaks which may require off site notification; \n7. Plant Manager should evaluate methods to maintai"
