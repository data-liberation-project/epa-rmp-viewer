      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n1. Prevention and Response Policies\n1.1 OMI believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment. Accordingly, OMI has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support. This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Tupelo WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Tupelo WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements. By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n1.2 The RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule. Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals. If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur. Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n1.3 OMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Tupelo WWTP) and actively participated in comprehensive process hazard analyses. The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals. They ar"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Tupelo WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n1.5 As for emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n2.1 The Tupelo WWTP is located at 2062 international Drive in Tupelo, Lee County, Mississippi. The Tupelo WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations. OMI operates the City of Tupelo?s two-stage activated sludge wastewater treatment plant consisting of rectangle clarifiers, with traveling bridges. The project also operates and maintains 52 lift stations and various lagoons throughout the county. The plant is designed to treat an average daily flow (sanitary sewer) of 10.5 MGD, and a peak average daily flow of 12 MGD.\n2.2 The Tupelo WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six containers (12,000 pounds) on site. In addition, the Tupelo WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent. The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of four containers (8,000 pounds) on site. Therefore, the Tupelo WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\n3. Prevention Steps for Chlorine\n3.1 The prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Tupelo WWTP RMP manual. The prevention program includes the following elements:\n3"

Accident History\n5.1 Within the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n6. Emergency Response Program\n6.1 This facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Tupelo Fire Department. The program is described in detail in the Tupelo WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation. The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n7. Planned Changes for Improved Safety\n7.1 Ideas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Tupelo WWTP. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n7.2 As part of the development of the Tupelo WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements. During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered. The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."
