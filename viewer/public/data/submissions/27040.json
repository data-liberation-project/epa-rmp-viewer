Box 310  Shelby, NE  68662     \nMailing Address\n\nRisk Management Plan-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilitied are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we ae prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments promarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators,\" however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage.\"  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under condideration as a listed substance.  We include propane (as well as all crop protectants and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year little if anyh product transfer occurs.  The maximum quantity stored"

      "SummaryText": " in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is 460,000 Lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 26,000 Gallons, storing 110,000 Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operatied on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these need s do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full-time employee\" on dite, therefore item number 1.11 is zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various tiems of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nthe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 110,000 Lbs. Based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.6 miles based on EPA's RMP Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual, and self-closing excess flow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment.)  the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06 miles (317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is bas"
