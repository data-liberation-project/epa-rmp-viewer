This includes compliance with EPA\u0092s Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68). Chem Tech is an adhesive manufacturing facility that utilizes AB80 (propane/butane mixture) in aerosol products. The AB80 covered process at Chem Tech consists of the storage of AB80 in a 18,000-gal capacity horizontal pressure vessel (bulk tank) located on the rear of the facility property and is dispensed into five mobile cylinders (100-gal tanks) to be used in the aerosol production process. One 100-gal tank is the largest capacity Chem Tech has connected to the building/aerosol production line at a time.  \nThe Risk Management Plan along with other safety and environmental programs already in-place enables Chem Tech to prevent the occurrence of fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents associated with AB80 storage and transfer. The emergency response plan is designed to minimize AB80 releases and potential for explosion or fire through prompt mitigation actions and immediate notification to the local fire department and outside emergency responders. \n\n2.\tGeneral Prevention Program and Rules/Regulations\nAB80 components (propane and butane) are flammable substances listed in the Part 68 rule. AB80 is stored in a quantity that exceeds its components\u0092 threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds under both the EPA RMP rule and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Thus, propellant storage and filling of aerosol product is subject to both rules and the requirement for having RMP and PSM programs. As such, the AB80 process at Chem Tech meets the criteria for a Program Level 3 process as specified in the RMP rules. \nThe AB80 bulk tank was designed and constructed per industry standards for pressure vessels and following good engineering practices.

Additionally, unique site-specific issues were evaluated to ensure that all potential hazards of the AB80 were thoroughly reviewed.\nWritten operating procedures for AB80 delivery, storage, handling, and transfer are in place. All persons working with AB80 equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures. An Inspection, Testing, and Preventative Maintenance Program (ITPM) was created and is maintained to ensure the integrity of the process equipment.\n\n3.\tFive Year Accident History\nNo accidents involving AB80 have occurred in the last five years. \n\n4.\tEmergency Response Program\nChem Tech maintains a written emergency response plan that employees are regularly trained on. The plan is coordinated with the Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Bristol Fire Department. The emergency response plan includes procedures for stopping/mitigating release of AB80, if deemed safe to do so, and immediate notification to outside emergency responders. The Compliance Coordinator at Chem Tech has been a member of the Elkhart County LEPC since October 2022 and is the current vice chair of the Elkhart County LEPC. Chem Tech has conducted tabletop and drill exercises for emergency evacuation internally and before the end of 2024 will conduct a tabletop exercise of Chem Tech\u0092s emergency response plan with local emergency responders. \n\n5.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nChem Tech has addressed the recommendations from the initial PHA as well as the PHA conducted in 2023, with only one recommendation outstanding at the time of this submission. The final recommendation is set to be completed by the end of 2024. The final recommendation will upgrade the gas monitoring system currently installed o"
