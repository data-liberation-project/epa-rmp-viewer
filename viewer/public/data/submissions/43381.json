The properties of both materials require safe handling in order to prevent human exposure to the facility's workers and nearby community personnel. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.                                       2.Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The facility treats surface water obtained from reservoirs for municipal and industrial uses. This water is disinfected by mixing chlorine gas and water. Liquid chlorine is stored on site in one of two 60-ton bulk storage tanks located in the Chlorine Storage Building. One storage tank is kept empty to accept emergency chlorine transfer from the operating tank. Chlorine gas from the on-line container is piped into the chlorinators at several locations with the facility: 1)to the plant effluent at two locations, the East Roseville influent junction box and the North Roseville headworks, for odor control; 2) to the return activated sludge to control filamentous growth; 3) at the secondary clarifier weirs for algae growth; 4) to the filters to control algae growth; 5) and at two locations in the chlorine contact tank to disinfect either Title 22 or non-Title 22 water.                                                                                                                                                                           There is a daily maximum of 13, 125 gallons of chlorine at the facility.                                                                                 The excess chlorine residual is dechlorinated prior to discharge using sulfur dioxide. Li"

      "SummaryText": "quid sulfur dioxide is stored in one of two 20-ton steel bulk storage tanks situated in the Sulfur Dioxide Storage Building. One storage tank is kept empty to accept emergency sulfur dioxide transfer from the operating tank. Each 5,600 gallon bulk storage tank has a liquid withdrawl pipe connected to the sulfur dioxide evaporators; a gas withdrawl pipe connected to both the manual and electric vacuum regulator-check units; an air padding/vapor recovery pipe connected to the air padding compressed air system and to the truck unloading station; and a fill pipe connected to the truck unloading station. Sulfur dioxide gas can be released from the bulk tank to two sulfonators where the gas is monitored and drawn by vacuum to five injectors. One of the sulfonators is standby; the other regulates the flow of sulfur dioxide gas (under vacuum) to a remote injector on the effluent line. From the injectors, sulfur dioxide solution is routed to its point of use.

Worst Case Scenario: The 60-ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the chlorine feed system. Failure of this container will release 120,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the chlorine gas would be released at the rate of 12,000 pounds per minute for 10 minutes. The 60-ton container is stored inside of a building but the assumption is made that the gas release from the 60-ton container is directly to the surrounding atmosphere external to the building.

Alternative Release Scenario: The Alternative Release scenario for both the 60-ton container of chlorine and the 20-ton container of sulfur dioxide is the failure of the plant operator to properly connect the hose to the pump truck during loading of the container and/or failure of the truck or plant operator to properly close the fill valves prior to disconnecting the hose.
