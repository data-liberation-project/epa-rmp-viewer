Administrative Controls: Administrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide released should a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system. Training is provided to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide operators.                                                                                                                                                                         3d.

The 20-ton container of sulfur dioxide is the largest vessel in the sulfur dioxide feed system. Failure of this container will release 40,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. It is assumed that the sulfur dioxide would be released at the rate of 4,000  pounds per minute for 10 minutes. The 20-ton container is stored inside of a building but the assumption is made that the gas release from the 20-ton container is directly to the surrounding atmosphere external to the building.

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: This facility handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous materials. The properties of both materials require safe handling in order to prevent human exposure to the facility's workers and nearby community personnel. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.                                       2.Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The facility treats surface water obtained from reservoirs for municipal and industrial uses. This water is disinfected by mixing chlorine gas and water. Liquid chlorine is stored on site in one of two 60-ton bulk storage tanks located in the Chlorine Storage Building. One storage tank is kept empty to accept emergency chlorine transfer from the operating tank. Chlorine gas from the on-line container is piped into the chlorinators at several locations with the facility: 1)to the plant effluent at two locations, the East Roseville influent junction box and the North Roseville headworks, for odor control; 2) to the return activated sludge to control filamentous growth; 3) at the secondary clarifier weirs for algae growth; 4) to the filters to control algae growth; 5) and at two locations in the chlorine contact tank to disinfect either Title 22 or non-Title 22 water.

One storage tank is kept empty to accept emergency sulfur dioxide transfer from the operating tank.

Sulfur dioxide gas can be released from the bulk tank to two sulfonators where the gas is monitored and drawn by vacuum to five injectors. One of the sulfonators is standby; the other regulates the flow of sulfur dioxide gas (under vacuum) to a remote injector on the effluent line.
