Headquartered in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, DOT is a family owned business that has grown from a single station wagon driven by the founder, Robert Tracy, to a fleet of over 400 multi-temp tractor trailers. This growth is in large part due to the customer driven attitude that is exhibited by all the members of the Dot team.  As stated on their website,  Dot Foods will continue to be driven by the values of integrity, growth, profit, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on innovation and employee welfare.\n\nDOT Foods' senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  DOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1990.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 1120 W. North St., Vidalia, Georgia 30474.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 16,000 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the ma"

Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or outside on the roof above the machine room (condensers and Thermosyphon Receiver).\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nThere are ammonia and temperature sensors placed in strategic locations in the freezer, cooler, and dock areas.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds and a visible alarm is triggered.  Ammonia sensors are located throughout the facility in the Machine Room, Dock Area, Cooler Areas, and Freezer Area.  These sensors are tied to a central computer that alarms and calls an outside alarm company.  The alarm will activate at one set concentration level.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods' facility accident history during the Five-Year Revalidation, revealed that there have been no reportable ammonia related accidents, incidents or releases at the facility over the past five years (May 1999 - May 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDOT Foods has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.
