Out of\n\nthese facilities only three (3)the two (2) wastewater\n\ntreatment facilities and three (3) water treatment\n\nfacilities use chlorine gas for disinfection and of these\n\nthree (3) only one (1) meets the reporting threshold, all\n\nother facilities have been converted to Sodium Hypochlorite.\n\nThe County employs a single two (2) types of vacuum systems\n\nfor the injection of chlorine into water and wastewater --\n\nvacuum feed. The typical process includes the Chlorine\n\nSupply and distribution system from the ton and 150-lb.\n\ncylinders up to the point the chlorine solution is dispersed\n\ninto the Contact chamber where the chlorine is dissolved. At\n\nthis point the potential for a release of highly hazardous\n\nmaterial as defined by OSHA is no longer a concern. A vacuum\n\nfeed system uses an automatic switchover connection so that\n\nup to four twelve (12) cylinders is 'on-line' (six feeding\n\nand six on standby)  at  a time. When the chlorine is\n\ndepleted from the cylinders on one side of the switchover\n\nconnection the vacuum draw is automatically switched over to\n\ndraw chlorine gas from the other side. At this time the\n\nempty cylinders can be replaced. In this way, chlorine is\n\ncontinuously available to the solution feed system. A vacuum\n\nfeed system has added safety since the exposed piping from\n\nthe cylinder to the flow proportional chlorinator is under a\n\nvacuum and will not allow the release of chlorine in the\n\nevent of a leak in this piping.\n\n\n\nIn a vacuum system chlorine gas is drawn under vacuum from a\n\npressurized cylinder containing a combination of pure\n\nchlorine liquid and chlorine gas through a solution feeder,\n\nwhich controls the rate of application. The injector in the\n\nchlorine feed system dissolves chlorine gas into water,\n\nwh"

Monitoring the residual prior to\n\nexiting the plant allows for minor adjustments to control\n\nchlorine addition through the flow-proportional chlorinator.\n\nThe second type of vacuum system the county uses is for when\n\nlarge amounts of chlorine are required; containers can be\n\nconnected to a manifold with flexible copper connections. In\n\nthis arrangement, the vacuum regulator is attached to the\n\nmanifold instead of directly to the tank. Seminole County\n\nhas only one site that requires this type of connection.\n\n\n\nChlorine storage and Handling:\n\nTo provide chlorine for disinfection of water and\n\nwastewater, Seminole County uses chlorine gas at five three\n\n(3) facilities. Chlorine gas is stored in one-ton or 150 lb.\n\ncylinders. One-ton chlorine gas cylinder rest on trunnions,\n\nwhich are secured to the floor and allow easy rotation of\n\nthe containers to correctly position the outlet valves. The\n\n150 lb. cylinders are stored standing upright and secured to\n\nthe wall. One ton gas/liquid chlorine containers are\n\nfabricated to DOT specifications as large steel welded tanks\n\nor cylinders. The average one-ton container is about 30\n\ninches in outside diameter and about 82 inches in length.\n\nAverage tare weight is 1500 pounds; average gross weight is\n\nabout 3,500 pounds, leaving 2,000 pounds net weight. Each\n\nend of a ton container is concave, with one end equipped\n\nwith two valves protected by removable bonnet housing.  The\n\nvalves are connected to education pipes located inside the\n\ncontainer. The valves must be aligned vertically so that the\n\nupper valve is used to withdraw gaseous chlorine from above\n\nthe liquid level in the container. The lower valve is for\n\nliquid withdrawa"

The\n\ninternal pressure of the container is equal to the vapor\n\npressure of liquid chlorine, which varies with ambient\n\ntemperature. A container exposed to ambient temperatures of\n\n0'F to100'F will have an internal pressure ranging from 14\n\npsig. to 143 psig. In the event of a fire or overheating, at\n\na temperature of about 160'F and a resulting vapor pressure\n\nof approximately 320 psig, the fusible plugs will melt and\n\nrelease the contents of the container to the atmosphere. The\n\nDOT hydrostatic pressure specification of the container is\n\n500 psig.  One-ton cylinders are too large and heavy to be\n\nmoved by hand. Therefore chlorine storage rooms for these\n\ncylinders are equipped with two-ton hoists. Moving full\n\ncylinders exposes the area to the potential for a large-\n\nscale chlorine leak.
