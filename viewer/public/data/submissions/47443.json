      "SummaryText": "This document contains all required information in order to meet 40 CFR 68 \u00bfRisk Management Program\u00bf.  This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Butterball facility in Ozark, Arkansas has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has a thorough preventative maintenance program.  More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Planning and Response program to ensure the safety of its employees\u00bf, the community, and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release \u00bf HAZMAT Team.  As part of this program, there is emergency response training and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  All of these components make the Emergency Action and Response Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the Butterball facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nButterball kills, eviscerates, and packs whole turkeys. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311615.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products. Butterball has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The facility has the capacity to hold"

      "SummaryText": "32,500 pounds; however written policy limits storage to 80% of total capacity.  Therefore, the total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is approximately 26,000 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n \n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.\tEye contact\n\nBelow is a description of the release scenarios for ammonia and their off-site consequences:\n\t\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nButterball has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At Butterball, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which"

      "SummaryText": "is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Butterball's PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are being implemented for the RMP document.  \n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of Butterball's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 1999 \u00bf June 21, 2004.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.  \n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Butterball facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response document called Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe program describes procedures for the response to hazardous substances, spills and releases.  The plan contains specific information about:  HAZMAT emergency response; pre-emergency planning; roles and lines of authority; HAZMAT roles; emergency recognition and prevention; emergency team job descriptions; decontamination; safe distances and places of refuge; emergency alerting and response procedures for ammonia release; critique of response and follow-up; standard operator procedures for HAZMAT response; and annual refresher training.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan also consists of all notifications and plant evacuation procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  The purpose of this plan is to summarize the existing policies, procedures, and plans of action to protect the team members of this facility from dangers associated with these emergencies and provide for the notification and proper evacuation of plant personnel in event of an emergency.\n\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished."
