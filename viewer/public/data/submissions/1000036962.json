      "SummaryText": "The Caterpillar Inc. - Joliet facility located at 2200 Channahon Road in Joliet, Illinois (\"Facility\") operates a stationary source in accordance with a CAAPP permit (I.D.No.197809AAC). This stationary source includes one (1) covered process consisting of four (4) interconnected propylene aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) with a maximum capacity of 29,000 pounds. The four (4) ASTs are interconnected and located approximately 115 feet east of the southeast corner of Building B. Propylene is stored as a liquid under pressure. The propylene is vaporized and utilized as a fuel in the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) Thermal Spray Systems that apply chrome-nickel coating on metal parts used in the manufacture of various types of heavy-duty, off-road equipment.\r\n\r\nThere have been no serious accidental releases from the four (4) existing propylene ASTs during the past five (5) years after the Facility began using propylene as a fuel in the HVOF process.\r\n\r\nThe Facility's existing Disaster Plan, revised in April 2013, covers emergency response policies and procedures in the event of a disaster, such as an explosion, at the Facility.\r\n\r\nThe propylene ASTs sit on a concrete platform and are surrounded by safety bollards to prevent any potential damage from motor vehicles."
