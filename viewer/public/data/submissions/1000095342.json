      "SummaryText": "The Risk Management Plan (RMP) update has been prepared relating to the storage, handling and use of chlorine at the East Rio Hondo Water Supply Corporation's (ERHWSC) Nelson Road Water Treatment Facility (\"facility\") located at the intersection of Nelson Rd and Line 20 Rd, approximately four miles to the south-southeast of downtown Rio Hondo in Cameron County, Texas.  The RMP meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements for Prevention Program Level 3 (40 CFR 68) facilities and the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119). \r\n\r\nThe facility is located in a primarily rural area of Cameron County, Texas.  Properties adjacent to the plant include agricultural lands to the west, east and south.  Surrounding properties are primarily agricultural; however, four (4) residences are located adjacent to and immediately north of the plant, and one residence is located to the east of the plant, beyond Nelson Rd and an irrigation canal.  The approximate coordinates of the chlorine storage area are: \r\n\r\nLatitude:\tN 26.179319\r\nLongitude:\tW -97.566667\r\n  \r\nThe facility is stationary and maintains an inventory of chlorine that exceeds 2,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nGeneral information includes the following:\r\n\r\nProcess chemical:\t\t\tChlorine \r\nCAS number:\t\t\t\t7782-50-5\r\nTotal inventory:\t\t\t6,000 pounds\r\nNAICS code:\t\t\t\t22131:   Water Supply and Irrigation Systems\r\nStorage:\t\t\t\tThree one-ton containers in a sheltered area (i.e., enclosed space in direct contact with outside air)\r\n\r\nMr. Eric Haydon, Operations Manager and Safety Director, is responsible for the implementation of the Risk Management Plan and the Process Safety Management.\r\n\r\nThe facility's accidental release prevention policy integrates technologies, procedures, and good management practices.

The policy adheres to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR 68 Prevention Program procedures and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program regulations.\r\n\r\nRMP regulations for Program Level 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of chlorine to the air from the largest container stored on site (2000 pounds). The worst-case chlorine release rate estimated at 200 pounds per minute.  The modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 ppm), due to a 10-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine, is 2.2 miles. \r\n\r\nClean Air Act regulations require that the alternative release scenario selection is more probable than the worst-case scenario. The scenario selected involves a seal failure or vessel puncture. This could be the result of a mechanical failure, operator error or severe weather conditions such as a hurricane or tornado. This failure results in the release of the entire container's contents over a period of 30 minutes. The modeling results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 ppm), because of a 40-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine, is 0.3 miles. \r\n\r\nThe facility must prepare a five-year accident history in its RMP to assist in the prevention of future accidents. There have been no reportable accidents at the facility in the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program Level 3 requireme"
