All applicable procedures of the ANSI K-61.1 - 1989 revision of the \"Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\" as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a capacity of 30,000 gallons water capacity.  One storage tank, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 131,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off site consequences were calculated using Degadis.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class.  An urban topography was sel"

It is estimated that 425 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 7,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urban topography and Degadis, the toxic endpoint is .1 mile.  The population within that area is estimated to be 50 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nRyan Cooperative had a spill on December 27, 2003 due to a theft.  The local Fire Department and Sheriff's office was called and responded.  This release was at the nurse tank storage lot on Union Street.  There was a 1 1/2\" rubber hose slid over the liquid withdraw valve on the front of the tank.  The hose was left handing over the front of the tank and the valve left open.  The valve was open approximately 1 1/4 turns.  Responders used SCBA to approach the tank and shut off the valve.\n\nRyan Cooperative has several key elements in it's accident prevention plan:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the IDALS which bases those regulations on the 1989 revision of the ANSI K61.1 adopted in 1990 by the State of Iowa.\n2. Annual training of all personnel handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training  covers properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3. Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n4. Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n5. Annual inspections by IDALS fertilizer inspectors.\n6. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations"
