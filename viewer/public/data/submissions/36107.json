      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt the Clariant Coventry Plant, we are dedicated to protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as the environment at our site and in our community. To help ensure the safety of our employees and our community neighbors, we have an accidental release prevention program and an emergency response program.  This document provides a brief overview of our facility and of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00bfA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation\n\u00bfAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\u00bfA five-year accident history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule\n\u00bfAn overview of our emergency response program\n\u00bfAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees and community neighbors and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nClariant Corporation is a specialty chemical company with headquarters in Muttenz, Switzerland and operating worldwide with more than 100 companies on five continents.  Clariant is one of the global leaders in specialty chemicals and the Coventry Site is one of Clariant\u00bfs primary manufacturing locations in the United States.\n\nClariant's assets at the Coventry Site include production buildings, site infrastructure including a boiler house and a wastewater treatment plant, laboratories, warehouses, and an administration building.  Coventry Site employees include approximately 255 Clariant employees and 30 contract maintenance and security personnel.  The Coventry Site produces pigments, pigment and dye intermediates, and specialty chemicals using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Our pigment products are used in the coloration of house paint, automotive and industrial coatings, plastics f"

Our accident prevention program and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Coventry Site complies with all EPA and OSHA accident prevention requirements at 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.  We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention planning programs including:\n\nProcess safety information\nProcess hazard analysis\nOperating procedures\nTraining\nMechanical integrity\nManagement of change\nPre-start-up review\nCompliance audits\nIncident investigation\nEmployee participation\nHot work permit\nContractors\n\nThese individual elements work together to ensure that sufficient layers of protection exist through technology, facilities, and personnel to prevent escalation from a single failure to a catastrophic event.\n\nAs part of our prevention plan efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nBoth the bromine and sulfur trioxide storage tanks are located in dikes designed to contain a release and both tanks are located inside buildings.  As a result of these two passive mitigation measures, the amount of vapor released to the atmosphere in the event of a worst-case type release is reduced by over 99.5%.\n\nUnloading of bromine and sulfur trioxide occur in"

      "SummaryText": "truck bays with sumps to contain a release.  In the event of a release of either bromine or sulfur trioxide in the unloading bays, response systems are available to cover the release and minimize vaporization.  The bromine bay is equipped with a manually activated water or foam spray; and dry chemical units, for use by the Emergency Response Team, are located near the sulfur trioxide bay.\n\nSensors are used in the bromine and sulfur trioxide storage buildings and in the bromine processing area to detect small leaks.  Tripped sensors automatically shut off the feed pumps to help prevent further release.\n\nProcess control systems with interlocks, alarms, and automatic shutoffs are used in both the bromine and sulfur trioxide processing areas.  Manual shutoffs are also available in the processing areas as well as both storage buildings and truck unloading bays.\n\nAny pressure vessel containing bromine or sulfur trioxide is equipped with relief devices to prevent catastrophic over pressurization.  Normal process venting from receipt, storage, and usage of bromine and sulfur trioxide is through scrubbers designed and permitted to handle the emissions.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Coventry Site keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  We have not had a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in on-site injury or off-site impact during the past five years and have had no such release for nearly 13 years.\n\nWe have a comprehensive incident investigation program.  For all incidents and near miss incidents, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.  The employee success sharing annual bonus is currently based in part on the identification and correction of root causes of incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Coventry Site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and, local regulat"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  Additionally, the Coventry Site has hosted community drills with local community responders.\n\nWe have a 24-hour Emergency Response Team (ERT) with more than 20 members trained in emergency response, incipient stage firefighting, and hazardous materials requirements.  Several ERT members are certified Emergency Medical Technicians.  Training requirements are rigorous and all members must pass a physical exam.  The site has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability, and sprinkler systems.  We also maintain an emergency response vehicle equipped with air monitoring, radio and cellular phone systems, and emergency response and decontamination materials.\n\nThe Coventry Site has an established partnership with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire departments.  An automated telephone Community Alert Network (CAN) and neighbor hotline are used to notify neighbors of a site emergency and actions to be taken.\n\nOUR GOAL:  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\n\nAt Clariant, we are committed to continuous improvement of Environment, Health, and Safety performance.  Through our Process Safety Management program, we review hazards associated with our processes and implement actions to reduce the hazards according to risk assessment/risk management principles."
