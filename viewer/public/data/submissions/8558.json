The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1955 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to it's current size through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. This particular facility was established in 1994.\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia. Our commitment to the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP) provides our company with an integrated health and safety, environmental, and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities.

      "SummaryText": "es and community neighbors. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia. We are not a manufacturer. The material is transported to our facility by rail car and then transferred from the rail car to our transport cargo tanks for bulk distribution to the end-users of the material.\n\nThe potential maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored at this facility on any particular day is 336,000 pounds. It is only on rare occasions when these potential storage quantities are actually achieved. Each storage vessel is limited by federal regulation to 85% of the maximum volume of the storage vessel. The maximum quantity handled at any particular time would occur during the transfer from a railcar to a transport cargo tank and that quantity is 20,000 pounds.\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an \"ozone safe\" refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be \"auto-repulsive\". These  characteristics provide us with an earl"

These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Material Safety Data Sheets, wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training programs as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nSafety Improvement Process:\n\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.  Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance. Each facility has an individual safety committee comprised of site employees and management. These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well as at our customer facilities. The management representatives of the site specific committee report directly to the corporate safety committee. The corporate safety committee is comprised of upper management, compliance personnel and headquarters employees that are familiar with plant processes. This committee meets on a regular basis to review accident and injury investigations, evaluate site specific issues, provide recommendations and implementation guidance.  Also, qualified personnel periodically inspect and evaluate each facility to assess safety and maintenance conditions. The results of these facility inspections are reported directly to upper management and the operations department. As a whole, these systems provide Tanner Industries, Inc. with a continuous process for the identification of safety improvement opportunities thus reducing any risk to our society associated with a release of this important chemical.\n\nWhat Tanner Industrie"

Off-site receptors have been identified using \"LandView III\" software developed by the US Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario\nTanner Industries, Inc considered a 160,000 pound release of anhydrous ammonia as the worst case scenario. The release event resulted from the entire contents of the largest vessel, in this case a railcar, emptying in 10 minutes. Since ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, the release would result in a dual-phase flow. Dual-phase flow means that the material would simultaneously flow as a gas and a liquid and then vaporize into a gas. The dual-phase flow was automatically considered by the software for this scenario. Liquid ammonia spills also undergo a phenomenon known as \"auto-refrigeration\". This is an effect that is demonstrated by a decrease in the internal temperature of an ammonia pool due to vaporization. This characteristic essentially decreases the vaporization rate of an ammonia pool. Thus, the vapor cloud from a liquid release would diminish over time and the endpoint would be dynamic. An increased effect could be expected if the release were to occur within an area that limited the exposed surface of the pool. Neither the  auto-refrigeration property of ammonia or any other mitigating factors were a consideration used in this scenario. \n\nThe off-site area impacted by the release could experience ammonia concentrations of 200 parts per million (ppm).

We selected a release amount of 150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is 150% of the maximum amount released at any of our facilities based on our five year accident history. We applied this conservative scenario to all of our facilities for the following reasons:\n   a) All of our facilities store and handle anhydrous ammonia.\n   b) All of our facilities use the same basic processes in their operation.\n   c) The potential for this amount to be released at any of our facilities does exist.\n   d) Some of our facilities do not have a history of accidental releases.\nThe scenario was performed considering the total 150 pounds of ammonia released as a gas.

Please refer Section 3, Alternative Case Release Scenario of the Risk Management Plan for further information.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no unintentional releases of ammonia at the Tanner Industries, Inc., Kenova, WV.,  facility in the past five years that meet the US EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) defined reporting requirements.\n\nThe following is a list of all unintentional ammonia releases at our facility that have been reported to federal, state and local authorities in the past five years under the requirements of US Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III, Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA).  None of these releases, to our knowledge, resulted in any adverse impacts to the community, the environment or our employees.\n  \nQuantity Released (Ammonia)     1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     1999 (1st Qtr.)\nGreater than 1,000 pounds            0            0           0           0"
