      "SummaryText": "Wemlinger Water Purification Facility treats drinking water for Aurora's citizens.  For pathogen free water and to meet regulations, chlorine is used for disinfection.  Chlorine is reliable, powerful, and cost effective when kept in the pipe, in the process, and/or in the water.  Recently, Wemlinger installed automatic closers to our safety system, which added another layer of prevention against chlorine releases.  Wemlinger's approach to safety is based on water industry regulations and standards.  \n\n\n\nThe Wemlinger WPF was constructed in 1983.  Wemlinger was the second (of three) Aurora water treatment plants built and is designed to contribute high quality water to the citizens of Aurora.  The facility has undergone two major construction projects for capacity expansion and facility improvements, in 1987 and 2003.  During the 2003 rehabilitation of the Wemlinger WPF, significant improvements for the chlorine and other chemical systems were completed.  In 2010 and 2012, important new safeguards, nitrogen purge and ton container automatic closers, were incorporated into the chlorine system. \n\n\n\nSafety is integral to Wemlinger's practices when it comes to working with chlorine.  Safeguards on the system include air monitoring, ton container auto closers, pressure and temperature monitors, video observation, explosion resistant entries, restricted access entrances, and multiple daily checks by the operations staff.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Federal Code of Regulations, Chapter 68, Sections 48 through 60, under Section 112* of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the facility has established a Program 2 Prevention Program as part of the Risk Management Program and Plan.  The overall goal of the program and plan is to reduce the risk of injury or death from accidental release of chemicals to employees, to the public, or to the environment. \n\nRequirements for the Program 2 Prevention Program include:  \n\n\n\nSafety Information                 Hazard Review                        \n\nOperating Procedure"

The accident free status of the past 5 years and the prior year's reflect Wemlinger's commitment to safety.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response System is integrated with Aurora Water Treatment's overall safety mission and developed in accordance with 40 CFR ?68.95.  The ERP includes the following elements:  \n\n1]  Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n\n2]  Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures.\n\n3]  Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n4]  Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance\n\n5]  Training for all employees in relevant procedures, and;\n\n6]  Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the ERP to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that      employees are informed of changes.  \n\n \n\nSafety improvements currently revolve around training.  The most vital change has been going to an on-line program.\n\n"
