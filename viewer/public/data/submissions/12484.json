Freeport plant, we are committed to operating and to maintaining our process in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, we have established a Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP rule).  One element of the RMP rule is a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) which details accident prevention measures and safeguards.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs are vital to ensure the safety of our employees, the community and the environment.  The Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals L. P. Freeport plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances we use.  In the event of a significant accidental release, trained responders will act to control and contain the release.  We work with the local emergency response organizations to evaluate potential releases and to formulate appropriate responses to contain and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of such a release.  Nalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals L. P., in conjunction with the local emergency planning and response organizations, has established a means to warn the surrounding communities in the event of a release which would threaten the public.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNalco/Exxon Energy Chemicals operates a manufacturing facility at the Freeport site in Brazoria County, Texas.  This batch-process facility produces a wide variety of materials for use in oil field and water treatment applications. Ethylene Ox"

In our oxyalkylation process, Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are the only RMP regulated chemicals that are present above the EPA threshold quantity.

Also, for the purpose of this RMPlan, the use of EO and PO is considered as one process for our site:\n\nProgram Level    Regulated Substance    Type    Process Inventory\n3    Ethylene Oxide    Toxic    265,000 Pounds\n3    Propylene Oxide    Toxic    260,000 Pounds\n\nNote:  The Process Inventories for EO and PO are based on inventory management controls.  The storage tanks are equipped with interlocks to maintain levels below 90% capacity (approx. 260,000 lbs.).\n\n\n \n3. Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe following are brief summaries of the Worst-Case and Alternate Release scenarios for our facility, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nEthylene Oxide: \n     Rupture of a full rail car, releasing 170,000 pounds of EO in 10 minutes, potentially resulting in an offsite impact.\n\nPropylene Oxide: \n     Rupture of a full rail car, releasing 170,000 pounds of PO in instantaneously, potentially resulting in an offsite impact.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios for Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios for Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nEthylene Oxide: \n    A gasket leak on a 2 in. unloading hose, releasing 9,600 pounds of EO in 10 minutes, potentially resulting in an offsite impact. \n\nPropylene Oxide:\n    A gasket leak on a 2 in. unloading hose, releasing 9,400 pounds of PO in 10 minutes, potentially resulting in an offsite impact.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios for Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nNot Applicable\n\nKey Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures for Above Sc"

      "SummaryText": "ident History\n\nIn the past five years, our facility has not had any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or offsite or any evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nOur facility maintains an emergency response and contingency plan, which meets all of the federal, state and local regulatory requirements and is communicated to all employees.  This plan and the emergency response training for site personnel provide protection for our employees, the public and the environment.  \n\nRepresentatives of our facility are active members of Brazosport's Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group, the Brazoria County Petrochemical Council (BCPC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Brazosport Emergency Planning Committee (BEPC).  All of these groups work to improve the communication between the chemical companies about emergency response and mitigation.  Furthermore, we share information to better enable us to protect our workers, communities and environment and to prevent accidental releases.\n\nRegular drills involving on site emergency responders, the local fire department and the local industrial mutual aid team are conducted.  These drills are based on scenarios of fires, explosions and/or toxic releases and may involve any or all of the above response organizations.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following improvements were identified during initial Process Hazard analyses at our facility: \n\nImprovements already completed include:\n\n1) Review of relief systems for adequacy and change as necessary to handle worst emergency case.\n2) Addition of more alarms and review of set points of existing alarms for adequacy.\n3) Addition of more instrumentation to better monitor process conditions at more points along the process train.\n4) Installation of backflow prevention measures to avert hazardous contamination or mixing o"
