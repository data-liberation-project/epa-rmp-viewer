              "Description": "Sodium Hydrosulfite Plant - Clariant Operations:\n\nCelanese operates three plants on site that are owned by Clariant Corporation.  Celanese provides operations personnel, management, and safety management for these plants, in accordance with Celanese plant policies.  The plants include:\n\n1.  Sodium Hydrosulfite Plant\n2.  Sulfur Dioxide Plant\n3.  Sodium Bisulfite Plant\n\nEach of these units include a common RMP listed chemical, sulfur dioxide (SO2).  There are three separate storage areas for SO2 on site:\n\n1.  A receiver vessel and a storage tank within the SO2 plant.\n2.  A satellite storage area at the rail loading facility, which includes five storage tanks.  The sodium hydrosulfite and sodium bisulfite plants use SO2 from these storage tanks but most commonly use a single tank designated for plant use.\n3.  The site can also store SO2 in railcars, in the rail yard, while they are awaiting shipment.\n\nRMP specific to SO2:\n\nThe SO2 storage areas are equipped with SO2 gas detectors.  The detectors are arranged around the piping and loading areas.  The gas detectors are tested as part of a maintenance program.  The gas detectors have two levels of operation.  The first level of gas detection senses exposure levels above the 8 hour TWA.  When this occurs an alarm is sounded and operator intervention corrects the leak.  The second level of operation detects a higher concentration which activates an automatic shutoff of loading operations.  Operation personnel then follow appropriate actions to find and correct the leak.\n\nThere is a truck loading area for SO2 in the storage area at the SO2 plant.  There is a railcar and truck loading area in the satellite storage area.  Both of these areas are monitored with video surveillance cameras from the SO2 plant control room.  The operator has the ability to zoom and pan the camera to look at specific pieces of equipment.  This gives the operator an extra set of eyes to spot potential leak problems.\n\nWater is effective in absorbing SO2 gas and is effective in removing SO2 vapors from the air.  Fire water monitor nozzles are situated so that they can be used to knock down SO2 vapors if necessary.\n\nRMP elements common to the site:\n\nThe plants are all subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule.\n\nThe site has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM rule.  Some of those polices are listed below:\n1.  Site glass use - Sightglass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn ball valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the traditional HAZOP type of failure analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel (LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with deluge systems, monitor nozzels, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservior.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.  The plant alarm system is tested weekly.\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.",

              "Description": "Sulfur Dioxide Plant - Clariant Operations:\n\nCelanese operates three plants on site that are owned by Clariant Corporation.  Celanese provides operations personnel, management, and safety management for these plants, in accordance with Celanese plant policies.  The plants include:\n\n1.  Sodium Hydrosulfite Plant\n2.  Sulfur Dioxide Plant\n3.  Sodium Bisulfite Plant\n\nEach of these units include a common RMP listed chemical, sulfur dioxide (SO2).  There are three separate storage areas for SO2 on site:\n\n1.  A receiver vessel and a storage tank within the SO2 plant.\n2.  A satellite storage area at the rail loading facility, which includes five storage tanks.  The sodium hydrosulfite and sodium bisulfite plants use SO2 from these storage tanks but most commonly use a single tank designated for plant use.\n3.  The site can also store SO2 in railcars, in the rail yard, while they are awaiting shipment.\n\nRMP specific to SO2:\n\nThe SO2 storage areas are equipped with SO2 gas detectors.  The detectors are arranged around the piping and loading areas.  The gas detectors are tested as part of a maintenance program.  The gas detectors have two levels of operation.  The first level of gas detection senses exposure levels above the 8 hour TWA.  When this occurs an alarm is sounded and operator intervention corrects the leak.  The second level of operation detects a higher concentration which activates an automatic shutoff of loading operations.  Operation personnel then follow appropriate actions to find and correct the leak.\n\nThere is a truck loading area for SO2 in the storage area at the SO2 plant.  There is a railcar and truck loading area in the satellite storage area.  Both of these areas are monitored with video surveillance cameras from the SO2 plant control room.  The operator has the ability to zoom and pan the camera to look at specific pieces of equipment.  This gives the operator an extra set of eyes to spot potential leak problems.\n\nWater is effective in absorbing SO2 gas and is effective in removing SO2 vapors from the air.  Fire water monitor nozzles are situated so that they can be used to knock down SO2 vapors if necessary.\n\nRMP elements common to the site:\n\nThe plants are all subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule.\n\nThe site has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM rule.  Some of those polices are listed below:\n1.  Site glass use - Sightglass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn ball valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the traditional HAZOP type of failure analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel (LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with deluge systems, monitor nozzels, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservior.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.

              "Description": "Amines Plant No. 1 - Celanese Operations:\n\nCelanese owns and operates two multi-purpose amine plants on site.  Celanese performs all activities for the operation of these units.  The plants are called:\n\n1.  Amines Plant No. 1\n2.  Amines Plant No. 2\n\nRMP specific to Cyclohexylamine:\n\nThese units include one common RMP listed chemical above the RMP threshold, cyclohexylamine.  Cyclohexylamine can be produced by both plants, and can be stored in the following locations:\n\n1.  Amines Plant No.1 has daily production storage tanks in the unit.\n2.  Amines Plant No.2 has daily production storage tanks in the unit.\n3.  There are two storage tanks in our tank farm storage facility.  Both plants can use these tanks.\n4.  The site can also store cyclohexylamine in railcars, in the rail yard, while they are awaiting shipment.\n\nOperations of these storage locations and production of cyclohexylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nRMP specific to Amines Plant No. 1:\n\nAmines Plant No. 1 also includes the following RMP listed chemicals above the RMP threshold:\n\n1.  Ammonia\n2.  Isopropylamine\n\nOperations of the storage locations for ammonia and the operations using ammonia fall under the site PSM program.  Ammonia is stored as a liquefied gas.  There are three storage tanks for pure ammonia which do not have storage containment dikes because diking would not contain the ammonia from evaporation.  Storage for ammonia within the process unit does include diking as the ammonia stored in the process is not pure and diking would contain some of the material that would not immediatley evaporate.  \n\nOperations of the storage locations and production of isopropylamine fall under the site PSM program.  The storage locations are covered by automatic and/or manual fire suppression systems.  The storage areas are curbed or diked with hold-up volume adequate to contain all of the tank contents.\n\nRMP elements common to the site:\n\nThe plants are all subject to and operated in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  The site maintains one PSM plan which includes application of the OSHA PSM rule.\n\nThe site has policies that go beyond the OSHA PSM rule.  Some of those polices are listed below:\n1.  Sight glass use: Sight glass use is discouraged in hazardous chemical service.  In cases where sight level indicators are needed, magnetically coupled, metal gauges are used or other provisions are made to protect against releases from breakage.\n2.  Quarter-turn ball valves (1\" size or less) are fitted with oval handles to reduce the risk of releases from bumping a straight handle valve open.\n3.  Qualitative risk assessment is incorporated into our PHA and MOC process in order to provide more consistent evaluation of risk.  This provides better guidance in reducing risk, over the traditional HAZOP type of failure analysis.\n4.  The plant belongs to and participates in a local emergency response group (LEPC) and a local community advisory panel (LCAP).\n5.  All operators are trained and certified in the jobs they perform.\n6.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n7.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical engineering, safety, and regulatory issues.\n8.  All plant operators are trained in emergency response.\n9.  The plant has an extensive fire fighting system with deluge systems, monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability and water reservoir.\n10.  The plant has a portable emergency command vehicle complete with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, emergency response and decontamination materials.\n11.  The plant alarm system is tested weekly.\n12.  Emergency response personnel are trained in first aid and CPR.",

      "SummaryText": "At Celanese, we are dedicated to being an industry leader in protecting the environment, the health, and safety of both our employees and the communities in which we operate.  Like our community neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks site want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why Celanese has a \"zero incident\" goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental and process incidents.\n\nThe Celanese Bucks site began operations in 1970.  We have 100 employees, plus an average of 50 resident contractors.  We manufacture four amine products for Celanese.  We operate production facilities owned by Clariant, a Swiss based specialty chemical company, and we provide manufacturing services for IB Nitrogen, a subsidiary of a Canadian fertilizer company.\n\nThe Celanese amine products are:\n     Isopropylamine\n     Dipropylamine\n     Cyclohexylamine\n     Diamylamine\nThese products are used by other chemical companies to make herbicides, insecticides, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Clariant products are:\n     Sodium hydrosulfite\n     Sodium bisulfite\n     Sulfur dioxide\nThese products are used in the textile, pulp and paper, food, and wine industries.\n\nThe IB Nitrogen product is:\n     Isobutylidene diurea\nThis product is a slow-release specialty fertilizer used on golf courses and turf farms.  It is also used in plant nurseries for growing ornamentals such as azaleas and poinsettias.\n\nThe EPA's Risk Management Plan provides an excellent vehicle for continued dialogue with the people that live and work around the Celanese Bucks site.  The Celanese Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The LeMoyne Community Advisory Panel and the LeMoyne Industrial Park companies are recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding coop"

This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\nPlant Organization:\n\nThe plant has a site director (plant manager) who oversees all plant activities.  The site director oversees the plant management council.  The plant management council members include four hourly plant operations personnel, one from each of the main operating areas.  The other members of the plant management council include the members of plant management staff.  The staff includes an occupational safety manager, process safety manager, environmental manager, industrial hygienist, production manager for Celanese operations, production manager for Clariant operations, production manager for IB Nitrogen operations, financial controller, and maintenance/project engineers.\n\nProduction units are organized in teams.  All plant employees must attend at least one safety meeting per month.  All plant operators are included in a rotation to conduct a safety meetings.  Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.\n\nPlant operators are trained as part of the BEST team (the Bucks Emergency Response Team).  They learn the specifics of emergency response command, emergency response techniques, and conduct drills.\n\nWhat is RMP?\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established regulations that require Celanese and many other companies to file a Risk Management Plan (RMP) by June 21, 1999.  The Celanese Bucks Plant has 5 chemicals on a list of 140 chemicals developed by the EPA.  All companies that use, make or store a minimum quantity of these chemicals must meet these regulations.\n\nCelanese was already complying with most of the EPA's requirements for RMP through our Process Safety Management Program and to comply with the OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation).

Additionally, RMP requires each site to determine a more likely scenario that could potentially impact the public.  These are called the Alternate Release Scenarios.\n\nListed chemical       Maximum distance\nSulfur Dioxide          1.4 miles\nAmmonia                  0.6 miles\nPropionitrile              1.2 miles\nCyclohexylamine      0.2 miles\nIsopropylamine         0.5 miles\n\nPlant 5 Year Accident History: \nRMP requires us to tell the public about accidents involving the listed chemicals that resulted in injuries or serious on-site or off-site impact.

There was a rail car fire in 1996 which was a significant incident but it did not involve an RMP chemical. There has never been a Worst Case Scenario type event in our 29 year history at Bucks.\n\n\nHow We Keep Our Plant Safe:\n\nPeople: Our Most Valuable Safety Resource\n\n1.  All plant operators are trained and certified in the jobs they do.\n2.  All employees have the authority to shut down any process or stop any job, in order to maintain safe operation.\n3.  A self-paced training program covers job specific tasks, principles of chemical processing, safety, and regulatory issues.\n \nEquipment: Maintained in Safe Condition\n\n1.  All plant process equipment is subjected to mechanical integrity inspections to look for corrosion or wear.\n2.  Safety devices such as pressure relief valves and shutdown systems are inspected and tested on a regular basis.\n3.  A thermographic camera allows us to check for temperature deviations in equipment, check for electrical faults, and verify levels.\n4.  Glass level gauges have been replaced with metal, magnetically-coupled gauges.\n\nSafety Systems: Protective Safety Net\n\n1.  All storage tanks and process vessels are protected against over-pressure by safety relief valves, much like the safety relief valve on your home water heater.\n2.  Process safety systems are programmed in our process control computers.  If a designated level, pressure, temperature, or other parameter goes out of range, the process will shut down automatically.\n3.  Video surveillance cameras are installed to help operators monitor the processes.\n4.  Gas detectors are installed to warn of leaks.  Our SO2 gas detection system will automatically stop loading operations.\n5.  Oxygen detectors protect the integrity of key equipment including va"
