This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site primary activity is chemical manufacturing, including specialty products and chemicals, adhesives and plastics.  There are three (3) covered processes, five (5) programs and ten (10) regulated substances present at DuPont Michigan Operations Site stationary source.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances are listed below.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nBromine\n\nChloromethyl methyl ether\n\nDimethylamine\n\nEthyl chloride\n\nEthyl Ether (di ethyl ether)\n\nMethyl chloride\n\nMethyl Ether\n\nOleum (Fuming Sulfuric Acid)\n\nPropylene oxide\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\n\n\n\nThere is one (1) toxic worst case and one (1) flammable worst case reported.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable company and governing agency requirements at the time of construction.  Modifications to existing structures are also done in compliance with applicable company standards and governing agency requirements.  Several processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 19 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Michigan Operations Site.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation, calculations of The Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion and Chemical Exposure Indices are performed, and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis is conducted.

A team of qualified personnel performs the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, DuPont Michigan Operations Site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel receive specialized training as needed.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The facility has a strict program for informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes, as well as the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform the facility of any hazards they may introduce or encounter while at the site.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Michigan Operations Site had a small Oleum release (prior to commencing ownership) in 2016 that was contained on-site but had several workers nearby.  For precautionary reasons only, several personnel were sent to the Dow Medical Center for evaluation.  One individual experienced eye irritation requiring a prescription medicine resulting in a recordable injury and accident reporting.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.
