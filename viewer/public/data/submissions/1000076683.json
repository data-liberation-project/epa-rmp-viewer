The facility has a strict program for informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes, as well as the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform the facility of any hazards they may introduce or encounter while at the site.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe DuPont Michigan Operations Site had a small Oleum release (prior to commencing ownership) in 2016 that was contained on-site but had several workers nearby.  For precautionary reasons only, several personnel were sent to the Dow Medical Center for evaluation.  One individual experienced eye irritation requiring a prescription medicine resulting in a recordable injury and accident reporting.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan documents all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes within the processes at the facility that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the facility emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\nEmergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced in order to ensure that it is functioning properly at all times.  \r\n\r\nPlan"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable company and governing agency requirements at the time of construction.  Modifications to existing structures are also done in compliance with applicable company standards and governing agency requirements.  Several processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 19 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Michigan Operations Site.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nDuPont Michigan Operations Site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
