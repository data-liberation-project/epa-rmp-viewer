In addition, Texas Eastman has six toxic substances listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 in quantities above the threshold limit.  These are anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, ethylene oxide, formaldehyde solution, isobutyronitrile and titanium tetrachloride\n\nFlammable Gases and Liquids\n\nBasic Information:\nTexas Eastman Division uses flammable gases and liquids in many of its operations.  Three examples of flammables used include acetaldehyde, natural gasoline and ethylene. Acetaldehyde is a colorless gas with a pungent choking odor.  Natural gasoline is a colorless volatile liquid with a petroleum-like odor.  Ethylene is a colorless gas with a sweet odor. All three of these materials are extremely flammable.  Leaks of these materials can ignite and create a flash fire or a vapor cloud explosion. \n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division produces acetaldehyde for sale to outside customers who convert it into other chemicals found in common household items such as aspirin, mustard, ketchup, dill pickles and Vitamin B-12. Natural gasoline is used as one of the basic feedstocks for the Texas Eastman plant site.  Ethylene is produced by Texas Eastman and is used as one of the basic building blocks for most of the other chemicals produced at Texas Eastman Division\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nBasic Information:\nAnhydrous ammonia is a clear, colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor.  The vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  Long-term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health affects from inhalation.  It is soluble in water, forming a corrosive liquid.  Gaseous ammonia is lighter than air, but vapors from a leak may initially hug the ground.  Ammonia gas is normally not considered a serious fire hazard, but at high enough concentration and under the right conditions, it can "

At low concentrations chlorine becomes colorless but it retains its characteristic odor.  It is commonly used to purify water, and to make other chemicals.  Long term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects from inhalation.   In high enough concentrations, chlorine will cause severe irritation to the eyes, coughing, and breathing difficulty.  Chlorine does not burn but will support combustion (lets other articles burn). The vapors are much heavier than air and tend to settle in low areas.\n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division uses chlorine primarily for water treatment.  A small amount is utilized to produce chemicals used by others in the manufacture of photographic film, fingernail polish remover, inks, pharmaceuticals, and coatings.\n\nEthylene Oxide\n\nBasic Information:\nEthylene oxide is a clear, colorless, volatile liquid with an ether-like odor.  It is commonly used by the chemical industry to make other chemicals and by hospitals to sterilize equipment.  The vapors are irritating to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system.  Prolonged contact with the skin may result in a chemical burn.  Ethylene oxide is soluble in water and extremely flammable.  The vapors are much heavier than air and tend to settle in low areas.\n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division produces ethylene oxide as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals including ethylene glycol.  Ethylene glycol is used as antifreeze and in the manufacture of PET plastic used in the manufacture of soft drink bottles and other food packaging.

Long-term exposure to low concentrations of hydrochloric acid or short-term exposure to high concentrations of hydrochloric acid may result in adverse health effects from inhalation.   In high enough concentrations, the hydrochloric acid may cause severe irritation to the eyes, coughing, and breathing difficulty. \n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman Division receives titanium tetrachloride in 250-gallon cylinders.  It is used in the manufacture of polyethylene plastic. Polyethylene is used in many common items including toys, food containers, automobiles, and garbage bags.  \n\nIII. Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nToxic Substance Worst Case Scenario\n\nEthylene oxide constitutes the Longview plant site's toxic worst case scenario.  In this scenario, the largest vessel containing ethylene oxide was assumed to catastrophically rupture.  It was assumed that the entire tank contents evaporated into the atmosphere over a ten-minute period.  It was further assumed that all of the active safety systems in place to mitigate and reduce the amount of vapors in the atmosphere also failed.  Under worst case weather conditions this scenario shows potential off-site consequences.  \n\nFlammable Substance Worst Case Scenarios\n\nNatural gasoline constitutes one of the Longview plant site's flammable worst case scenario for the north end of the plant site.  In this scenario, the largest vessel containing natural gasoline was assumed to  catastrophically rupture and the entire contents immediately vaporized.  It was also assumed that all of the safety systems in place to mitigate and reduce the amount of vapor in the atmosphere and prevent ignition also failed. It was assumed that the vapor cloud ignited and exploded.  This scenario shows potential off-site consequences.\n\nAcetaldehyde constitutes the worst case scenario for the south end of the "

None is shipped outside the plant.\n\nFormaldehyde Solution\n\nBasic Information:\nFormaldehyde solution is a colorless solution of formaldehyde gas in water. It is totally soluble in water.  Its vapors are heavier than air.  Formaldehyde is a lacrymator causing eye irritation and tearing of the eyes.  Vapors can only be withstood for a few minutes.  Long-term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations can result in adverse health effects from inhalation.  Breathing is difficult in low concentrations, accompanied by cough and severe burning to the nose and throat.\n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman receives formaldehyde as a 50% solution in water in tank trucks and railcars.  It is used as a feedstock to manufacture a product that is used in many consumer items.  These include fiberglass shower stalls and boat hulls, imitation marble counter tops and environmentally friendly paints and coatings.     \n\nIsobutyronitrile\n\nBasic Information:\nIsobutyronitrile is a clear, colorless liquid with a distinct bitter odor resembling almonds.  Its rate of evaporation into the atmosphere is about like water.   Isobutyronitrile can enter the body by skin contact with the liquid or by inhalation of the vapors.  Exposure to liquid or vapor may produce symptoms similar to that of carbon monoxide.  This includes dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and general weakness.  Prolonged or high exposure may cause tightness in the chest and breathing difficulty.  These effects may be delayed by 30 minutes to one hour after exposure.\n\nUses:\nTexas Eastman manufactures isobutyronitrile for sale to outside customers.  It is used primarily in the manufacture of lawn pesticides.\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride\n\nBasic Information:\nTitanium Tetrachloride is a heavy liquid with a yellowish color and a sharp, pungent odor.

It was assumed that the vapor cloud ignited and exploded.  This scenario shows potential off-site consequences.\n\n\nToxic Substance Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nFor each of the six toxic substances at the Longview site, an alternate release or emergency planning scenario was estimated.  Of the six, only four showed the potential for off-site consequences that could possibly affect people or a designated receptor.  The assumed alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia was a hypothetical rupture of the 1 1/2 inch liquid transfer hose.  The assumed alternate release scenario for chlorine was the hypothetical failure of the 1/2 inch vapor valve on a one-ton chlorine cylinder.  The assumed alternate case scenario for all other toxic substances was assume to be the rupture of a 2 inch connection to the largest vessel containing the substance in question.\n\nFlammable Substance Alternate Release Scenario\n\nFor flammable substances at the Longview site, an alternate release or emergency planning scenario was estimated.  The assumed alternate release scenario was the rupture of a 2-inch pipe in the high pressure Polyethylene Unit.  It was assumed that all of the ethylene between the two emergency shutoff valves leaked to the atmosphere, ignited and exploded.  This scenario shows potential off-site consequences.  \n\nIV.
