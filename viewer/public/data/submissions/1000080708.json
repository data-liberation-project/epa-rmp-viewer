The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions potentially taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Any incident investigation reports will be retained for five years and will be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Site conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

The program consists of procedures for contacting responders for mitigation of a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response by outside experts, and include proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and any decontamination requirements. Employees receive appropriate training in procedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Site processes or other facilities within the Site.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nEmployees receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits, such as adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs by the supplier. The supplier is responsible for ensuring that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Site has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and Site changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. The Site's operational status is inspected during the operator's normal hours. Identified issues are reported to Kinder Morgan, who is responsible for the maintenance of equipment at the Site. \r\nOperations at the Site have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation.

      "SummaryText": "The following Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been produced as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nXTO Energy, Inc. (XTO) has a strong commitment to the protection of workers and the environment.  The North Lansing Site (the Site) has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of all operating units and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the Site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Site is located near the southwestern corner of the intersection of Farm-to-Market (FM) 449 and FM 2208 approximately 7 miles southeast of Harleton, Texas in Harrison County. The Site neither uses nor stores any regulated toxic substance above RMP threshold quantities (40 CFR \u00a7 68.130). Inherent with the operation of a gas refrigeration site, the Site processes and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable substances are addressed throughout the RMP, and may include pentane, ethane, propane, and butane, which are all components of the Natural Gas Liquids Product (NGLP). \r\n\r\nG"
