If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons and the environment.\n2.Facility Information.\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 530,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon and two 18,000 gallon storage tanks and 60-1000 gallon nurse tanks. \n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\na. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximim quantity released would be 132,600 pounds,  which represent the volume of the sorage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the enpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 4.4 miles.\nb. The alternative release scenario based on five-year accident history (or the most likely potntial incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 pp ) is .30 miles.\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, Hazard Communication.\n5.Five-year Accident Histiory.\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n6.Emergency Response Program. The \"Emergency Action Plan\" of Trotter Fertilizer describes procedures to minimize haxards to human health and to the environment from sudden releases and non-sudden releases of chemicals. Copies of the well organized easy to use color codes \"plan\" have been distributed to the Local E"
