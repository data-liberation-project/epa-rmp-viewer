In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\n\n\nCone Ag-Service, Inc. Mission states \"To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the \n\ngeneral public\".  In order to fulfill this mission, Cone Ag-Service, Inc. provides a EHS group to maintain and \n\nadminister comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services\n\nsupervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tanks [1@ 18,000 gallon; 1 @ 12,000 gallon] on site.\n\n154,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage "

Therefore, the total \n\nfacility is 620,000 pounds.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 160,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\n\nOur worst scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 80 ton rail car, when filled to the greatest amount\n\nallowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum\n\nquantity released would be 160,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to \n\npoint of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted that Cone Ag-Service, Inc. \n\nhas never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off site.\n\nThe alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a \n\nstationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total\n\namount of anhydrous ammonia released in the scenario would be 27,000 pounds.  This release scenario\n\n(distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted Cone Ag-\n\nService has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the\n\nASME codes.  This facility complies with the ASNI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111),\n\nEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and \n\nregulations.\n\n\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, \n\nrelief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.
