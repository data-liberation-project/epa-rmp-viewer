      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nUSEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under Section 68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe Cincinnati Water Works, Richard Miller Water Treatment Plant (WTP) utilizes more than a threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to resubmit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in Section 68.150 by June 21, 2004 (five years the initial June, 1999 submission).  Public employees are covered under the State of Ohio's Public Employee Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), which has adopted by reference the requirements of OSHA's (PSM) Standard.  Based on the March 1999 revised USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) (EPA 550-B-98-010), the Richard Miller WTP is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements of the RMP Regulation.  \n\nUSEPA's RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary.  The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40"

      "SummaryText": " CFR 68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n\nSection 68.155(a): Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe Richard Miller WTP has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facility's Emergency Action Plan.  This plan has been endorsed by the Cincinnati Water Works staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Richard Miller WTP.  The Richard Miller WTP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak.  All personnel involved in handling chlorine are trained with regard to chlorine safety and accident prevention.\n\n\nSection 68.155(b): Stationary Source and Substance Handled.\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Richard Miller WTP Post-Chlorination Facility.  The Richard Miller WTP has a capacity of 220 million gallons of water per day (MGD) and treats surface water to drinking water standards.  The Richard Miller WTP Post-Chlorination Facility is divided into several individual rooms dedicated to specific tasks: the Storage/Unloading Room, Chlorinator Room, Scrubber Room, Electrical Room, Transformer Room, and Breathing Air Room.  \n\nThe storage room houses five banks capable of holding 12 one-ton containers that store chlorine as a pressurized liquid.  One bank is solely for storage of empty chlorine cylinders. Each of the four remaining twelve-cylinder banks is divided into two six-cylinder groups that are scaled and manifolded together. Two six-cylinder scales are kept empty at any given point in time to expedite the loading/unloading process.  While all 36 remaining cylinders are connected to the process, two six-cylinder groups are in the \"off\" position, two six-cylinder groups are in the \"on\" position and are feeding the process, and two six-cylinder groups are in the \"on\" position in a stand-by capacity for automatic switchover when the contents of the on-line, feeding containers, are exhausted.

      "SummaryText": "hlorine gas is fed from the containers through the automatic switchover system.  Vacuum chlorinators and associated chlorine injectors are provided for solution chlorine feed at various process locations.  Vacuum chlorine feed reduces the likelihood of a release into the environment.\n\nThe Post-Chlorination Facility is equipped with many safety features to prevent any public exposure in the event of a chlorine leak.  Several chlorine leak detectors are located throughout the Storage Room and one in the Chlorinator Room.  To allow safety personnel time to respond to emergencies, audible alarms automatically sound inside and outside of the building when chlorine levels reach 0.5 ppm.  At 3 ppm the building ventilation system automatically shuts down to contain the chlorine inside the building at which time the scrubber system may be manually activated to remove the chlorine from the  facility air. In addition, the chlorine header was placed below grade to minimize the likelihood of the header being ruptured by a ton container falling on it during placement.\n\n \nSection 68.165: Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\nAs a Program 3 Process with one toxic gas, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario were assessed for the Post-Chlorination Facility.  The Richard Miller WTP has chosen to use the US EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68), US EPA 550-B-98-010, October 1998, (WWTP Guidance), as a guide to determine off-site consequences.  This guidance specifically addresses the chemicals commonly found at WWTPs.  The chlorination process for WTPs is similar to the chlorination process at WWTPs.  Therefore, this guidance document is applicable to the Richard Miller WTP's chlorination process.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).  For the Richard Miller WTP Post-Chlorination Facility the worst-case scenario is a total "

      "SummaryText": "release from one of the one-ton containers of chlorine (greatest amount held in a single vessel).  It is assumed that the container ruptures and its entire contents escape from the building in 10 minutes.  The passive mitigation of the building is not considered.  Additionally, the worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.   The rate of chlorine released to the outdoor air for the worst case scenario is 200 pounds per minute.  Using the reference tables in the USEPA RMP Guidance for WWTPs, a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles was determined for the worst case scenario.  The residential population within a 0.9 mile radius of influence for Richard Miller WTP plant was determined to be approximately 570 people. The radius of influence includes residences and parks, but does not encompass any schools, hospitals, or prisons.\n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alternative release scenario selected was that of a 3/16 inch diameter opening in a valve, gasket, flexible tubing, or piping occurring inside the enclosed Storage Room or Chlorination Room.  Using the guidance for alternative release scenarios of chlorine vapor in the USEPA RMP Guidance for WWTPs and without taking passive mitigation of the building into consideration, this chlorine gas release would result in a release rate of 3.0 pounds of chlorine per minute for a period of 30 minutes, resulting in a 90 pound gas release from the building. The reference tables in USEPA RMP Guidance for WWTPs give a distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario.  The residential population within a 0.1 mile radius of influence of the Richard Miller WTP Post Chlorination Facility was determined to be approximately zero people.  The radius of influence does not include residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas"

These prevention measures include elements such as employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.  \n\nRichard Miller WTP is equipped with many safety features to prevent any public exposure in the unlikely event of a chlorine leak.  Several chlorine leak detectors are located throughout the Storage Room and one in the Chlorinator Room.  To allow safety personnel time to respond to emergencies, audible alarms automatically sound inside and outside of the building when chlorine levels reach 0.5 ppm.  At 3 ppm the building ventilation system automatically shuts down to contain the chlorine inside the building at which time the scrubber system may be manually activated to remove the chlorine from the  facility air.  In addition, the chlorine header was placed below grade to minimize the likelihood of the header being ruptured by a ton container falling on it during placement.  Richard Miller WTP employees who are involved in chlorine operations are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of chlorine at the facility.\n\n\nSection 68.155(d): Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThe Post-Chlorination facility was completed in 1997.  One accident, as described under 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), has occurred at this facility since it began operation.  On September 24, 2002, the Richard Miller WTP took delivery from a vendor of a chlorine ton cylinder with a leaking valve.  In compliance with the Emergency Action Plan, emergency responders were called to the site.  Approximately five pounds of chlorine gas was relea"

The chlorine scrubber system successfully neutralized the chlorine in the facility air.  Three minor employee injuries were sustained in the incident.  There were no offsite consequences, and no building or equipment damage.\n\n\nSection 68.155(e): Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe Richard Miller WTP has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety as allowed by 40 CFR 68.90(b).  The Richard WTP facility Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency and has coordinated this plan with the City of Cincinnati Hazardous Materials Response Unit, Rescue 52.  Rescue 52 personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a non incidental chlorine emergency.  Richard Miller WTP employees are not designated first responders to a serious or unplanned chlorine release.  As specified in 40 CFR 68.90(b), Richard Miller WTP's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed, and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.\n\n\nSection 68.155(f): Safety Improvements:\n \nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) on May 24, 2004.  Recommended improvements were identified in three main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Maintenance, and Training.  According to the PSM, any safety improvements will be investigated concerning their impacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  Additional recommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the PHA is updated every five years."
