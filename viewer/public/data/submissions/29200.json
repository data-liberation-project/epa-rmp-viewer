More important, it is an integral part of a greater \rcommitment by MIS owners, Casco Bay Energy Company and Duke Energy North \rAmerica, to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, and the \rcommunities they serve.\r\r2.\tBackground Scope Purpose\r\rMIS is a single unit, 520 MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant, located in \rVeazie, Maine.  MIS is a new plant that began operating in the spring of 2000.  As part \rof its air pollution control technology, MIS uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR).\r\rThe SCR process removes nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases produced during \rcombustion of fossil fuels in the gas turbines when generating electricity.  The SCR \rprocess introduces aqueous ammonia into the exhaust gas stream and then passes the \rmixture through a catalyst bed.  The resultant chemical reaction generates nitrogen gas \rand water as the reduced end products, which in turn are released to the atmosphere \rvia the plant\u00bfs exhaust stack.\r\rMIS stores the aqueous ammonia on site as a 29.5 percent solution in a 21,282-gallon \rtank.  The quantity of aqueous ammonia stored exceeds the EPA regulated threshold \rquantity for accidental release prevention.  Therefore, MIS is subject to EPA\u00bfs Risk \rManagement Program (RMP).\r\rThe goal of the RMP is:  1) to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause \rserious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures; and 2) to \rmitigate the severity of releases that may occur.\r\rCovered facilities, such as MIS, must develop and implement a RMP.  The RMP must \rinclude an analysis of potential off-site consequences of a regulated substance \raccidental release, a release prevention program, and an emergency r"

Covered facilities also must submit to the EPA a summary of their risk \rmanagement program, which also will be made available to other federal, state, and \rgovernment agencies as well as the public.\r\r3.\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\rAs required, MIS performed an off-site consequence analysis that included a worst-case \rand alternative accident scenario of its regulated substance, aqueous ammonia.  The \rworst-case scenario is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance \r(regardless of its likelihood) that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The \rendpoint is a numerical concentration chosen by EPA beyond which it is believed that \rnearly all individuals could be exposed without any serious health effects.  The \ralternative scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and \rthat reaches off site.\r\rMIS performed a number of different accident analyses to determine which ones \rpresent the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is the radius \rof a circular area that might be affected in the event of an accidental chemical release.  \rThe accident analyses followed the steps detailed in the EPA guidance document \u00bfRisk \rManagement Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis,\u00bf April 1999.  The \rendpoint distances were calculated using EPA\u00bfs software utility program RMP*Comp.\r\rMIS determined the worst-case scenario to be when there is a failure of the transfer \rhose or coupling connecting a delivery truck unloading aqueous ammonia to the storage \rtank.  This accident scenario would result in the largest quantity of aqueous ammonia \rbeing released directly to the environment.  The estimated endpoint distance is 0.7 \rmiles.\r\rMIS determined the more likely alternate scenario to occur is the failure of a valve or \rpipe at the base of the ammonia storage tank.  This accident scenario would cause \raqueous ammonia to be released into a diked area with potential effects occur"

The provisions of the plan include \rprocedures for internal and external notifications, preliminary emergency assessment, \rmitigating actions, and mobilization of resources.
