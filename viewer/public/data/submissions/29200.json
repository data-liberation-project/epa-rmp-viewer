Purpose\n\nThis executive summary is part of the information Maine Independence Station (MIS) is \nrequired to submit to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relating to \naccidental release prevention.  More important, it is an integral part of a greater \ncommitment by MIS owners, Casco Bay Energy Company and Duke Energy North \nAmerica, to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, and the \ncommunities they serve.\n\n2.    Background Scope Purpose\n\nMIS is a single unit, 520 MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant, located in \nVeazie, Maine.  MIS is a new plant that began operating in the spring of 2000.  As part \nof its air pollution control technology, MIS uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR).\n\nThe SCR process removes nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases produced during \ncombustion of fossil fuels in the gas turbines when generating electricity.  The SCR \nprocess introduces aqueous ammonia into the exhaust gas stream and then passes the \nmixture through a catalyst bed.  The resultant chemical reaction generates nitrogen gas \nand water as the reduced end products, which in turn are released to the atmosphere \nvia the plant?s exhaust stack.\n\nMIS stores the aqueous ammonia on site as a 29.5 percent solution in a 21,282-gallon \ntank.  The quantity of aqueous ammonia stored exceeds the EPA regulated threshold \nquantity for accidental release prevention.  Therefore, MIS is subject to EPA?s Risk \nManagement Program (RMP).\n\nThe goal of the RMP is:  1) to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause \nserious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures; and 2) to \nmitigate the severity of releases that may occur.\n\nCovered facilities, such as MIS, must develop and implement a RMP.  The RMP must \ninclude an analysis of potential off-site consequences of a regulated substance \naccidental release, a release prevention program, and an emergency r"

      "SummaryText": "esponse \nprogram.  Covered facilities also must submit to the EPA a summary of their risk \nmanagement program, which also will be made available to other federal, state, and \ngovernment agencies as well as the public.\n\n3.    Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required, MIS performed an off-site consequence analysis that included a worst-case \nand alternative accident scenario of its regulated substance, aqueous ammonia.  The \nworst-case scenario is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance \n(regardless of its likelihood) that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The \nendpoint is a numerical concentration chosen by EPA beyond which it is believed that \nnearly all individuals could be exposed without any serious health effects.  The \nalternative scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and \nthat reaches off site.\n\nMIS performed a number of different accident analyses to determine which ones \npresent the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is the radius \nof a circular area that might be affected in the event of an accidental chemical release.  \nThe accident analyses followed the steps detailed in the EPA guidance document ?Risk \nManagement Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis,? April 1999.  The \nendpoint distances were calculated using EPA?s software utility program RMP*Comp.\n\nMIS determined the worst-case scenario to be when there is a failure of the transfer \nhose or coupling connecting a delivery truck unloading aqueous ammonia to the storage \ntank.  This accident scenario would result in the largest quantity of aqueous ammonia \nbeing released directly to the environment.  The estimated endpoint distance is 0.7 \nmiles.\n\nMIS determined the more likely alternate scenario to occur is the failure of a valve or \npipe at the base of the ammonia storage tank.  This accident scenario would cause \naqueous ammonia to be released into a diked area with potential effects occur"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo ensure a hazardous chemical release does not occur, MIS has implemented a multi-\nelement prevention program.  The program elements are designed to meet EPA?s Risk \nManagement Program requirements and include the use of:\n\n?    Operator attendance at truck loading and unloading operations;\n?    Secondary containment around tanks;\n?    Process safety information to document the safe process design;\n?    Process hazard reviews to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n?    Operating procedures to ensure that the systems are operated safely;\n?    Maintenance to ensure that the systems meet applicable standards and \nmanufacturer?s recommendations;\n?    Training to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the \nprocesses are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know \nthe actions to be taken in an emergency;\n?    Incident investigation procedures to examine each incident and ?near misses? to \ndetermine the root cause and make needed safety improvements; and\n?    Periodic compliance audits.\n\nMIS believes that these elements provide a well-established, integrated approach to \nensure that the storage of aqueous ammonia will have a substantial margin of safety to \nprotect both the public and the environment.\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the MIS has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan \n(ICP).  The ICP is designed to minimize the hazards to the public or the environment \nfrom fires, explosions, natural disasters, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden \nrelease of chemicals to air, soil, or surface water.  The provisions of the plan include \nprocedures for internal and external notifications, preliminary emergency assessment, \nmitigating actions, and mobilization of resources.  Additionally, the ICP describes \npersonnel training, conduct, and frequency of drills or exercises, and coordination with \nlocal responder"
