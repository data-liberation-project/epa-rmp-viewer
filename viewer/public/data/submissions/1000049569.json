Toxic Worst Case Scenario: Failure of 2 cylinders of 375 lbs each of propylene oxide (total: 750 lbs) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 10.8 minute period. The 750 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.4 miles.\r\nb. Toxic Alternative Scenario: Failure of transfer hose/line or cylinder releasing 375 lbs (one cylinder) of propylene oxide inside a diked area with sumps and deluge water available and resulting in the complete release of contents over a 10 minute period. The 375 pounds would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.1 miles.\r\n4.
