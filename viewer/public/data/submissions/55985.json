The Water Division is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees.  Water Supervisor is tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the Valley Pumping Plant.  In addition, the Division has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities.  This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions.  Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothesize potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe City of Burbank Valley Pumping Plant is located at 2030 North Hollywood Way in Burbank, California 91505.  The ammonia system and the chlorine system were constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is surrounded by chain link fence with access through several gates.  Visitors are permitted to enter the facility by checking in with the operations personnel.  A maximum five one-ton containers and three 150-pound cylinders (10,450 pounds) of chlorine is maintained on site.  A maximum of 4,480 pounds of ammonia is maintained on site within two tanks.\n\nThe City of Burbank Valley Pumping Plant disinfection process consists of treating up to 9,000 gallons per minute of pre-treated groundwater from the San Fernando Valley groundwater basin at the North Hollywood Area Superfund site.  The process consists of injecting chlorine and ammonia into the pre-treated groundwater supply.  \n\nChlorine System:\n\nThe chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  Gaseou"

The resulting chlorine solution is added to the influent groundwater in a diffuser vault prior to the five million gallon reservoir (forebay) for primary disinfection.  The forebay is used to provide the required chlorine contact time for primary disinfection by free chlorination.\n\nIn the chlorine storage room at the Valley Pumping Plant, two one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.  An automatic switchover valve allows only one of the containers; it opens supply chlorine from the other container.  All empty tanks connected to the manifold are replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by City of Burbank operators using a monorail hoist.\n\nWhile connected to the system, two one-ton containers are placed on a scale to allow City of Burbank operators to plan the change out procedure.  Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The vacuum regulator/heater assembly is placed on the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas is pulled from the container.  The vacuum created at the injector(s) produces the necessary vacuum to operate the vacuum regulators in the chlorine distribution system.  The heater is used to ensure that gaseous chlorine does not condense.\n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one-ton container to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with rotameters to control the flow of the chlorine gas.  After the chlorinator, the chlorine is injected (by the injector) into the water line to create a chlorine solution.\n\nDetectors in the storage and feed rooms indicate chlorine gas leaks.  The disinfection building is also equipped with an automatic emergency chlorine scrubber system that is capable of neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine v"

The ammonia reacts with chlorine almost instantaneously to form the monochloramines required to meet the water distribution system residuals.  A potable water softening system is located in the water softener room north of the ammonia feed room.\n\nThe ammonia system is vacuum operated.  The vacuum created at the injector(s) produces the necessary vacuum to operate the vacuum regulators on the ammonia distribution system.  Detectors in each of the storage and feed rooms indicate possible ammonia gas leaks.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Burbank ammonia system and chlorine system have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the City of Burbank facility operates in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThe pumping plant operating schedule is 9 hours per day, 7 days per week, with at least two (2) employees assigned to each shift.  The disinfection operation at the facility operates 24 hours a day, seven days per week.

The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm are located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine scrubber system is activated which neutralizes gaseous chlorine in the room resulting in a lower chlorine concentration, and an off-site alarm company will alert the local fire department via telephone.\n\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber is located outside and east of the chlorine storage room.  The system is designed to achieve a flow rate of 3,000 cubic feet per minute and is capable of completely neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor on a once-through basis (equivalent to a complete ton container failure with an average 20% flash off rate).  The scrubber design requirements are based on the Uniform Fire Code (UFC), which allows for a maximum concentration of chlorine in the scrubber exhaust for 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nFuse plugs serve as safety relief for one-ton containers.  There are three fuse plugs on each end of the one-ton containers for a total of six.  They are designed to melt, relieving pressure, in the event that the temperature reaches 156-164oF.\n\nAmmonia System:\n\nThe Valley Pumping Plant is designed to safely and efficiently treat groundwater.   The ammonia system process takes place in several rooms.  The ammonia storage room safety device consists of a leak detector on the interior wall, a panic button on the interior wall at each exit, and an alarm panel.

Some status indicators send an alarm to the control panel, others trigger another device to start up or shut off, and some are remote indicators that are monitored on a routine basis during operations.\n\nThree (3) ammonia leak detectors are operated on 120-volt AC, 60 Hz, 5A power supply.  The detectors are located on the west wall of the ammonia storage room and on the south wall of the ammonia feed room.  Both ammonia leak detectors are electrochemical to detect and provide warning of the presence of ammonia gas in the air.  The detectors are sensitive to ammonia gas at concentrations of 20 ppm by volume, and have double pole, double throw (DPDT) alarm contacts.  During an alarm condition in the ammonia feed room or the ammonia storage room, the leak detectors initiate the following actions: 1) a red alarm light within the detector, 2) activate the alarm system.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAt the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation conducted on September 30, 2009, it was verified that there have been no significant release of chlorine or ammonia that exceeded the applicable Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds and 100 pounds, respectively, at the Valley Pumping Plant, Reservoir #5, the GAC Unit, and the Palm Avenue Pumping Station over the past five years (September 2004 to September 2009) or the California threshold of ?any significant? release.
