The primary function of this plant is to treat water. In the process of water treatment the District utilizes the use of two regulated toxic substances, chlorine and an ammonia concentration.\n  Chlorine, in the form of a gas and liquid, is received from the manufacture in standard one ton containers. The maximum amount that we will have on site is 48,000 pounds. A 30% ammonia solution is received from the manufacture, in the form of a liquid, and pumped into one of two 6,000 gallon bulk storage tanks. The maximum amount of ammonia that the District will have on site will be 97,000 pounds (ammonia and water solution). \n  The District is a safety minded organization, having regular safety meetings, with management reviewing and implementing new safety guidelines as needed.\n  The District used the EPAs RMP*Comp to analyze the regulated toxic substances worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n  Worst case release scenario for chlorine:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine, the release was in an enclosed space within direct contact with outside air. The release was in rural surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 3.0 miles. There would be an off site impact with this release due to a residential population estimated at 2,000 persons and several recreation parks located at the Lake.\n  Alternative release scenario for chlorine:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 1,000 pounds of chlorine, the release was in an enclosed space within direct contact with outside air. The release was in rural surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 0.4 miles. There would be an off site impact with this release due to a residential population estimated at 150 persons and several recreation parks located at the La"

None of the chemical was assumed to be released from the enclosure, and it was assumed there would be a release of ammonia vapors. The release was in rural surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 0.2 miles. There would be an off site impact, due to ammonia vapors, with this release due to a residential population estimated at 120 persons.\n  Alternative release scenario for 30% solution of ammonia:\nIn this scenario the District assumed a release of 2,000 pounds of ammonia solution, the release was in a enclosure designed to contain the entire contents of the bulk storage tank. None of the chemical was assumed to be released from the enclosure, and it was assumed there would be a release of ammonia vapors. The release was in rural surroundings with the estimated distance affected by this release to be at 0.1 miles. There would be an off site impact, due to ammonia vapors, with this release due to a residential population estimated at 10 persons.\n  In the past five years the District has had no accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia solution. We believe this is due to our safety program and having experienced and trained personnel. In the event that we would have a accident, we have on site self contained breathing apparatus and drum repair kits to assist us in the repair of chlorine drums and our bulk storage tanks.\n  If an accidental release should occur, the District has coordinated the emergency response with the Bell County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) and the Belton Fire Department. The District provides training to its personnel through in house training, vendor provided training, and industry provided training. The District also has a written policy on public notificat"
