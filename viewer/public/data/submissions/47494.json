Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\nThe management and employees of GRAINCO FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. \n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61,1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n4.  Five year accident history.\nThe following accident occurred at the facility in the last five years:\n          -    We had an accidental release of less than 10 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia resulting in \n               injury and hospitalization of an employee.  The employee slipped while holding the hose end valve.\n               The valve hand wheel struck the guardrail on the tank and liquid flowed onto the employee's \n                upper thigh and groin area.\n11-18-04 Accident: Employee lost his balance on ammonia riser and bumped the hose and valve opened up spraying ammonia in his eyes and face. The release incident lasted 15-20 seconds and was immediately shut off. We estimated that 1 gallon of product was lost. \n\n5.  The emergency response program.\nThe facilit"
