The container drops to the ground outside of the storage building and a catastophic failure occurs on impact, releasing the entire contents of the container onto the ground.  As the emergency response program is initiated, a chlorine cloud begins to form and drift off-site with the prevailing wind direction.\n\nThe EPA's RMP Comp (Version 1.07) was utilized to model the worst case scenario using the program's data elements to determine the distance to toxic end point.  No passive mitigation factors were considered for the worst-case scenario analysis.  Administrative controls, operating procedures, and design for the process limit the number of containers that can be connected to the process at any given time.  Thus, the worst-case scenario considers the maximum contents of one full container.\n\nPopulation estimates within the toxic end point (3.0 miles) were obtained using the RTK NET Landview 5 program (Version 1.0) and were confirmed using St. Charles County's census data and population density information.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was also developed to model a more realistic release than the worst-case scenario such as releases from joints, flanges, elbows, weld points, valves and other vessel appurtenances.\n\nThe following information summarizes and documents an alternate release scenario for the facility:\n\nScenario: A tubing or valve and yoke assembly connection fails releasing liquid chlorine into the chlorine storage room floor from a horizontal 2,000 pound container.  The entire contents of the tank leaks onto the floor of the storage room floor forming a pool and begins to vaporize.  The release is a two-phase release occurring from a 5/16-inch diameter valve body opening.  The EPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance document was utilized to determine the alternative release scenario using the following standard assumptions:\n\nThe ambient relative humidity is 50%.\n\nThe ambient temperature of the surrounding air an"

In a gaseous state it is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air and will sink and conform to the contour of the ground in low lying areas.  As the gas spreads, it will become diluted with air depending on weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, etc.  As the gas becomes more diluted it will become neutrally bouyant and begin to travel with the main air streams.\n\nThis effect is particularly important to the PWSD #2 Water Plant because it is situated in a low lying area relative to the terrain immediately surronding the area.  It should be noted that the modeling programs and equations used to perform the worst-case and alternative release scenarios do not account for the extreme topography associated with the location of the facility.  Even if there is a prevailing cross-wind, the chlorine gas may tend to follow a depression due to its density.\n\nThe heavier-than-air gas behavior can also be used as an advantage if ravines and downhill slopes lead to natural reservoirs such as a small creek or a lake.  It is important to recognize that these behaviors may be a much more accurate tool for predictin"

PWSD #2 and its employees are committed to achieving this goal through the implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The benefits of this program are intended to provide a safer workplace for employees and a safer environment for the community.\n\nBecause PWSD#2 exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency's threshold of 2,500 pounds, a Program 3level RMP has been developed to meet regulatory requirements.  Procedures for implementing and maintaining the RMP program are contained within this document.\n\nThe Water Plant Supervisor along with the assistance of the District Manager have the primary responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP program.\n\nThe facility provides potable water to customers throughout St. Charles County.  The Facility consists of a well field of nine wells, a single-stage water softening treatment plant and approximately 8.0 million gallons of finished water storage.  The plant has a water supply capacity of approximately 22.4 million gallons per day.\n\nThe subject of the PWSD #2 Water Plant Risk Management Plan involves the use and storage of hazardous chemicals involved in the water treatment and disinfection process.  Currently, chlorine is the only chemical being stored and used in excess of the threshold quantity for chlorine in accordance with Section 112A&reg; of the Clean Air Act.\n\nChlorine is a Toxic gas which is stored as a liquid under pressure.  The Maximum intended inventory at any given time that the plant could store is approximately 16,000 pounds.

Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will tend to travel along the ground topography filling spaces, pits, and displacing breathable air.  Chlorine is also highly toxic to aquatic life.  The chlorine storage area for this facility is located in a separate storage building adjacent to areas of normal operating personnel.\n\nChlorine gas is injected in to the water at the hydrotreator, pre-filtration, and post-filtration stages in the process to chemically disinfect along with other water treatment chemicals prior to distribution into the public water supply system.  The chlorine is delivered to the process from 2,000 pound steel containers via a regulated vacuum system which allows operators of the system to control the rate of flow of chlorine into the water system.\n\nIn Accordance with CFR Part 68, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) has been performed to determine and document the facilities RMP program eligibility and to meet the EPA hazard assesment requirements for the applicable program.This OCA defines the toxic end point in all directions for worst-case and alternative release scenarios based on the applicable EPA guidance documents, modeling software, current available U.S. Census Bureau data, and available mapping tools.  Mapping and census figures from St. Charles County were also used to determine the population that would be affected in worst-case and alternate release scenarios.

When a leak occurs in a container or piping system, the quick reduction in pressure that occurs would cause the liquid chlorine to vaporize as it is released into the atmosphere.  The remainder of the liquid would pool and vaporize as it is warmed by environmental conditions.  When chlorine changes state from a liquid to a vapor, it expands to approximately 450 times the liquid volume.  Therefore, a release of chlorine liquid poses a significantly greater risk than a chlorine gas leak from a similar d vessel, pipe, or leak point.\n\nIt is the intention of the PWSD #2 Water Plant to minimize or eliminate the risk of an accidental release of a hazardous substance by utilizing the RMP program as a managerial tool to maintain and improve its internal operations, maintenance, and training programs which already currently exist.\n\nThe PWSD #2 Water Plant has developed an Emergency Response Program as part of the RMP program.  The purpose of this ensures that the PWSD  #2 Water Plant maintains current and complete written emergency action plans (EAP's) and effective response capabilities for all RMP covered processes.  The EAP, combined with effective emergency response drills and training, will hopefully minimize the impact of an accidental release by ensuring that the facility has a quick, well-organized response.  Currently the scope of the plan only includes releases of liquid chlorine, chlorine gas, and chlorinated water which may occur within the facilities boundaries.\n\nIt has been determined by the PWSD #2 Water Plant that any major releases which impact off-site receptors or cannot be handled by the facility response team will be coordinated by the St. Charles County Hazardous Material Response Plan - Annex H (Revised January 2004) which is carried out by the St. Charles County Local Emergency Planning Commissio"
