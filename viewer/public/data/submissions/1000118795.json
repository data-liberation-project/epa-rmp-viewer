Wichita Water Works has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases. Wichita Water Works has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant in conjunction with the Wichita Fire Department and the Sedgwick County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\nThe Facility has a disinfection process that has the capacity to store 120,000 pounds of liquid chlorine. The threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds. Chlorine is the only RMP covered substance at the Facility.\n\nThe Facility is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the disinfection process. These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits. The PSM/RMP program for the Facility consists of the following documents:\n\nVolume 1\tPolicy and Procedure Manual \nThis Manual presents an introduction to each of the 14 management system elements, the background of each elements\u0092 development, policies and procedures related to each element, and how the Facility documents implementation of the program.\n\nAppendix A to Volume 1 contains Operating Procedures required by the PSM/RMP regulations for the chlorine disinfection process, as well as Safe Work Practices for tasks associated with  operation of the process. Operating Procedures are developed for each piece of equipment in the process and each of the required operating phases. Appendix A also contains inspection an"

The RMP and hazard assessment will be updated and resubmitted every five years.\n\nAppendix A to Volume 2 includes a copy of the RMP submitted to EPA through the Central Data Exchange (CDX) using RMP*eSubmit\n\nAppendix B to Volume 2 documents the initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) that was conducted and will include any subsequent updates and revalidations. The PHA report documents the team, methodology, and actions taken to address the team\u0092s findings and recommendations. The PHA will be revalidated or updated every five years.\n\nVolume 3\tProcess Safety Information\nContains the Process Safety Information (PSI) required to be compiled by the PSM/RMP regulations for the chlorine disinfection process. The PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the chemicals in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process. \n\nThe Facility is newly constructed, and this is the initial RMP submittal. There have been no incidents during construction or commissioning that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nThe Facility has trained responders onsite for small releases and relies on the Wichita Fire Department for more extensive releases.\n\nWichita Water Works has a strong safety program both at the plant and throughout the organization. At this time, the Facility has no additional changes planned to improve safety at the plant."
