A wholly owned subsidiary of Acid Products Company Inc., Prairie Packaging is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) utilizing a Quality Management System that is registered per ISO 9001:2008. \n\n\n\nAt Prairie Packaging LLC, bulk commodity chemicals are adjusted to specified concentrations, blended, and/or repackaged into smaller containers such as totes, drums, pails, and/or liter bottles. These products are then distributed to numerous industries in the surrounding area, including; automotive, electronics, aerospace, food and drug, cosmetics, cleaning, and those involved with water treatment. In addition to the many proprietary blended products that are manufactured and distributed specifically for general home use.\n\n\n\nAt Prairie Packaging LLC, safety is the top priority. A fact that is readily evident by our comprehensive training program which ensures each employee presently operating an affected process, and/or critical piece of equipment, has been trained and tested as being fully competent as it pertains to their duties. Prairie Packaging LLC certifies this in writing and diligently monitors each employee to ensure they continue to maintain the required skills, knowledge, and abilities to safely perform their daily duties. \n\n\n\nThis commitment to excellence, in combination with Prairie Packaging's relatively remote location (fenced in on > 260 acres), is arguably one of the best sites one may hope to find in order to safely manage RMP listed chemicals. In fact, this was effectively the same conclusion the U.S. Military made when the location was first identified and engineered specifically for military ordinance manufacturing. \n\n\n\nThis specially constructed facility affords Prairie Packaging the ability to completely segregate the RMP listed product into individual concrete/steel holding bays that are devoid of any power, "

Thus, eliminating any credible scenarios whereby other products or processes warrant concern.\n\n\n\nHowever, as such containers are routinely handled and as part of the transportation process, it is felt prudent to take this into consideration. And since the greatest frequency of material handling occurs at our back docks, we have selected this area for our focus point. \n\n\n\nHence, entertaining a \"co-location\" scenario in which a \"skid\" is being moved/staged and three full drums (i.e. vessels) fall off simultaneously. Further, that they then begin leaking from their \"bungs\" which have somehow been \"shaken loose\" in transit. Then the combined volume (adjusted for concentration) of such leaking containers might potentially exceed the RMP threshold planning quantity. \n\n\n\nAnd if such \"co-located vessels\" could not be immediately \"up-righted\" (from resting on their sides); then response and mitigation would be handled via an elite team of Emergency Responder's (as per the terms of our contract). A team that is always on call (24/7 - 365), being fully equipped/prepared to handle such situations on a moment's notice.  \n\n\n\nAlthough, to the best our knowledge, such a scenario suggested above has never transpired before (at any time or place), if everything went wrong that could, then one might consider this as being plausible. Even so, a couple of points for additional consideration would be that any spilled material would basically result in extensive damage to the cement floor (as the cement would effectively begin neutralizing the liquid). And being in an enclosed building, at least 90% of any associated fumes would also be contained to that area. Taking all of this into account, a scenario such as this would have absolutely no reasonable chance of ever extending beyond the fenced in property line.\n\n\n\nFortunately, in over five years since Prairie Packing LLC f"
