Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Muskegon personnel. Release-reporting procedures are contained in Muskegon's manufacturing process units which prescribe immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the state and local emergency planning centers (LEPC' s), local fire and police departments, and other interested parties.  The site maintains an emergency response team at the awareness level with appropriate training.  \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Muskegon Site is located 2 miles north of Muskegon, MI.  The site has a total area of 200 acres, which 20 acres are developed.\n\nBayer CropScience has one production process at this site that is covered by the RMP rule.  It is the Glufosinate Ammonia (GA)/Liberty? process.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a raw material for the GA production.  The GA/Liberty process produces a herbicide.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nManaging Process Safety at the Muskegon Site requires proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  We endorse and maintain an effective process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements whi"

      "SummaryText": "ch impact the process are all considered in the evaluation. The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated and strengthened as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level. Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees and others to serious hazards.  Elements in the accident prevention program include programs such as: Management of Change, Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA) Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits and Permits To Work for Bayer employees and contractors.\n\nIn regard to specific chemicals and processes regulated under RMP, the processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control or prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\n\nAccidental releases from these processes are prevented by studying the hazards of the processes to identify potential hazards and implementing procedures, installing control devices and systems, and providing training to control those hazards.  The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary. \n\nIn addition to skilled operators, all of the processes are controlled by computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the processes and make adjustments accordingly.  In addition to the control systems, several of the processes are equipped with redundant computer safety systems which act to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded and other process are equipped with direct shutdown controls to achieve si"

      "SummaryText": "milar protection.  All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers to reduce emissions from the process to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases. In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event that an accidental release does occur, it investigated to determine the root causes and to prescribe corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring in the future.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe GA/Liberty process at the Muskegon site has had zero accidental releases from RMP-covered processes that meet the RMP reporting criteria during the last five years.  Please note that for the past 4 years this process has been ?moth-balled? and not been in production. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDue to the small employment levels at the Muskegon site, the Muskegon site relies on local first responders (i.e.: local fire department and HazMat Team) for assistance.  The site has a site-wide notification system in place in the event of an emergency.\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are many operating and mechanical changes that continuously occur to improve Bayer CropScience facilities. These occur as a result of the periodic risk-based process hazardous analysis review process."
