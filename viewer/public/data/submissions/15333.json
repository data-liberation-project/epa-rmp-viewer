Personnel have been trained on how to respond to spill or leak events and a maintenance program is in effect to prevent the occurrence of spills or leaks.  The hydrofluoric acid tank is monitored daily by facility staff and by plant security personnel.  Additionally, the tank is inspected annually for wall thickness and hardness.  Tests have always shown the tank to be structurally sound.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThough a Worst Case Scenario release is possible, its occurrence is highly improbable.  Therefore, EPA asks all affected facilities to generate an Alternative Release Scenario that describes a more probable release occurrence that can impact areas beyond facility boundaries.\n\nSince the 70% hydrofluoric acid storage system consists of only a storage tank and its associated piping, a probable alternative occurrence was determined to be a leak in the tank or piping.  A review of the storage systems accident history revealed that only two incidents (September 24, 1996 and May 3, 1997) have occurred in the last five years.\n\nDuring the first incident, only 2 to 5 gallons of 70% acid leaked from a pipe flange into the HF acid tank containment dike.  No effects were noted on-site or off-site from this leak to individuals, property or the environment other than a reported minor tingling of the skin on the leg of one emergency responder.  This individual was treated as a precaution.  The second incident involved a squirt of acid released during a maintenance operation.  A maintenance worker was burned on the arm by the HF acid and subsequently, treated.\n\nNeither of these leak events provides what is felt to be a good alternative scenario, so management is using a hypothetical event that could have off-site impacts"

      "SummaryText": ".  The chosen Alternative Release Scenario consists of an event in which 1 gallon per minute of 70% hydrofluoric acid is leaked from a pipe, over a one hour period before discovery, to an area outside the storage tank containment dike.  EPA's modeling software, RMP Comp was used to calculate this event's toxic endpoint.  This endpoint was found to extend in a circle to a 0.20 mile radius from the storage tank location.\n\nA residential population of 32 people was estimated to lie within this radius as well as a part of the Whitehall Industrial Park property.  No environmental receptors are located within this radius.\n\nAgain, due to Howmet Corporation's concerns about this 70% acid, certain precautions have been taken minimize spill impacts; personnel are incident response trained, a maintenance program is in effect, and daily area inspections are performed.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe RMP rule requires Howmet Corporation to implement a Program 2 level Risk Management Program.  The following narrative briefly describes the elements of The Howmet Corporation Risk Management Program for the Ti-Cast hydrofluoric acid storage system.\n\nSafety Information\nHowmet Corporation maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the hydrofluoric acid storage system.  Included are Material Safety Data Sheets that describes the inherent hazards and recommended precautions for the management of this material.  Safety information materials are supplied to appropriate personnel and area hospitals that define specialized HF acid exposure treatment procedures.  Contractors are trained in HF safety procedures.\n\nHazard Review\nHowmet Corporation performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the HF acid storage process to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard process review.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nTi-Cast developed and maintains operating p"

Workers who perform operations involving HF acid receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for HF acid developed by AlliedSignal, Inc.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nHowmet Corporation maintains a 5-year accident history for the HF storage system that fulfills the requirements of the RMP rule.  The RMP rule defines accidents to include events that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site.  The Ti-Cast operation HF storage system had two accidents (incidents) in the past 5 years.  These accidents were previously noted in the Alternative Release Scenario portion of this report.  The releases resulted in a potential injury to the skin of one spill responder and an arm burn to a maintenance worker in a separate incident.  Both individuals were treated.\n\nEmergency Response Programs\nThe Howmet Corporation Whitehall facilities have a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plan regulations.  This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local police and fire departments.  Regular dialogue is maintained between Howmet Corporation and the local officials, and Howmet Corporation provides appropriate information to them."

Since the potential exists for off-site consequences from a release of hydrogen fluoride vapors, the storage area falls under RMP Program 2 prevention requirements.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe intent of this document is to inform the public that a spill of 70% hydrofluoric acid could affect the community to some degree depending on the extent of the release of acid.  At present, 70% acid can only be accidentally released from two fixtures, the 6,500-gallon storage tank and its associated piping.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case release of 70% hydrofluoric acid is described here as the Worst Case Scenario.  Such a release could occur if the entire maximum operating contents (5,000-gallons) of 70% hydrofluoric acid were released from the storage tank to the diked containment area.  This dike limits the surface area of the acid pool and reduces the amount of vapors that will be emitted.  Thus only 6.16 pounds per minute of hydrogen fluoride vapors will evolve to the air in the event of a worst case spill.  This is based on computations using EPA's RMP Comp modeling software.\n\nEPA has determined that hydrogen fluoride fumes can have a toxic effect down to a concentration as low as 0.016 mg/L.  The extent of maximum toxic effect or the toxic endpoint for the emission of hydrogen fluoride vapors to the atmosphere, that would be released under worst case conditions, was calculated to extend in a circle to a 0.30 mile radius from the storage tank location.  Again, this calculation was made using the EPA's RMP Comp dispersion modeling software.\n\nA residential population of up to 72 people was estimated to lie within this radius as well as a part of the Shoreline Elementary School property (but not the school itself) and a part of the Whitehall Industrial Park property.  No environmental receptors are located within this radius.  U.S. Bureau of the Census, LandView III Software was used to calculate the affected residential population.\n\nBecaus"

      "SummaryText": "are in operation 5-7 days per week.  On a typical day, over 2,500 people are on the various sites.\n\nVarious hazardous materials are used in the manufacturing processes.  Included among them is hydrofluoric acid.  This material is used to chemically mill cast titanium aircraft components.  Hydrofluoric acid is regulated as a toxic substance under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Howmet Corporation has therefore, developed this RMP to address those requirements.\n\n\nHYDROFLUORIC ACID PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n70% hydrofluoric acid is transported to the Ti-Cast facility (Plant 5) in Whitehall by tanker truck and is transferred to a single 6,500-gallon outdoor, storage tank.  This tank has a limited maximum storage capacity of 5,000 gallons.  This steel tank is located on a coated concrete pad and is contained within a coated concrete dike that can hold 150% of the tank's 6,500 gallon design volume (9,750-gallons) in the event of a spill from the tank.\n\nThe acid is transfered from the tank to the adjoining building.  An argon gas blanket is used to force the acid through piping to the hydrofluoric acid process tanks.  There the acid is diluted to a 10% or less concentration.  At this point, the acid no longer presents air emissions concern due to the low acid concentration.\n\nSubsequently, titanium alloy castings are immersed in this 10% or less hydrofluoric acid solution to remove brittle, oxygen enriched layer found on the surface of the castings.  This treatment improves the durability of these aerospace application castings.\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires facilities that store greater than 1,000 pounds of hydrogen fluoride in a process, in concentration of 50% hydrofluoric acid solution or greater, to implement an RMP program to reduce the risks inherent in the use of this material.  The Ti-Cast storage tank system holds a maximum of 5,000 gallons of 70% HF acid.  This has an equivalent weight of 35,600 lbs. of hydrogen fluoride and therefore, exceeds RMP pla"
