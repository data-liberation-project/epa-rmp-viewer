This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The CWTP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. \n4.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance \nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines.  The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 20,000 pounds of chlorine kept in ten (10) one-ton containers.  Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by high and low chlorine sensor alarms to control room with an audible and visual alarm system.  \n4.3\tHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \nThe Off-site Consequence Analysis must be reviewed every five years or within six months of process changes or other changes that may significantly affect the results of the Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n4.4\tRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the CWTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety pr"

The facility has chlorine detectors that activate a Scrubber System.\n4.5\tAccidental Release Prevention Program \nAs part of the implementation of the CalARP/EPA RMP Program for the Chlorination System, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by CWTP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine for water treatment.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe facility maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 20,000 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 2,500-lbs. threshold for EPA RMP, the 1,500-lbs. threshold for Cal/OSHA PSM and the 100-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the chlorine covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.1 Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.2 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.3 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.4 Training (TRN)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.5 Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.6 Management of Change (MOC)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.7 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.8 Compliance Audits (CA)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.9 Incident Investigation (II)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.10 Employee Participation (EP)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.11 Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\u00bf\t19 CCR \u00a7 2760.12 Contractors (CON)\nIn addition, key emergency res"

The CWTP has submitted a Hazardous Materials Business Plan in order to coordinate with the local emergency planning and response agencies to ensure that in an event of an emergency they are properly prepared and have knowledge of the system.\n4.8\tExternal Events Analysis\nGeneral events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of chlorine were addressed by the PHA.  \n4.9\tPlanned Changes To Improve Safety \nThe Compliance Audit has been conducted to examine any deficiencies at the Program 3 facility improve the safety program.
