The result of the release would have an offsite impact.  EPA\u00bfs OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, which further reduces the likelihood of this occurring.\n\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR112 (Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures), RCRA, and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the proactive identification, evaluate, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.

There have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances, which resulted in offsite effects.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training, which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs that are on the market today.

This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility.  This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility, in cooperation with local response agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONA SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Bridger Lake Plant is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane, and a pentane-natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to a market via pipeline and/or trucks.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \u00bf WORST CASE SCENARIO:\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere; having an offsite impact.  EPA\u00bfs OCA Guidance was used to calculate this release scenario.  This type of scenario is very unlikely to occur.
