      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nSuperior Pipeline Company, LLC. (SPC) owns and operates a natural gas liquids recovery facility, the Spring Creek Gas Processing Plant, in Grant County, Oklahoma. The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, refrigeration, and expansion. Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas.  Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Spring Creek plant because it handles and stores process flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities. SPC management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  The Spring Creek plant has no recordable accidents in the past five years.   \n\nSPC has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident.  In this case, the \"worst case\" would be a complete release from the 30,000 gallon NGL storage tank, resulting in instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes. Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the potential radius of impact, due to the explosion, was calculated to extend 0.4 miles. Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 1 mile radius.  The worst case event would affect zero (0) nearby structures, and it was determined that the nearest public receptor is greater than six-tenths (0.6) of a mile from the tank.  A consideration of the 0.4 mile radius is incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nSPC implements safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are being implemented.  In addition, SPC has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Medford Fire "
