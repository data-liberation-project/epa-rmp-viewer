All levels of management ensures that the employees are working in a safe environment and training of PPE and work processes are provided on a regular basis.  Employees are routinely instructed through classroom, hands-on, and on-the-job hazards associated with chemicals at their site and how to prevent any potential injury or environmental impact.\r\n     This is a Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) Facility that has a design capacity of 1.6 mgd.  The process includes mechnical bar screen, surge tank, process tanks, secondary clarifiers, and chemical treatment that includes the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The sludge is processed through thickeners, aerobic digestion, and belt presses for land application or landfill disposal.\r\n     The worst-case and alternative release scenarios were determined through use of the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables and Equations.  In the worst-case scenario, we took into consideration of a full 1 ton container rupturing on site with total discharge within 10 minutes.  Due to the location of the facility, there were potential off-site mitigation concerns that could impact primarily the prison compound, with little environmental impact.  The chlorine systems are checked multiple times throughout the day, and any concerns are immediately addressed.  With the enclosure, the containers are away from potential damage to structural integrity of the container and the daily checks make the worst-case scenario unlikely to occur.  The facility is at a lower elevation from the prison complex, which would also reduce the potential for toxic vapors to disseminate towards the complex.  The alternative case scenario was selected due to the likelhood for a malfunction of a fitting.  This release would be minimal and enclosed within the building.  Operations staff w"

The training provided to employees and the posting of changing procedures readily accessible to employees also enhances preventive steps for safety.  This has resulted in not having any accident history with chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Employees are trained in containing any type of chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak, but personnel are informed to contact the emergency services immediately.  MES emergency response personnel will be able to control the situation as well as any potential mitigation concerns.\r\n     The employees at this facility are periodically retrained in the usage of PPE and emergency repair kits that could assist in containment and control.  Safety is a top priority to all personnel and we continually develop/update programs due to technology changes and employee safety needs."
