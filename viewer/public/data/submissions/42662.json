Refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2, which are on contiguous properties and not adjacent to Area 3.  A separate RMP submittal has been prepared for Areas 1 and 2.\n\nThe purpose of the RMP program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \u00bfregulated substances\u00bf that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  \u00bfRegulated substances\u00bf are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA. BWC has quantities of various \u00bfregulated substances\u00bf above threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC Area 3\nSection 3: Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n \nSection 1.

The results of the analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in its emergency response planning.\n\n3.1  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nBWC conducted offsite consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines (OCAG).  This methodology was used because the RMP rule set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  The worst case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified \u00bfendpoint\u00bf.  As defined by the rule, the endpoint for toxics substances is a specified concentration, and for flammables is a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  \n\nThe worst-case scenario for a regulated flammable substance is one where the total quantity of regulated flammable in the largest vessel or pipe is spilled instantaneously and allowed to vaporize over a 10 minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nA summary of the worst-case scenario for BWC Area 3 is provided in Table 2.  As required by the RMP rule, the results are sh"

These scenarios are more realistic than the worst-case scenario for assessing the potential hazards posed by BWC process units and developing emergency response plans.  Although these scenarios may be unlikely to occur, they are physically possible and reasonably feasible.  \n\nEPA OCAG procedures were not used for modeling the alternative release scenarios.  More flexibility is provided for in characterizing releases and assessing the impacts for the alternative release scenarios.  The \u00bfPHAST Professional\u00bf model by DNV Technica for the ARS was used.  PHASTProfessional is an advanced consequence modeling program that examines the progress of a potential incident from initial release, through the formation of a cloud and/or liquid pool, and on to final dispersion and flammable/toxic effects. \n\nA summary of the alternative release scenarios for BWC Area 3 is provided in Table 3.

BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis section describes the general accident prevention programs in place at BWC.  This program is required for all level 3 covered process units described in Section 2, Table 1, and is applied throughout the facility.\n\nEmployees are responsible for implementing the prevention elements for his/her department as follows:\n\nSafety Group:  Process Hazards Analyses, Compliance Audits, Employee Participation, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Procedure, Emergency Response\n\nTraining Department:  Operating Procedures, Employee Training \n\nOperations Department:  Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Incident Investigation\n\nMaintenance Department:  Contractors\n\nProduction Services Department:  Mechanical Integrity\n\nProject Engineering:  Process Safety Information\n\nSite Manager:  Incident Investigation\n\nAll records associated with the prevention elements and the Risk Management Program are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nBWC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the process units.  Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, limits for specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analyses, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.  This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance a"

Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  BWC has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery\u00bfs primary process hazards analysis technique.  Some of the revalidation has been done using the \u00bfwhat if\u00bf and risk matrix methodologies.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, BWC updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every five years.  \n\nAs part of the technical studies, BWC conducted a seismic review of the refinery.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company.  The objective of seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substance having off-site consequence would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nBWC has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.\n\nThe"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual certification.\n\n4.4  Training\n\nBWC\u00bfs general policy requires operating personnel to be trained in the safe operation of facilities, handling process upsets, emergency response, and personal safety.  Employees who understand the process and how to safely operate a process can significantly decrease the number and severity of incidents.  \n\nRefresher training for all operations and maintenance employees in Safety, Health, and Environmental subjects and operating procedures (as appropriate) is provided at varying intervals, depending upon requirements. \n\n4.5  Management of Change\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) review is required for modifications to facilities or changes to process unit operating conditions.  The procedure does not apply to \u00bfreplacement in kind\u00bf which is defined as replacements that satisfy the design specifications. \n\nThe MOC process is intended to assess the impact of proposed changes on process safety, the environment, operability, reliability, and product quality in process units.  The requirements for Management of Change are documented in a written procedure.  Management of Change information is kept for the life of the process unit.\n\n4.6  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional assurance that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.
