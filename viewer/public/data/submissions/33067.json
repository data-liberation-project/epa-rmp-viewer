      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n    The Thief River Falls Water Treatment Plant Risk\nManagement Plan was developed to protect both the \nresidents of the community and Water Department personnel \nthrough policy and procedures governing the operation of \nthe facility.  This plan is a cooperative effort of plant \nstaff, administration, and City Government.  It is based \non the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management, \nUSEPA Risk Management, and Minnesota's Workplace Accident \nand Incident Reduction (AWAIR) law requirement.\n    The commitment of the City of Thief River Falls City \nCouncil is demonstrated by the Thief River Falls Employee \nSafety Committee.  This is an independent committee \nreporting directly to the City Council.  It includes \nsupervisory, department head, union personal and two City \nCouncil members who take an active role in addressing \nsafety issues and concerns for all City employees.\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n    The Thief River Falls Water Treatment Plant uses \ngaseous chlorine and anhydrous ammonia for disinfection of \nthe drinking water supplied to the community.  The \nanhydrous ammonia inventory is maintained below the \nminimum quantities as required by OSHA PSM and EPA RMP \nrequirements.  Maximum quantity is 560 pounds.\n    The WTP Chlorine inventory control procedure calls for \nthe chlorine inventory to be maintained between 500 and \n3000 pounds, using cylinders of one ton capacity.  When \nthe on-line chlorine cylinder is reduced to approximately \n1000 pounds, another cylinder is ordered.  The replacement \ncylinder is delivered before the on-line cylinder reaches \n500 pounds.  This procedure limits the amount of chlorine \non site to a maximum of one full cylinder and one partial \ncylinder.  The purpose of this policy is to maintain an \nadequate inventory of chlorine for disinfection while \nlimiting WTP operator and public exposure to a accidental \nchlorine release.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n    Worst-case and alternative relea"

No \nactive mitigation measures or devices, such as scrubbers, \ncould be considered for analysis of worst-case releases.\n    For this worst-case scenario, the regulation specifies \nthe release conditions and meteorological conditions at \nthe time of the release.  When these conditions were \nmodeled, using the USEPA Off Site Consequence Analysis, \nthe results were as follows:\n\n    Worst-case release scenario:\n    *  Quantity released = 2000 pounds\n    *  Release duration = 10 minutes\n    *  Release rate = 200 pounds per minute\n    *  Distance to endpoint = 2.2 miles\n\n\n    For the alternative release scenario, the following\n    results were obtained:\n    *  Quantity release = 317 pounds\n    *  Release duration = 60 minutes\n    *  Release rate = 10.6 pounds per minute\n    *  Distance to end point = leaking gas contained in\n                               the storage room.

This is a mechanical integrity program requiring \nannual inspection of all hazardous chemical equipment.  \nCertain equipment components require monthly inspections.  \nThe schedule is based on and adjusted according to actual \ninspection and test results.  Components such as gas \npressure regulators, feeder master control units"

In addition, \nthe chemical feed process equipment has redundancy to \nprovide back-up equipment operation while problem \nequipment is in repair or inspection.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    There have been no reportable release incidents in the \nhistory of the Thief River Falls Water Treatment Plant.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n    Response to a leak is by plant personnel trained in \nmitigation of chlorine leaks, using self contained \nbreathing apparatus, personal protection equipment, and a \nchlorine Emergency Kit \"B\" system.\n    Evacuation of surrounding population, and back up \nsafety personnel for the plant operators, is provided by \nthe Thief River Falls Fire Department and local Law \nEnforcement Center officers.\n    A leak in the chlorine system, as signaled by either \nof two chlorine detectors, triggers the start up of the \nchlorine scrubber system and triggers the WTP alarm \nsystem.  This provides notification to the plant operator \nto implement the Water Treatment Plant Emergency Response \nPlan .\n    The chlorine storage room is designed to contain a \nchlorine leak in the room while the scrubber neutralizes \nthe gas or liquid release.  The scrubber is designed to \nneutralize 2000 pounds of chlorine as either a liquid, \ngas, or both.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n    Employee input on improved safety and operations is \nencouraged and requested as a matter of City Policy.\n    Training of WTP staff is conducted in-house, and at \nseminars and workshops sponsored by the Minnesota Section \nof the American Water Works Association, Minnesota Rural \nWater Association, and the Minnesota Department of Health.\nThese seminars also provide a netwo"
