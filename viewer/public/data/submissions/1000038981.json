Fresh Mark Cold Storage's directors, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. Fresh Mark Cold Storage has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances. In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases. The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation. Fresh Mark Cold Storage will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehouse facility. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various areas of the facility. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system and is comprised of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps, heat exchangers and condensers. The ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are high and low pressure and level automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur. The ammonia refrigeration system is monitored by a computerized system. Each system is linked to a twenty-four hours a day third-party alarm monitoring company.  \n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Cold Storage has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.

Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards. Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with highly hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nFresh Mark Cold Storage has not had a reportable accidental release of ammonia during the last five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Team is trained to respond to releases and effectively minimize the release. Training for the Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Team is conducted at least annually.\n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include: improved maintenance procedures and periodicity, addition of new technology as it becomes available and continued training of facility and response personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
