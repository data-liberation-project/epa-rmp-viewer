LA PORTE PLANT RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAt Braskem America's La Porte Plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of improvements made at the facility to minimize the potential for accidental chemical releases that could adversely affect our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n* Certifications in accordance with RMP rule\n\n* Relevant details about the facility's risk management program\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nOur facility contains 2 covered processes.  \n\n\n\nThe first process produces polypropylene using multiple chemicals and unit operations. The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance propylene along with catalysts, hydrogen and ethylene as feedstocks. The process contains the RMP-regulated substance propylene above the threshold quantity in storage vessels, reactors, columns, tanks and piping within the unit. The process also utilizes titanium tetrachloride and triethyl aluminum in quantities well below the RMP threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe second process produces ethylene using chemicals and unit operations.  The process utilizes the regulated flammable substance ethane along with catalysts and methane a"

All other substances in the process are well below the RMP threshold quantity. \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards to employees, the public, and the environment otherwised posed by these chemicals.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of the accident release and prevention program at the Braskem La Porte facility is Process Safety Management. This is a fully comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n* Process safety information\n\n* Process hazard analysis\n\n* Operating procedures\n\n* Training\n\n* Mechanical integrity\n\n* Management of change\n\n* Pre-startup safety review\n\n* Compliance audits\n\n* Incident investigation\n\n* Employee participation\n\n* Hot work permit\n\n* Contractors\n\n\n\nWe actively encourage participation by all employees in process safety management. Relevant process safety information is readily available to employees. Employees participate in PHA revalidation studies and PHA studies consistent with our Management of Change Program. Procedures provide knowledge to ensure employees perform their jobs safely and correctly. Employee suggestions for improvement are encouraged. Experienced employees are involved in training. Employees and contractors are trained and are included in the investigation of incidents and accidents.\n\n\n\nAs prescribed by our Management of Change procedure, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews ensure that new installations or modifications are safe for startup and continued oper"

The La Porte Plant's Hot Work Permit procedure is consistently enforced to prevent hot work in potentially dangerous areas.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to minimize accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business. We have established specific accountabilities and controls in support of our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. In the past five years, there have been no releases of propylene, ethylene, or other chemicals at the La Porte Plant that have had an adverse impact on employees, the community, or the environment. If an incident were to occur, we would conduct formal incident investigations designed to identify and address the root cause.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nWe have developed and maintain an emergency response plan which includes planning and training elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and community emergency response plans (LEPC).\n\n\n\nRECENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we have implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n- VPP STAR site, completed 3 year re-certification in 2013\n\n- Implemented Behavior Based Safety Process in 2004 (ongoing and evergreen)\n\n- Implemented Total Event Reporting in 2004 (ongoing and evergreen)\n\n- Upgraded Emergency Operations Center (ongoing and evergreen)\n\n- Acquired new Site fire truck with foam agents 2008\n\n- Plant alarm system with voice notificati"

A number of programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. The facility maintains employee safety teams that meet regularly and a structured safety process.\n\n\n\n- Restructure the behavior-based Structured Safety Program (SMP) using TIPS 2 Software\n\n- Revise and standardize the LOTO Energy Isolation Program to include equipment specific checklists with capability to print specific DNO tags and pre-populate the EIF documents.\n\n\n\nADDITION OF SECOND PROCESS AND REVISION OF SITE MAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility added ethylene production as a second process, requiring an increase in the intended maximum on-site inventory of ethane to 24,000 lbs. This addition of a second process at the site does not change the maximum on-site propane inventory of 170,000 lbs or the maximum propylene quantity of 2.5 mmlbs as analyzed through the prior RMP.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario, previously evaluated for the site through the RMP, was based on the release of 424,295 lbs of liquefied flammable hydrocarbons (100% propylene) from a 12.5' ID x 113' long horizontal storage tank at the maximum liquid level of 100%. The analysis of this worst case scenario demonstrates that the radius of impact at 1 psi is significantly short of the nearest residents. The addition of the second process does not result in a change in the projected worst case scenario for the site.\n\n"
