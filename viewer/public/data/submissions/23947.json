      "SummaryText": "1096 LDEQ Facility ID Number\nMonsanto operates several manufacturing units, owned by three different companies: Monsanto Company, Rhodia Inc., and Occidental Chemical, at its Luling Plant. Monsanto, the site operator, submitted the initial Risk Management Plan to EPA on June 18, 1999, and then updated the Plan on March 9, 2000 to reflect a significant inventory reduction of anhydrous ammonia. This submittal is to remove two RMP regulated process units as a result of dismantling the Ammonina Storage and Recovery Unit and decommissioning the HPL Unit.   \n                                                                                                                                                              \nMonsanto is a global provider of technology-based solutions and agricultural products for growers and downstream customers, such as grain processors and consumers, in the agricultural markets. The combination of the Company's herbicides, seeds and related genetic trait products provides growers with integrated solutions to more efficiently and cost-effectively produce crops at higher yields, while controlling weeds, insects and diseases. We are committed to pursuing these goals ls in sustainable ways that meet people's needs without compromising future generation's ability to meet their needs.\n\nOne of the locations contributing to this vision is Monsanto's Luling manufacturing plant, located at 12501 River Road in Luling, Louisiana.  This facility manufactures Roundup brand herbicide, acetaminophen, and ACL brand active chlorine.  As part of operations, the facility handles sufficient quantities of chlorine,  formaldehyde, phosphorus trichloride and isopropylamine to require compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.\n\nThe major elements of the RMP prevention program are very similar to OSHA\u00bfs PSM regulation. OSHA has conducted an audit of our facility under their Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and has twice awarded their highest rating - Star."

      "SummaryText": "Receipt of this award demonstrates our commitment to the safety and health of employees and the surrounding community as well as protection of the environment.\n\nOur location has a documented Emergency Response plan which includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events, including inclement weather, fire and toxic chemical releases.  There are personnel responsible for implementation of this procedure on site at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) and other appropriate organizations.\n\nShould an event occur:\nDEP is notified immediately.\nPlant personnel respond immediately.\nDEP determines possible community impact and takes appropriate action which could include no action, shelter-in-place, evacuation, or continual communications.\nMethods of communicating to the public include siren system, cable TV, radio, telephone alert system, and door-to-door.\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there has been no RMP defined accidental release event.\n\nBased on the type and number of RMP regulated substances present at this facility, six accidental release scenarios have been provided, one toxic worst case, one flammable worst case, three toxic alternatives, and one flammable alternative.  Scenario selection was made by knowledgeable plant personnel, and off-site impacts determined using EPA methodologies.  The worst case scenario for each chemical assumes the entire contents of a vessel is discharged  in a 10 minute period, which is highly unlikely and sometimes physically impossible.  Alternate scenarios should be more likely events.\n\nThe toxic worst case scenario is a release of phosphorus trichloride from a rail car.   There are three toxic alternate scenarios, one each for formaldehyde, chlorine and phosphorus trichlorid"
