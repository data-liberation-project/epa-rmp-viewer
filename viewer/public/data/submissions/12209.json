The tank and dike are in an enclosed building that limits the exposed surface area and reduces the release rate to .49 lb./min.  The distance to the impact endpoint is 106 ft.  There are no public receptors within 106 ft. of the vinyl acetate monomer tank.\n\nOur Cleveland, Ohio facility developed and employs procedures to control, manufacturing and equipment operation.  In addition, operating procedures have been developed to manage emergencies and prevent chemical spills.  Chemical storage tanks containing RMP chemicals are protected by concrete dikes, and some tanks are also enclosed in buildings. Transfers of raw materials and finished products are controlled by instrumentation integrated with various safety interlocks. \n \nThe emergency procedures were developed with local emergency responders to address any incidents that may occur.  Employees at McGean-Rohco are trained to notify the appropriate responders and other agencies as needed. These are listed in the McGean-Rohco Emergency Action Plan. \n\nWe have not experienced any accidental releases of RMP chemicals in the last five years.  \n\nMcGean-Rohco works closely with the Cuyahoga Heights Fire & Police Departments and with its neighbors in training and sharing of information.  Employees have received both on-and off-site training.  Employee training programs are in compliance with the required OSHA regulations and are conducted on a regular basis.  Drills are conducted with local fire departments, hazardous materials teams and industrial neighbors.

      "SummaryText": "Formaldehyde, Epichlorohydrin and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.  \n\nThe facility covered by the RMP submission includes eleven buildings located on a seventeen-acre site in Cleveland, Ohio.  Three of the buildings are devoted to processing chemicals.  One building contains administrative staff and the remaining buildings are used for warehousing or are vacant.  The manufacturing areas include standard chemical processing equipment, such as storage and mixing tanks, reactors, heat exchangers and pumps. \n\nThe EPA OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDANCE was used in determining if there could be offsite impact in a worst-case scenario.  A worst-case scenario model was developed for each of the three RMP regulated chemicals.  In each case, it was shown that there are no public receptors within the worst-case scenario consequence area.  A summary of each scenario is described below.\n\nFormaldehyde: In a worst case, the entire inventory of the formaldehyde tank, 6,308 gallons, is released into its dike and begins to evaporate.  The tank and dike are in an enclosed building that limits the exposed surface area and reduces the release rate to .09 lb./min.  The dike drains into a secondary containment tank that holds the entire inventory of the formaldehyde tank.  The distance to the impact endpoint is 53 ft.  There are no public receptors within 53 ft. of the formaldehyde tank.\n\nEpichlorohydrin: In a worst case, the entire inventory of the epichlorohydrin tank, 5,500 gallons, is released into its dike and begins to evaporate.  The tank holds 6,308 gallons, but by using administrative controls, the tank never contains more than 5,500 gallons.  The purchasing department established a maximum tank inventory of 400 gallons before epichlorohydrin can be ordered and a maximum order of 5,000 gallons.  This guarantees that the inventory will never  be greater than 5,400 gallons.  The dike limits the exposed surface area and reduces the release rate to .45 lb./min.  The distance to the impac"
