The overall emergency response program for Martin County is coordinated with the Martin County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Several local emergency responders that support Martin County include Martin County Emergency Services, the Martin County Sheriff, and the Martin County (Stanton) Fire Department.  The Martin County Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, Police and Sheriff's offices).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  Martin County is planning its first annual (2021) mock emergency drill that will involve local emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nAll incidents that occurred within the previous five years were reviewed to determine whether any are subject to RMP reporting.  There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances meeting the accident reporting criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a) during the prior five years at the Martin County Gas Plant.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWTG Martin County will continue to improve its safety and environmental performance through emphasis on the continued development of its PSM Program.  Improvement plans include process engineering support to update critical PSI data for the site; operating procedures written for each mode of operation and to include consequences of deviations; an operator certification training program established from the new operating procedures, new process hazard analysis (PHA) procedure and team structure ensuring employee involvement, new MI program incorporating the implementation of all new ins"

In WTG's general PSM/RMP improvement program initiatives, an updated audit protocol has been established and implemented within WTG.  \r\n\r\nHot Work Permit:\r\nHot work permits are in use and on file.

A review of the contractor's safety record both prior to selection and during their time of employment is being developed.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\nWith the enhancement of various PSM elements such as PSI, PHAs, operating procedures, PSSR, MI, MOC, incident investigations, etc., additional training (computer and classroom based) have been and will continue to be established to ensure all Martin County employees are knowledgeable in these processes.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe process at Martin County has hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.

Sweet inlet gas enters the plant from high-pressure field gathering stations.  Martin County treats and processes flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantity containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\r\n\u00bf\tMethane\r\n\u00bf\tEthane\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane\r\n\u00bf\tButane\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane\r\n\u00bf\tPentane\r\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Martin County, which is part of the liquid amine treating process, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Martin County Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Response Plan which all employees are trained on and have readily available in their control room.  WTG conducts drills and coordinates annual mock emergency simulations at the Facility in conjunction with the local responders.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Martin County process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.  WTG considers the systems developed for compliance with PSM to be the basis for good safety and business practices.  In this effort, WTG identifies op"

      "SummaryText": "portunities to continuously improve initiatives for each PSM element.  The PSM elements are implemented to satisfy the PSM/RMP requirements since the Martin County Gas Plant qualifies as a program level 3 RMP process.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nEmployee participation is the foundation block to an evergreen and integrated PSM program.  Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to the maximum intended inventory (MII) and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed.  Heat and material balances have been thoroughly documented.  A company-wide study is underway to ensure relief valves have been properly designed and sized for the specific application.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA new PHA team including experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives conducted a PHA revalidation from July 6, 2020 through August 6, 2020.  The final report was published December 11, 2020 and contains an accompanying list of action items.  A tentative completion date for all action items is June 30, 2022; however, this is subject to change.  Results and recommendations from these analyses have been actively shared with employees.  Additionally, a process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented for the interactive tracking of PHA action items to closure.  This tracking tool is used to generate reminders on a set frequency along with status updates of pending action items every month.\r\n\r\nOperat"
