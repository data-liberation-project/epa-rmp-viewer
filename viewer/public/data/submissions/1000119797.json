(Roquette) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Gurnee, IL facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nRoquette owns, operates, and controls hydrogen handling equipment (piping, valves, etc.) that is interconnected with a hydrogen storage system with a capacity greater than 10,000 pounds. The hydrogen storage system is owned, operated, and controlled by Praxair, Inc. (Praxair) and Roquette has no access to the storage system. More specifically, Praxair's storage system is located on the Roquette site and is inside a fenced area to which Roquette does not have access. Piping from the hydrogen storage system passes across the chain link fence and into Roquette's process.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nRoquette has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 for a program level 3 site. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nRoquette maintains a detailed record o"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Roquette maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nRoquette has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nRoquette carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Roquette to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and p"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nRoquette conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nRoquette promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nRoquette believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Roquette employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nRoquette has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [4"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Roquette has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Gurnee facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nThe Gurnee facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan that includes specific actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release, procedures for informing the public and local agencies, and information on emergency health care. The facility relies on the Gurnee Fire Department to respond to chemical releases and coordinates with them on a regular basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe Gurnee facility is committed to improving our safety systems by implementing recommendations identified from Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) and compliance audits.\n\nRoquette has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.
