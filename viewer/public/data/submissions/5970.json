The plant uses chlorine as a disinfection agent and sulfur dioxide as a dechlorination agent prior to disharge of the final effluent to Days Creek. The facility's only activity is the primary and secondary treatment of municipal wastewater.\n\nLiquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only two chemicals used in sufficient quantity at the facility to be regulated under the RMP program.\n\nUp to seven (7) one ton cylinders of chlorine and seven (7) one ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide are stored at the site. Up to two (2) cylinders of chlorine are used at any one time in the process and two (2) cylinders of sulfur dioxide.\n\nTexarkana Water Utilities is dedicated to the safe and proper handling of chemicals necessary for the production of drinking water and treatment of wastewater for its citizens. Utility management has consistently budgeted and the elected bodies of the two Texarkana's have consistently approved funds to support personnel and citizen safety preventative maintenance training, chemical awareness and handling, emergency response and equipment related to chemicals used at the facility.\n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine considers the release of 2000 lbs of chlorine from a one ton cylinder in ten (10) minutes. The dispersion model ALOHA (Area Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres), which is recognized by EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine. Using digital census block files in conjunction with digital area maps, offsite impacts on population, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed. The estimated residential population within the distance to endpoint is 8,100 and at least one of each of the six major public receptors is found within the distance to endpoint.

Modeling and analysis tools for the sulfur dioxide release were the same as those for the chlorine release including the use of the ALOHA dispersion model. The estimated residential population within the distance to endpoint is 22,000.  At least one of al the listed public receptors are found within the distance to endpoint except prisons, and there are no prisons.  None of the listed environmental receptors are within the distance to endpoint.\n\nSeveral training a procedural methods make a worst case release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide unlikely. The site is staffed twenty-four (24) hous a day with periodic inspections of the chlorination facilities made on each of the three daily shifts. Highly trained personnel and an extensive preventative maintenance program keep all chlorination equipment in like new condition. There are remote alarmed gas detectors for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Safety procedures, including those associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide are standardized throuth Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's). Cylinder repair kits for both chemicals are kept at several locations in the system.\n\nThe American Water Works Association publication Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, was used in the selection of an alternative release scenario for chlorine. Scenario I.D. CLA-3 was chosen, as most closely approximating a possible release at this facility. Site specific data was substituted in the ALOHA model and analyzed. The alternative release scenario considers the release of 317 lbs, over a sixty (60) minute period due to the failure of a transfer hose. The same methods were used in the analysis of the alternative scenario as were used for the worst case. The estimated residential population with"

There are no listed environmental receptors in the distance to endpoint.\n\nFor the same reasons listed for the worst case scenario, even the alternative release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is highly unlikely. The accidental release prevention program is predicated on well informed, well trained employees. The facility makes use of written, video and classroom training from the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, Arkansas Department of Health, Chlorine Institute, the American Water Works Association and the Water Environment Association. Facility management has developed written standard operational procedures for all chemical equipment and chemical handling. These SOP's set up and require extensive preventative maintenance programs that provide frequent checks and keep equipment in like new condition. Gas detection and alarm devices are used to provide early alert to any chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.\n\nThere have been no reportable chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases or accidents for a period exceeding five (5) years largely due to the previously described steps taken by Texarkana Wate Utilities management.\n\nThe Utility is included in the written community emergency response plan and maintains a close working relationship with the local Emergency Management Office.
