      "SummaryText": "BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFXI, INC.\r\n501 INDUSTRIAL BLVD.\r\nTERRELL, TEXAS 75160\r\n\r\nFXI, Inc. owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility on 501 Industrial Boulevard. FXI, Inc. receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  \r\n\r\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA's Risk Management Rule.\r\n\r\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the 501 Industrial Boulevard facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building, the probability of release of toluene diisocyanate vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no inhabited receptors (buildings and people other than the FXI, Inc. facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored or unloaded toluene diisocyanate but undeveloped property beyond the property line to the East and South would be impacted by a worst-case scenario.  \r\n\r\nBecause there are no public or environmental receptors and there have been no significant incidents of release in the last five years, FXI, Inc., 501 Industrial Boulevard facility is classified as a \"Program Level 1\" facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n WORST-CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nDELETED in Accordance with 4/19/2004 Rulemaking\r\n\r\nAt the FXI, Inc. plant in Terrell, Texas, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautio"

      "SummaryText": "ns have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by tank truck, and is stored in five indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks) at our plant is up to 530,000 lb.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\r\n\r\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI."

      "SummaryText": "The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nOur facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI cannot impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA's process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  \r\n \r\n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and management system failures.\r\n \r\n In addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain or control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\r\n \r\nRelease Detection \r\n \r\n* Process alarms (e.g., high level alarms and flow cutoff relays on the TDI storage tanks)\r\n* Continuous operator surveillance (e.g., during TDI tanker unloading and TDI supply to the foam process)\r\n \r\n Release Containment/Control\r\n \r\n* Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\r\n* TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\r\n* Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\r\n* Pressure relief devices on equipment to prevent rupture\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of process equipment\r\n* Vapor displaced from storage tanks during unloading is vented through a carbon filter\r\n* Facility personnel in attendance whenever TDI is being transferred from a bulk deliver \r\n  vessel to storage tanks.\r\n \r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n* Trained emergency respon"

Our program includes procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  HAZWOPER training for responding to and cleaning up small spills (up to ten gallons) will occur.  Larger spills or releases will require outside contractors for clean-up.  Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or equipment/facilities, or if the plan fails in any way under emergency conditions.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\r\n \r\n Planned changes to improve safety\r\n* Evaluation of the storage tank system"
