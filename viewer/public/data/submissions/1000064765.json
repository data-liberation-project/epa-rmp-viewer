      "SummaryText": "Overview\r\nThe purpose of this project is to compile the information and materials necessary to resubmit a current plan for the BASF Malcom Facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASF facility in Malcom, Iowa is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions found in Title 40 part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).   The facility is covered by the rule because it stores Toluene Diisocyanate, (20% Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, 80-100% Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate)  in excess of the regulatory 10,000 pound threshold in the Malcom Warehouse and uses this chemical in processing polyurethane products.   Toluene Diisocyanate, (20% Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, 80-100% Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate) are received in approved DOT drums, (55 gallon drums), and is used in polyurethane production.  The drums are moved from the warehouse to the processing area, Plant 1.  The quantity in Plant 1 will not exceed 10 drums at a time during processing.  The material will be stored in the Malcom warehouse at ambient temperature.   The maximum quantity in the warehouse will not exceed 100 drums or 55100 pounds. \r\n\r\nAccident History:\r\nBASF Malcom has not had any releases from the process that resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, responses or restoration activities within the last 3 years of ownership.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  Worst Case Using PHAST Modeling\r\nAmbient air temperature at 102 deg F, 58% relative humidity, Stability class F, Release inside a building into containment. \r\n\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving Toluene Diisocyanate, (20% Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate, 80-100% Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate). PHAST Modeling  was used to determine the worst-case release scenario using toluene-2, 4-diisocyanate and toluene-2,6-diisocyanate as the mixed isomer. \r\n\r\nAn evaluation was completed which identified the worst case to be the bottom valve on Reactor 15 failed releasing a"
