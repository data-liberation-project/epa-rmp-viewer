      "SummaryText": "   Agrimark is a farmer owned co-op providing service and products to our customers for use in production agriculture. One of these products is anhydrous ammonia which provides a low cost,easy to handle source of nitrogn for corn and wheat production. Our facility has an 18000 gallon storage tank, which is considered full at85% capacity, from which we transfer ammonia to smaller tanks for sale to our customers.\n    Agrimark has not had any injuries or  accidental release of product on record for the past 5 years.\n With our on going maintanence and safety programs and continued safe handling practices our plan is to \nkeep this number at 0.\n    Local fire departments and other emergency response recieve periodic updates on the facility and proper response to an ammonia relesae or injury.\n   Using epa guidelines, a major release of product would be the result of a rupture in the main storage tank\nresulting in a complete dispersal of product in 10 minutes or less. This could affect an area of up to 1.5 mile radius around the release site resulting in the possible evacuation of population down wind from the release site. If an incident occurs the Branch Mgr. to contact the proper emergency response people per our company emergency action plan . Plant personel have also been trained to seek safe haven.\n    A more likely scenario would be a transfer hose would rupture releasing product to air. In most of these cases built in excess flow valves would automaticly shut off the flow of product minimizing the release. \nDue to a smller release the area around the release site afected would only be .3 mile or less.\n   With our current safety record we anticipate no changes in our operation or our training procedures at this time."
