Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility is used for the chemical treatment of wastewater.  Otay Water District's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also to maintain a comprehensive safety and environmental program for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Otay Water District's Systems Operations Manager is responsible for administering the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.  A complete technical assessment of the facility has been conducted. This thorough assessment covers many areas including identifying potential hazards throughout the facility and studying external events including seismic events that might affect the integrity of the chlorine system. Plausible accidents that would result in a release were analyzed to estimate the dispersion and transport from the release location. The results were then examined in a vulnerability analysis to ensure that no significant impact on the public would result from an accidental release from the facility. These studies were performed to identify mitigation measures necessary for the safety of the facility, its employees, and the surrounding environment. These studies include a Process Hazard Analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Seismic Assessment.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility uses up to five one-ton containers of chlorine.  Chlorine gas leaving the one-ton containers passes through a vacuum regulator to the injector.  Still under vacuum from the regulators, it is drawn to injectors and mixed with water where the treatment process occurs.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system is operated under vacuum (negative pressure) conditions.

      "SummaryText": " of each one-ton container is monitored with scales allowing facility operators to plan ahead for ordering more chlorine.  The one-ton containers are positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 inches Hg), which opens the vacuum regulators at the tanks, allowing flow of chlorine.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one-ton container, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping chlorine from exiting the one-ton container.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum will be drawn through the injectors and into solution.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe chlorine gas is pulled from the one-ton containers to the vacuum regulator from the injector. The system is equipped with rotameters to monitor and control the chlorine flow rate. Up to five one-ton containers are in the facility, but only two can be connected to the system at any one time. As the chlorine supply in the tank is exhausted, the vacuum pulls open the regulator on the next available container.  The empty container can then be disconnected and replaced. From the chlorinators, the chlorine gas is injected directly into the wastewater stream.\n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations at the time of construction.  In addition, the facility was designed in accordance with industry standards and with generally accepted engineering practices.  The Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility has established a mechanical integrity program for maintaining and operating the chlorine equipment.  In addition, the facility is in compliance with the following regulations regarding chlorine handling:\n\n\n\n?    California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program;\n\n?    Cal OSHA's Process "

      "SummaryText": "Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n?    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility maintains tight control of the chlorine process through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensor / detector, 2) alarms, and 3) the scrubber.  \n\n\n\nTwo chlorine sensors that trigger an audible and visual alarm are located in the Chlorine Storage Room (1) and the Chlorinator Room (1).  Once a detector senses chlorine at a low concentration of 0.5 ppm inside the room in which the detector is located, an alarm is sent to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and visual alarm is activated outside the room with the chlorine leak.  Once a chlorine sensor reaches a high level, 5.0 ppm, the Scrubber is triggered and pulls the atmosphere of the Chlorine and Chlorinator Rooms into the Scrubber, where Sodium Hydroxide neutralizes the Chlorine gas.  The exhaust fan in the Chlorinator Room is automatically shut off when the Scrubber turns on so that the gas remains in the room to be scrubbed.  In addition, the system is equipped with halogen actuators that are tied to the chlorine leak detectors and will close the valve in the case of a leak.\n\n\n\nFuse plugs on the one ton containers are the main relief system for the chlorine equipment.  Fuse plugs are designed to yield and melt between 158?F and 165?F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature. In addition to the fuse plugs on the one-ton containers, there are remote mounted pressure relief valves connected to the Wallace & Tiernan / US Filter vacuum regulator-check unit piping.  These relief valves vent to atmosphere to a safe location.\n\n \n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe CalARP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:"

On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (19CCR2750.9(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (19CCR2750.9(a)).\"\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study conducted on May 15, 2018, revealed that in the last five years (May 2013 - May 2018), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  This plan is detailed in the Emergency Response Program section of the Risk Management Program document and was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n?    To save lives.\n\n?    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n?    To protect the environment.\n\n?    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility's Assistant Chief of Water Operations is the designated emergency coordinator for the plant.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures and was implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the plant.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Ralph W. Chapman Water Recycling Facility has taken a pro active approach to emergency response and safety. "
