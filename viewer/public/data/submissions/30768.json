      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe Galena Park Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures. In September 2003, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. purchased the facility, which has handled Butadient since 1957 without a harmful release. If an emergency were to occur, it is our written policy to notify the Galena Park LEPC and Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA) and request they responsd to the emergency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Galena Park Terminal is a for hire bulk liquid storage facility, occupying 196 acres with 108 above ground storage tanks and two pressure vessels. The pressure vessels accommodate the handling of 1,3-Butadiene to receive and deliver by pipeline, tankcar, barge and ship. The vessels are refrigerated for product quality reasons. This is the only regulated process governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP. Storage at the facility may be incident to transportation and may not be regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nGERERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe facility is compliant with the thirteen(13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance proceedures. The facility has no Trade Secrets. The storage and distribution system is governed by OSHA's PSM regulation, in addition to the U.S. Coast Guard's 33 CFR Part J 126/127, Waterfront Facilities Handling Liquified Hazardous Gas. The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the tanks and equipment."

      "SummaryText": "FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been no accidental release from the 1,3-Butadiene process at the Galena Park Terminal that has required reporting under the RMP rule. Futhermore the Galena Park Terminal has never had an accident involving 1,3-Butadiene that has resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. The terminal is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), in addition to maintaining and being active in the Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA) and Clean Channel Association. Within the past five years the process has no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP. The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed and reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nReplacement of the flare system is scheduled to be completed August 2004 along with replacing the refrigeration chillers and changing the cooling agent to reduce environmental risk. Perimeter monitors will also be installed during this system upgrade. The upgrade has followed the MOC process."
