As required by the RMP an Off-site Consequence Analysis has been done for the facility to determine what impact the Worse Case, and the more realistic Alternate Case releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years.\n\nTo deal with any possible release of ammonia management maintains an ongoing relationship with two experienced refrigeration contractors, both within 6 miles, in Yakima.  In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away. The facility has an action plan, not a response plan, so it is not expected or intended that employees would attempt to enter the facility until properly trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive.\n\nAll of the refrigeration computer controls have been updated with new computers and software regularly.  Ventilation has been increased in the machine rooms and ammonia detection has been added to several unprotected locations."

      "SummaryText": "Facility was purchased in January of 2023 by New Columbia Fruit Co, LLC.  Management personnel  changes have been made in this resubmission.   Frosty Packing Co, LLC stopped packing procedures at the facility approximately a year prior to sale, and uses the facility for storage of apples only.  \n\nApples are harvested and loaded in regular cold storage rooms and controlled atmosphere rooms over a several week period in the fall.  Apples are removed from storage rooms and are washed, sorted, and packaged for fresh fruit markets, year round.  The packaged apples are stored in refrigerated rooms until shipment. A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system every work day and continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat.  It is present as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor in the system.  There is 17,883 pounds of ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nTo maintain a safe facility operation management has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). All refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system and sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem.  Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures).  All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan and participate in annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\nThe facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant, and has in place both OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA"
