Annual inspections by Iowa Department of Agriculture\nand Land Stewardship (IDALS) are made on facilities and portable nurse tanks. Frequent site inspections are\nmade by management and safety consultants. Equipment inspections, maintenance and employee training\nare conducted prior to every application season.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that caused any death,\ninjuries, or significant damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. Even though this site has had\nno releases, it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and\nprocedures for response to a leak.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38. The\nfacility has also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\ninformation as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), and has coordinated with local emergency responders.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\nrecommendations for implantation at this time."
