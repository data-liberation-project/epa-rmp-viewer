The RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Regulations for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSeaboard Farms of Elberton, Inc., recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has a Plant Safety Program in place.  The objective of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Jim Barker, Plant Engineer, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, inju"

These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSeaboard Farms of Elberton, Inc., operates a poultry processing facility in Elberton Ga. The facility operates ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7662-41-7) contained in the system is above the EPA threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and they are regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the systems are subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n C. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the refrigeration system at the facility involves the release of 30,655 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the -55 degree recirculator vessel pump header.  This is conservative assumption as the liquid level within the unit is normally less than this amount.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance is calculated using RMP Comp, a air modeling method allowable under the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario related to the refrigeration system is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 The Worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical'\n7 The -55 degree recirculator vessel is located in an area with minimal traffic (e.g., forklifts);\n7 Industry standards have been followed for the manufactu"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance is calculated using RMP Comp, a air modeling method allowable under the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the refrigeration system is unlikely for the following reasons'\n\n7 Industry standards have been followed for the manufacture and quality control of these units;\n7 Ammonia is not corrosive to the equipment in this service;\n7 Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n7 The facility has preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the system;\n7 The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n7 The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing isolation valves and liquid lines.\n \nD.
