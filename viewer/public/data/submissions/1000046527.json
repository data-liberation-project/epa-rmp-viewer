Policies and procedures are in-place to assist the staff with compliance with applicable hazardous materials rules and regulations. The Process Safety Management (PSM) Team at the facility is responsible to ensure appropriate procedures and safety measures are in-place to protect our employees and the surrounding community. The PSM Team is comprised of the Distribution Center Director and Maintenance Supervisor with assistance from the Senior Director Facility Services Engineer, Corporate Environmental Manager and from the outside refrigeration contractor.\n\n\n\n    The facility is located in an agricultural area immediately south of the City of Westville. The facility consists of a warehouse house/distribution center and a truck shop. The main warehousing facility is approximately 696,000 square feet and the property is approximately 153 acres in .  The area around the facility is rural and agricultural in nature. There is an Indiana correctional facility located to the northwest of the facility. The terrain is mostly flat and is characterized by paved areas of asphalt and concrete around the facility and agricultural farm fields on all four sides of the site. There are no navigable waterways in the immediate vicinity of the facility (within a mile). \n\n    \n\n    Nash Finch Westville receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to Nash Finch and independent grocery stores in the Westville area, northern and central Indiana as well as surrounding states. Grocery products include dry goods, frozen products as well as meat and other perishable items. The facility has a truck shop and fuel island that services and maintains the facility tractor trailers and provides fuel for their operational needs.

Personnel at the facility include a distribution center director plus administrative staff, warehouse staff and truck drivers. Headcount at the facility is approximately 185 associates.\n\n\n\nPart of the facility is a cold storage warehouse for the storage of frozen and perishable food products. The cooling for this part of the facility is provided by an ammonia refrigeration system containing approximately 22,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. In this system, ammonia is the heat transfer medium that is compressed, cooled through the use of evaporative condensers and distributed to cooling evaporators throughout the refrigerated parts of the facility to maintain appropriate temperatures for the products stored in each area.\n\n\n\nBecause of the use of hazardous materials on-site, the facility is regulated by federal and state hazardous material rules and regulations. The ammonia, diesel fuel and sulfuric acid (used in powered industrial truck batteries) are regulated under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) regulations. The above ground use of petroleum products is regulated under Oil Pollution Prevention requirements (40 CFR Part 112) and as a result, the facility has a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions under the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\nFrom an occupational safety and health perspective the facility is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management standard covering the management and use of the anhydrous ammonia on-site and is required to have an emergency response plan. Other OSHA rules such as lockout tagout, fall protection, confined space; powered industrial trucks, etc. also apply to the facility. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the process presenting the most risk to our employees and the surrounding com"

Safe guards in the form of computer control systems employing sensors and interlocks to shutdown the system in the event of an equipment malfunction or release of ammonia are built into the system. Alarm sensors are placed within the ammonia engine room (processing center) and throughout the facility to alert plant staff of any ammonia releases within the facility. Detailed emergency plans and procedures are in-place to warn our employees and the surrounding community in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nAs of the date of this RMP Plan update, there have been no significant ammonia releases from the facility since Nash Finch acquired the operation in 2005. Incident investigation procedures are in-place to ensure any future release is thoroughly investigated to determine the A?root causeA? of the incident and to ensure appropriate corrective action is implemented quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a detailed emergency response program to handle fire, ammonia releases or natural disasters. All employees receive training during new hire orientation sessions to ensure they understand the facility emergency response procedures. Attachments to Section 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan provide detailed coverage of potential ammonia release scenarios and the appropriate actions in response to those scenarios. In the event of an ammonia release, the employees are provided information over the facility public address system as to the nature of the release and instructions where they should assemble. Given the safety hazards of ammonia, the safest place maybe within the facility; if evacuation is necessary, the employees are given directions to the appropriate outdoor assembly point based on the direction of the wind. Evacuation drills are periodically held to ensure the employees are familiar with the emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nAll rescues and emergency response activities are handled by the Westville Fire Department.
