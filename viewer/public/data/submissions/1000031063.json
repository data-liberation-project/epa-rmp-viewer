      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nPlainview BioEnergy, LLC (PBE)\r\n\r\nThis RMP resubmission is being prepared and submitted to update the RMP based on some administrative changes at the facility and to provide EPA with updated information based on the most recent Process Hazard Analysis completed at the facility. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nPBE has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place. PBE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the Plans listed above and undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  PBE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nPBE is located in Plainview, Hale County, Texas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture, natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  \r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\nWorst Case Scenarios:\r\nAnhydrous ammonia - Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in a 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The worst case scenario used is a r"

A determination spreadsheet is included as part of the RMP documentation file at the facility detailing the conversaion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also included in the documentation file.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to erect a chain link fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes, but the typical chain link fence would not prevent migration of an ammonia release.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6.  No environmental receptors would be affected by a worst case release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant) - The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature 200 proof ethanol prior to shipment off-site.  Denaturant is stored in a 188,000 gallon aboveground steel tank within the tank farm.  The tank farm is located within a lined berm with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation.  The worst case scenario used is the release  of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 1,052,800 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, only 357,952 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112(r).  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are included in PBE's documentation file.  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\r\n\r\nAlternate Scenarios:\r\nAnhydrous ammonia - The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia p"

The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are included in PBE's documentation file.  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture - The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.  The endpoint used was an over-pressurization of 1 psi, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manal overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to a lined containment pond.  For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place at PBE would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine with alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are included in PBE's documentation file.  Of the entire tanker contents, equalling 42,000 pounds of flammable mixture, only 14,280 pounds were used in the RMP Comp model run due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under Section 112(r).  Public receptor information was obtained using Landview 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.    \r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been c"
