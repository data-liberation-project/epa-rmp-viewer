      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nRegulated Substance and Stationary Source\n\nThe Southeastern Mills, Inc. facility in Rome, GA is in the business of milling wheat into various flours to be used in baking food products.  Wheat, by its nature, can carry a variety of bacteria and spores on its surface.  This flora can produce undesirable or harmful qualities in finished products.  Controlled introduction of chlorine gas into the flour during milling reduces the flora to acceptable levels.  Further, chlorine produces reactions in the raw flour which can be advantageous in the baking process.\n\nPressurized chlorine is stored as liquid in one ton cylinders at the mill. Chlorine is introduced into the milling system via multiple tank connections to a common manifold sized to the demand rate required by the mill.  Chlorine is drawn through a Gas Pressure Reducing Valve and a Vacuum Regulator \u00bf Pressure Check unit, and enters the chlorinators under vacuum rather than under pressure.  This greatly reduces the probability of a leak of chlorine from the chlorine delivery piping.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this site is 16,000 pounds, which exceeds the EPA\u00bfs threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Southeastern Mills is therefore subject to RMP requirements under CAA 112 (r).\n\n\nPrevention of Chlorine Release\n\nThe process is designed and maintained in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety information that is incorporated within the Process Safety Management (PSM) document on file at the facility.  It is Southeastern Mills' policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we operate and maintain the chlorine storage and dispensing system.  We have retained American Ingredients Company, a nationally recognized expert firm, to perform all periodic and preventive maintenance, and to provide frequent and thorough training to our personnel.

Southeastern Mills works with emergency responders of the Rome-Floyd Emergency Management Agency, who are trained and equipped to respond to a release.  Their phone number is (706) 236-4543.  Further, appropriate Southeastern Mills personnel are trained and informed to contact the National Response Center at (800) 424-8802."
