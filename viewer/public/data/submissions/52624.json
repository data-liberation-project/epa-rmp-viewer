The system is checked on a regular basis to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\n\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility\u00bfs professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak. \n\nThe management at Tropicana is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at the Tropicana facility is scheduled to be completed in late September 2008.  The facility is located at 20405 Business Parkway in Walnut, California.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 11,000 pounds of ammonia for the cold storage of fruit juice and fruit juice beverages.  The majority of the system is located in and around the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condenser is mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the High Pressure/ Thermosyphon Receiver (V2) to the +20\u00b0F Recirculator (V1). In addition, the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receiver is also used as a reservoir of liquid ammonia for thermosyphon oil c"

The resulting `wet suction\u00bf (liquid/vapor mix) from the +35\u00b0F Cooler Evaporators is returned to the +20\u00b0F Recirculator. \n\nThe Compressors draw vapor from the +20\u00b0F Recirculator and increase the pressure of the ammonia vapor through the discharge port of the machine. The Compressors then send high pressure discharge vapor to the Condenser.  High pressure discharge from the Compressors is routed to the +35\u00b0F Cooler Evaporators, which utilize hot gas for coil defrost.\n\nAt the Condenser, water (pumps) and air (fans) are used to condense the compressor discharge into high pressure liquid, which then drains to the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again. \n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensibles, i.e. air, from the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Tropicana ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration contractor to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include two water diffusion tanks, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (Condenser and High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receiver)."

System startup is scheduled for late September 2008.  Thus, there is no accident history to report.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Tropicana facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP/CalARP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the Tropicana facility will evacuate all employees and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).

The Tropicana safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
