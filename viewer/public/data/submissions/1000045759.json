      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the Battle Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant\r\n\r\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n     We at the Battle Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Battle Creek Fire Department (HAZMAT) which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The HAZMAT team also coordinates their response with the Calhoun County LEPC and state, local, and federal emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n     Our facility's primary activities encompass municipal wastewater (sewage) treatment.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in several uses.  Chlorine is used for disinfection and process control.  \r\n\r\n     Chlorine is used in one building within the facility, the Operations Building.  Chlorine is present within two rooms in the building.  All Chlorine equipment is interconnected by a piping system.  Together these two process areas and the connecting piping comprise our one and only Chlorination process. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 42000.00 lb. at one location, in 2000 lb. containers.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario (including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario)\r\n     To evaluate the worst case scenario,"

For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release from the Chlorination process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a liquid form over 10 minutes.  No mitigation is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\r\n\r\n     The alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Chlorination process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 133.3 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under Class D atmospheric stability, with 3.0 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.10 miles, which results in no off-site release.\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n     Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Chlorination process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit (Michigan ID 83-07). The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety informatio"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  Company employees actively serve on the Process Safety Management team.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n   On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Specification require that contractors adhere to all federal, state, and local safety regulations and company policies.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes, and of coordinating safety issues with contractors and Wastewater Treatment Plant employees.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractor safety performance is reviewed at the time of contract acceptance, periodically thereafter at contract renewal, and at all construction progress meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year Accident History\r\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent policies and procedures, there have been no reportable accidental releases in the last five years\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\r\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan covers all aspects of emergency response including isolation, evacuations, and notification of a qualified and staffed local emergency response provider.

Our plans are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n     The Battle Creek Fire Department (HAZMAT) emergency response team is the responding agency for uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances at our facility.  Their emergency response program includes extensive training and procedures for incident command, controlling releases, mitigation, evacuation, first-aid and medical care, and wide scale reponse notification and coordination.  The Calhoun County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which has been notified of our highly hazardous materials as required, and with which our emergency plan provisions have been coordinated.  \r\n\r\n7.  Changes to Improve Safety\r\n     Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Additional mitigation devices, reduction of inventories, and revised procedures, additional monitoring devices, process area entry monitoring, and process area security are some of the steps which have already been taken to improve Chlorine safety at our facility.  Conversion from a pressure/vacuum system to a safer, vacuum-type system, and installation of automatic shutoff devices occured in 2005.  \r\n\r\n 8.
