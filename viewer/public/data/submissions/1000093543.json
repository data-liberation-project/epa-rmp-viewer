The following\r\ntypes of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel.\r\n2. Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\r\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n4.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of\r\nthe most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major\r\nprocess change or renovation. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have\r\noperating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and\r\nevaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the\r\nteam makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team\r\nbelieves such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nEach PHA will address the following:\r\na) hazards of the process,\r\nb) previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\r\nc) consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\r\nd) engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships,\r\ne) facility siting issues,\r\nf) human factors.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate\r\nmanagement for resolution.

Job plans/written procedures help\r\nensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections\r\nand tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that\r\nequipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

This commitment is demonstrated by the\r\nresources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the\r\ndesign, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement\r\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release\r\ndoes occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Other safety\r\nmeasures such as fire suppression, ambulatory, or evacuation of the community is coordinated and\r\nhandled through local emergency response personnel in the community.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Houston Railyard receive propane, iso-butane, n-butane and natural gasoline from the Houston Gas Plant and loads the product directly into railcars for transporation. Several support vessels exist to aid in handling and loading of these NGLs.  A ethyl mercaptan tank is also located at the site to odorize propane cars when requested by customers. \r\n\r\nRegulated substances that are currently stored or will be stored through the time of predictive filing\r\nin this RMP include propane, ethyl mercaptan and flammable mixtures.  Iso- and n-butane are transported through pipeline and directly into railcars but are not stored as a purity product at the Railyard.\r\n\r\nFor additional detail of the various processes at the Houston Railyard see the plant operations\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention in place for the process at the facility.\r\nBecause the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's\r\n(EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and\r\nHealth Administration's (OSHA's)"
