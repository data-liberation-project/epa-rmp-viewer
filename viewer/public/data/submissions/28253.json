This commitment is demonstrated by Thrifty Ice Cream comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is Thrifty Ice Cream policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if a release should occur, Thrifty Ice Cream trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of a release.  We are also coordinated with the County of Los Angeles Fire Department, Health Hazardous Materials Division serving the City of El Monte Area, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThrift Ice Cream's primary activities encompass production of ice cream and frozen desert products.  We have one regulated substance present at Thrifty Ice Cream's facility; ammonia (anhydrous) used as a refrigerant.  The maximum inventory ammonia (anhydrous) is 25,000 pounds and is contained within a single refrigeration system serving the various production and process areas within the Thrifty Ice Cream, El Monte Ice Cream Plant.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigating measures.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for Thrifty Ice Cream's facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a"

      "SummaryText": "class involves a hypothetical catastrophic release from the ammonia refrigeration system. In this scenario 18,500 pounds of ammonia are released from the liquid ammonia receiver at the Ice Cream Plant, within a secure area of the facility.  The liquid ammonia released inside an enclosed building is assumed to have formed a pool.  The pool is estimated to have evaporated over a 10-minute period (1,850 pounds/minute) and passive mitigating measures as prescribed and recommended by the EPA have been assumed.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a hypothetical release from ammonia piping at a raw materials storage silo.  The scenario involves the release of 100 pounds of ammonia from a failed pipe fitting at one of the storage silos, which is located outdoors within a secure area.  The release is assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems, monitoring and manual shutdown.  System operational and emergency response personnel estimate the release to occur over a 10-minute period (10 pounds per minute) prior to the implementation of control measures.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Thrifty Ice Cream facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release and prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Uniform Building Code.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Thrift Ice Cream stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThrifty Ice Cream maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThrifty Ice Cream conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with Thrifty Ice Cream processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval or with major system component changes or additions.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on December 1, 2001.  No significant changes or additions to the Ammonia Refrigeration System have taken place since the above referenced analyses.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Thrifty Ice Cream covered processes, Thrifty Ice Cream maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThrifty Ice Cream has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as required or needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThrifty Ice Cream performs and documents maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
