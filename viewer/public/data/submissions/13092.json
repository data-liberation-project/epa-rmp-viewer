Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis City of Hanford Wastewater Treatment Facility, located at 10555 Houston Avenue, Hanford, California, handles chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Hanford uses chlorine gas to disinfect wastewater in three different areas of the Wastewater Treatment Facility.  These three areas are:\n\n7 the head works before the bar screen\n7 before the retention ponds after, the secondary treatment process.  \n7 the re-circulation structure, which currently is not in use\n\nChlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP.  Off-loading of the one-ton container from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a two-ton hoist. All the one-ton containers are placed in the chlorine building on a metal storage rack. Two of the containers that are on-line are placed on the load-cell scale.  Two other containers are placed on stand-by.  The WWTP facility has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 8 one-ton containers for a total of 16,000 pounds; 7 of the containers are stored in the building and one is stored outside, near the chlorine building.  \n\nDelivery of the one-ton containers is during normal wo"

The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers and loading of the empty one-ton containers. The chlorine building is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The chlorine building is locked after normal working hours.  No unauthorized personnel are allowed entry into the building.  The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.       \n\nThis treatment facility operates twenty-four hour per day, seven days per week.  The amount of chlorine used in the treatment process is dependent upon many factors.\n\nThe average feed rate for the spring of 1998 was 500 pounds per day.  The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the chlorine gas from the one-ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the rotometer at the chlorinator unit. The gas is injected into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine/ water solution and is feed where it is needed in the treatment process.  The chlorine building has inlet and outlet exhaust fans for fresh air entry, chlorine leak detectors, and alarm systems. The vacuum regulators are vented to the outside. \n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine container is the largest vessel in the chlorine system located at The Wastewater Treatment Facility.   The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 1.3 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond th"

Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for chlorine for the one ton container located at the Wastewater Treatment Facility assumes a release from a valve packing, resulting in an estimated release of no more than 2 pounds per hour.  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 2 pounds for the regulated substance. The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario is 0.1 mile.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine systems and the training provided to the chlorine operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Respo"

      "SummaryText": "nse Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Hanford Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The Kings County Division of Environmental Health Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances."
