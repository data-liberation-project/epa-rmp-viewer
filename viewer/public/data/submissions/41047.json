The facility assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and also whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operations of the process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\u00b7Incident investigation\nThe Old Town Mill investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented. The facility trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An incident investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigations are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n \n\u00b7Employee participation\nThe Old Town Mill has developed a written employee participation program for the covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of employees are addressed.

A supervisor from the area where the work is taking place is required to fill out the Hot Work Permit form prior to the work beginning.\n\n\u00b7Contractors\nThe Old Town Mill has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner. The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. The facility explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures. The contractor supervisors are required to train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site. The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nThe Fort James Operating Company concurs with US EPA\u00bfs assessment that, \u00bfPrevention of accidental releases requires a holistic approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices\u00bf.  Therefore, Old Town Mill\u00bfs prevention program is designed to provide for ongoing management of highly hazardous substances.  It is not a list of \u00bfonce and done\u00bf actions.  Rather it provides a means for assuring safe operations throughout the life of the facility.  To this end, the Old Town Mill utilizes modern computer managing techniques in coordination with plant-wide awareness to ensure continued fulfillment of prevention requirements.\n\n\n \nES.4 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY AT THE OLD TOWN MILL\n\nThe Fort James Operating Company has had one event over the past five years that qualified as an RMP repo"

The operators were experiencing difficulty in starting up the process and overflowed a process vessel which contained stock. The stock overflowed to near where the injured employee was working. Chlorine Dioxide evolved from the stock exposing the employee. The employee has a known respiratory condition which made them more sensitive to the chemical. The employee showed no serious symptoms of exposure but later received prescription medications for respiratory discomfort.\n\n\nES.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AT THE OLD TOWN MILL\n\nThe Fort James Operating Company Old Town Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance.  The Old Town Mill emergency response program utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS.  This is an \u00bfall risk\u00bf system developed for on-scene management of any emergency event.  The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact of personnel changes upon the emergency plan.  Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes or facilities.  In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC.

To that end, the Fort James Operating Company Old Town Mill has replaced the chlorine bleaching system with an elemental chlorine-free system. The new system consists of chlorine dioxide oxidizing bleaching system. This change has resulted in the complete phase out of elemental chlorine from the Old Town Mill. The use of chlorine dioxide greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the bleaching process. The elimination of elemental chlorine in the bleaching process has reduced the worst-case distance to toxic endpoint.  Fort James believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment."

The Fort James Old Town Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nThe Fort James Operating Company has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Fort James Old Town Mill plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at Old Town have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemical is chlorine dioxide.\n\nThe Fort James Old Town Mill has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The management system is summarized below.\n\nRisk Management Plan \u00bf M"

      "SummaryText": "dioxide, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.  Emissions from the chlorine dioxide stages of the bleach plant are collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber.  Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and stored as a dilute aqueous solution.  The emissions from this process are also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES AND PROCESSES\n\nThe Old Town Mill operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance: chlorine dioxide generation and storage.  This process stores chlorine dioxide solution in a 190,000 gallon storage tank at typical concentrations of 9.5 grams per liter. The maximum concentration (before interlocks) is 11.5 grams per liter. A full storage tank at this concentration is equivalent to 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide. \n\nSince the resulting toxic endpoint distance predicted for the worst-case release of chlorine dioxide potentially encompasses public receptors, and the bleaching process is subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this process is subject to Program 3 requirements. \n\n \n\nES.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS AT THE OLD TOWN MILL\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Old Town Mill of Fort James Operating Company has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA\u00bfs 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA\u00bfs 40 CFR Part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program.  The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of the twelve elements listed below.\n\n\u00b7Process safety information\nThe Old Town Mill maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes.
