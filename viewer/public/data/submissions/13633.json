This facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Milwaukee Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.  This facility is a steel foundry.  We produce steel castings primarily for the mining industry.  We use propane to power our forklifts and it is also used as a backup heating source for our buildings.  The tank is a 30,000 gallon propane tank with associated piping, valves, burners, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS.  Our worst case scenario is the failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2 inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10 minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThe propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state law.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  We have not had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuation, or shelterings in place in the last five years.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Milwaukee Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  We plan to conduct refresher training in LP Gas tank filling.  We plan to have an outside company conduct"
