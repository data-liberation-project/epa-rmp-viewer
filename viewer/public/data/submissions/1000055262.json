(Hexion) is committed to the continuous improvement of chemical safety management.  Hexion maintains Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities.  As part of this commitment, Hexion invests resources in various areas of accident prevention, such as:\n\n?    Safety in process design;\n\n?    Safe operating policies and procedures;\n\n?    A comprehensive mechanical integrity program;\n\n?    Management of process changes;\n\n?    Training;\n\n?    Incident investigation and auditing; and\n\n?    Emergency response participation.\n\n\n\nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at Hexion, including:\n\n?    A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule;\n\n?    A summary of potential release scenarios and potential off-site consequences;\n\n?    An overview of the Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases;\n\n?    A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n?    An overview of the emergency response program; and\n\n?    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nHexion operates three (3) units with regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered under the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the RMP regulation.  These three units, the C-unit, the Resins Unit, and the Shipping Unit, store or process RMP toxic and flammable substances as follows:\n\n\n\n1.  C-Unit\n\nThis unit produces and/or stores intermediate feedstocks used in the production of epoxy resins and calcium chloride.  RMP regulated substances stored or processed in this unit include 37% Hydrochloric Acid, Chlorine, Epichlorohydrin, Propylene, and Butane.\n\n\n\n2.  Resins Unit\n\nThis unit produces fin"

Part of the Accident Prevention Program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  This is accomplished through Process Hazard Analyses and periodic review of policies and procedures.  Additionally, the site has various safety features to detect, contain and control, and mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\n\n\n\n1. Release detection\n\n?    Process alarms\n\n?    Operator surveillance\n\n?    Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \n\n?    Perimeter chlorine detection system\n\n\n\n2. Release containment and control\n\n?    Relief systems designed to prevent equipment overpressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare)\n\n?    Dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n?    Redundant equipment (i.e. back-up firewater pump)\n\n?    Automatic control valves to allow rapid isolation of the process\n\n?    Chlorine emergency containment system\n\n\n\n3.

This coordination includes periodic committee meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, community members, and industry representatives.  Shell and Hexion maintain trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents.  Hexion also maintains a 24 hr. communications capability with St. Charles Parish DEP officials, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire departments, Sheriff's department, State Police, etc.).  In addition to established lines of communication with area emergency response organizations, Hexion is also a member of the St. Charles Parish Industrial Mutual Aid Association.  Periodic emergency drills are held with the St. Charles Parish DEP, Mutual Aid Organization members, and local emergency response organizations.  Refresher training is also provided to local emergency response organizations on the hazards of regulated substances at the site.\n\nThe St. Charles Parish DEP is responsible for maintaining written plans for the preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery of any natural or technological disaster that may occur in St. Charles Parish. This responsibility includes coordination with neighboring Parishes who may be affected by an emergency incident within St. Charles Parish.  The DEP is also responsible for coordinating the plans and operations of various emergency response agencies in St. Charles Parish such as fire, police, emergency medical services, public works, volunteers and other groups that respond to emergencies. \n\n\n\nHexion (through Shell) maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment.

In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Resins processes.  The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change.  All the above actions of the emergency response program are undertaken by Hexion through a service agreement with Shell. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n\n\n1. The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\n2. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n\n\n3. The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n\n\n4. Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n\n\n5.
