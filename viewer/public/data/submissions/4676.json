The\n     Safety Director is responsible for the overall\n     development, administration and supervision of\n     activities required by OSHA, EPA, DOT and other federal\n     and state agencies, to safeguard all BGMU employees.\n     There are Safety Officers at the Treatment Plants, with\n     their primary job consisting in Plant Operations and\n     then secondary as Safety, in which they coordinate all\n     inspections, safety equipment and employee assistance\n     in safety at the Treatment Plants.\nPROGRAM ADMINISTRATION\n     Bowling Green Municipal Utilities on April 27, 1989\n     hired a full-time Safety Director so that BGMU could\n     develop and implement a written Safety Program.  With\n     the hiring be completed, the major obstacle was\n     achieving compliance in the OSHA, EPA and DOT\n     regulations so that BGMU and all the employees would\n     have a safe and healthful work environment.  To this\n     date the Safety Department now handles all of the\n     compliance programs in the Electric, Water and Sewer\n     Divisions, with the only exception being environmental\n     issues that directly involve the Industrial Wastewater\n     Pretreatment Program, which the Industrial Pretreatment\n     Director handles.  Bowling Green Municipal Utilities\n     initialized a Safety Committee on October 26, 1994\n     starting with a member from each work area for a total\n     of 10 members.  This committee makes its\n     recommendations for health and safety issues that\n     include investigations of injuries/accidents.  Bowling\n     Green Municipal Utilities insures that each employee\n     upon being hired is issued an employee handbook, in\n     which this book explains many benefits, employment\n     rules, insurance plans, work hours and policies.\nTRAINING\n     Bowling Green Municipal Utilities"

Such a leak\n               will get worse until the condition is\n               corrected.  Until that time the down-wind\n               hazards will continue.\n\n          B.   Slug Release -- a slug release will occur if\n               a vessel incurs a large puncture or ruptures.\n               Large quantities of chlorine will be\n               discharged in a short time.  In the case of a\n               puncture in the upper (vapor) portion of the\n               vessel about one-fourth of the liquid\n               (depending on the liquid temperature) will\n               rapidly evaporate or \"flash off\". This will\n               cool the remaining liquid to the atmospheric\n               boiling point.  The evaporation rate of the\n               remaining liquid primarily depends on the\n               heat input from the atmosphere.  In the case\n               of a puncture in the liquid phase, liquid\n               will be expelled through the hole until the\n               liquid drops to the lip of the opening.

The evaporation rate of the\n               spilled liquid depends on heat input from the\n               ground and from the sun.  Reducing the\n               surface area of the spill will reduce the\n               evaporation rate.

Such burns will become apparent most quickly in\nthe sensitive areas of             the body such as around\nthe genitals, between the buttocks or under the arms.\nProtective clothing should reduce exposure of all body\nsurfaces to chlorine gas                so as to minimize\nthe physiological damage that may occur.  It must be\nrecognized that a given concentration of chlorine gas will\nbe more harmful in a               hot, moist climate than\nin a cold, dry climate.  Similarly, it will be more harmful\nto a person who is working hard in such an atmosphere than\nit will to a person                who is quickly passing\nthrough an area.\n\n     Liquid Chlorine\n\n          Liquid chlorine is a very cold liquid, boiling at\n          -34F (-29C).  Contact with such a liquid will\n          result in frostbite.  The only protection is to\n          remain out of the range of the liquid.  Protective\n          clothing, which will prevent penetration of\n          chlorine gas, is unlikely to be insulated on the\n          inside and will be ineffective against frostbite.\n\n     After Exposure to Chlorine\n\n          Personnel should shower immediately after being\nexposed to high concentrations               of chlorine so\nas to wash away the harmful substances and minimize\nphysiological damage.\n\n        PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ATTENTION IS MANDATORY.\n\n     General\n\n          A.  Protective clothing is for the protection of\nrescue, emergency repair crews                     and it\nmay be required for the protection of personnel making\nroutine or                     scheduled repairs.  It should\nnever be required under routine operating\nconditions.  When an emergency occurs, the personnel\ndirectly involved                   must escape from the\nhazardous area quickly with special protective\nclothing.  SCBA's are always in use.\n\n          B.  Once a chlorine leak has occurred a decision\nwill be made with the Bowling                     Green Fire\nDepartment to decide which type of protect"
