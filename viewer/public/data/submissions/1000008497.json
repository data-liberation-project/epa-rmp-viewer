              "Description": "The facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA guidelines. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.  A detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes is maintained.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nComprehensive studies are conducted to ensure that hazards associated with site processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The methodologies used to complete these studies are HAZOP and What-If analysis, whichever is most appropriate for the situation.  A team performs the process hazard analysis (PHA) and includes expertise in engineering and operations.  All PHA's are updated and revalidated by a competent team (as described above) and all action items/recommendations are tracked for resolution in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are maintained for the purpose of safely operating the covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation, including normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  A system exists so that all the required operating procedures stay current and accurate.  The procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nA comprehensive operations training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent and familiar with the operating procedures associated with the processes.  A system is in place so that all required training is conducted in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA written policy exists to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modificalions of established processes are conducted.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nAudits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being complied with.  These audits occur at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulaled substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a mininum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCelanese believes that accident prevention through implementation of PSM/RMP is a team effort.  Company employees routinely participate in process hazard analyses, operating procedures updates, department inspections, incident investigations, safe work permit procedure updates, emergency drills, etc.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, contractors are hired to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selection of a contractor, an evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor company is completed.  Contractors are trained on the known potential hazards related to the contractors' work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.    \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nVinyl Acetate Storage Tank\n\nThe vinyl acetate storage tank has been constructed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Mechanical integrity inspections of the tanks is conducted.  The tank has secondary containment and hydrant-mounted firewater monitors to minimize tha impact in case of a release. \n\nEthylene Storage Tank\n\nThe ethylene storage system was built in 1997 as per applicable engineering standard.  Access to the tank is restricted.  It was pressure-tested prior to placing in service and mechanical integrity inspections are conducted.  All electrical accessories, such as pumps, instruments, and wiring, are explosion-proof and constructed per applicable electrical codes.  It has a state-of-the-art redundant pressure relief system and is monitored 24 hours per day by a remotely monitored video camera.  Product unloading is generally conducted during daylight housr.  Excess emissicn of ethylene are controlled in a vent flare system. ",

              "Description": "The facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA guidelines. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.  A detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes is maintained.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nComprehensive studies are conducted to ensure that hazards associated with site processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The methodologies used to complete these studies are HAZOP and What-If analysis, whichever is most appropriate for the situation.  A team performs the process hazard analysis (PHA) and includes expertise in engineering and operations.  All PHA's are updated and revalidated by a competent team (as described above) and all action items/recommendations are tracked for resolution in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are maintained for the purpose of safely operating the covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation, including normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  A system exists so that all the required operating procedures stay current and accurate.  The procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nA comprehensive operations training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent and familiar with the operating procedures associated with the processes.  A system is in place so that all required training is conducted in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA written policy exists to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modificalions of established processes are conducted.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nAudits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being complied with.  These audits occur at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulaled substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a mininum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nCelanese believes that accident prevention through implementation of PSM/RMP is a team effort.  Company employees routinely participate in process hazard analyses, operating procedures updates, department inspections, incident investigations, safe work permit procedure updates, emergency drills, etc.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, contractors are hired to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selection of a contractor, an evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor company is completed.  Contractors are trained on the known potential hazards related to the contractors' work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.    \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nVinyl Acetate Storage Tank\n\nThe vinyl acetate storage tank has been constructed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Mechanical integrity inspections of the tanks is conducted.  The tank has secondary containment and hydrant-mounted firewater monitors to minimize tha impact in case of a release. ",
