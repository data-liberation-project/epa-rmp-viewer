      "SummaryText": "Oxnard Berry Cooler (OBC) is a facility located in Oxnard, CA in a commercial/ industrial area of the city.  The Facility was built in the early 1980?s.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables and fruit (strawberries).  The refrigerant in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July.  The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative.  Annual maintenance is performed on the equipment during August and September.\n\nOBC is supported by Western Precooling Systems (WPS), for maintenance and service of the refrigeration equipment.  WPS has offices and staff on site at WPS?s location.  WPS employs mechanical staff that has been trained for CFR 1910.120(q) emergency response, as well as technical training for the tasks they perform as it relates to the refrigeration equipment.  One of the avenues for training that WPS uses is through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  WPS sponsors its technicians in that trade association and has personnel who have challenged and successfully passed the RETA Plant Operators Certification Examination.  Other training is through offsite seminars and on-the-job skill development.  Regularly scheduled safety meetings help keep the message of safe operating and safe work behaviors in the foreground of the employee?s thinking.\n\nWPS performs plant inspections as an ongoing process at the facility.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined the need is expressed at the weekly work load meeting conducted by WPS?s general manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided at the workload meeting and assigned with a due date.  "

      "SummaryText": "Minutes are maintained of the workload meetings.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion OBC and WPS have reduced the equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\nIn 1996 and 1997 modifications were made to the piping system that gave more support to the piping in the event of seismic activity.  At the same time OBC decided to reduce its offsite consequence potential by piping all relief valves to water absorbing tanks.  Relief valve excursions were identified as the most common unwanted release situation and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of a relief situation no longer affected people on-site, nor off-site.  The second most common unwanted release situation involved the process of oil removal from the low-pressure portion of the system.  Special self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  WPS has installed these types of valves at oil drain points.\n\nRelease prevention steps taken at OBC:\n?    OBC has enclosed the facility with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential ?wrong-do-er?s?.\n?    All employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal?s etc.  Training is documented through the ?Personal Qualifications Standard? booklet that is in each employees training record file.\n?    A strong relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire Department.  There have been demonstrations and tours of the system with the first responding engine companies to familiarize the crews with the facility layout and where hazardous areas are located.\n?    The engine room is connected to a computer monitoring system with telephone access.\n?    There is an automatic dialing machine that is connected to temperature, p"

When there is an equipment failure, or when the pressures are rising and approaching the shutdown setting, or if there is a power failure, this auto dialer begins calling out to eight successive phone numbers to summon technicians to solve the problem.\n?    OBC proactively trains its personnel in the benefits of good housekeeping.  There is a staff to maintain the general appearance of the facility on a day to day basis.\n\nThe policy at OBC is to not have accidental releases or emergencies.  This is accomplished by due diligence with the thoughts of ?prevention, preparation, mitigation, response & recovery?.  There have been no reportable releases at OBC in the past five years.  However, there is a need to be prepared to respond to and mitigate a release situation.  The OBC staff is trained to communicate to WPS and the Fire Department and to evacuate (shelter in place or evacuate off site) when there is a release situation or fire.  OBC employees and managers are trained to shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product) when there is an emergency.  By effectively determining all persons are safe, the integrated emergency response with the Oxnard Fire can more swiftly manage the tactical part of the response.\n\nWPS has trained individuals (CFR 1910.120(q) First Responder Technician) who are trained to respond to, size up and mitigate a release situation.  WPS personnel have served as industry liaison at the incident command during response situations and as entry team participants at other facilities in Oxnard and Ventura County over the years (again, the problem was not at WPS).\n\nThe worst case scenario depicts a vessel failure at the central receiver.  Even though the receiver does not operate at the level in the scenario we modeled as though it were 80% full.  The toxic endpoint reaches 1.5 miles from the source.
