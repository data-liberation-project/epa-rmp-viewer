We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting processes available. \n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP). The Rich Products Niles facility will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public and the environmental. Trained on-site responders will access the emergency and decide on a course of action. For emergencies within their training level, they will respond. For any emergency not included in their training, off-site emergency response agencies will be called. \n\nThe Stationary Source. The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility. Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS no. 7664-41-7) is the regulated substance handled at this facility. The refrigeration system has a maximum inventory of 20,000 pounds. This quantity qualifies the refrigeration system as a Program 3 process. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program. We are currently in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule. The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training and inspecting. The refrigeration system was designed according to current codes and specifications, and adheres to good operating practice. The operators and contractors who work in and around the refrigeration equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures. We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration equipment. These programs are described in more detail in the full RMP program. \n\nFive Year Accident History. There have been no reportable accidents in the last five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program. The Rich Products Niles facility has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia fro"
