      "SummaryText": "Frontier Fertilizer stores anhydrous ammonia at this facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is used in a process at this facility that converts ammonia and super-phosphoric acid into liquid polyphosphate fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only chemical stored at this facility that is considered by EPA to be covered by RMP.  The potentially toxic properties of ammonia make it necessary for Frontier Fertilizer to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to on-site workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which ammonia is handled combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, safe handling procedures, and the training of workers.  Frontier Fertilizer's management commitment is to manage risk (i.e., maximize prevention and minimize consequences) and continuously maintain and improve safety and accident prevention.\n\nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 480,590 pounds.\n\nA worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario, including mitigation measures to limit the distance reported for the release, are summarized below.\n\n7 Worst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest storage tank, when filled to 85% capacity, would release 154,200 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released within 10 minutes and become airborne vapor.  The distance to the endpoint is 4.6 miles.  This was estimated using EPA default parameters, which results in an overestimate of the endpoint distance.  For example, the wind speed default is 1.5 meters/second, but the NOAA National Data Center reports 5.5 meters/second for the average wind speed in Lubbock.  Higher wind speed is known to cause greater dispersion (i.e., greater dilution in the atmosphere) of released ammonia, which results in an endpoint much less than 4.6 miles.\n\n7 Alternative Scenario - A flow line from the s"

The contents of the flow lines are released and ammonia is vaporized.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.6 miles.  As noted above, this endpoint was estimated using EPA default parameters, which results in an overestimate of the endpoint distance.  For example, the wind speed default is 3.0 meters/second, but the NOAA National Data Center reports 5.5 meters/second for the average wind speed in Lubbock.  Higher wind speed is known to cause greater dispersion (i.e., greater dilution in the atmosphere) of released ammonia, which results in an endpoint much less than 1.6 miles.  In addition, based on the volume of ammonia in the flow lines and release rate (the release duration would be approximately 0.14 minutes, i.e. 9 seconds), the quantity of ammonia is likely to be insufficient to reach a toxic endpoint at 1.6 miles.\n\nNote that an actual release of ammonia would be likely to disperse downwind, and affect only a portion of the residential population reported in the RMP form.  The residential population within distance to the endpoint is estimated from an actual count of residences.  Assuming 2.4 persons per household, the 140 residences within 1.6 miles of the site have 336 persons.\n\nFrontier Fertilizer's accidental release prevention program is found in the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  This includes the preparation and regular updates of the fourteen PSM elements such as process safety information, hazard analysis, operating procedures, and startup-shutdown procedures.  The emergency action plan is based on the concept that employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia in a manner that could result in exposure to ammonia or otherwise endanger their life or health.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority.  The written plan has been submitted to the lo"
