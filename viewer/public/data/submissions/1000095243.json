To support that commitment, the City of Tulsa has adopted safety policies, programs, and procedures to protect employees, contractors, customers, and the City of Tulsa community that we serve, and to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. As part of this safety culture, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) specifically assesses the safety of the chlorine storage and handling process at the Mohawk Water Treatment Plant. This assessment includes procedures to prevent accidental releases, ensure employee training, and ensure timely and effective system maintenance. The RMP is shared with local emergency management and chlorine suppliers to ensure planning occurs for any required emergency response.\n\n\n\nStationary source and the regulated substances handled: The City of Tulsa owns and operates the Mohawk Water Treatment Plant (Mohawk WTP), the stationary source covered in this RMP. Mohawk WTP utilizes liquid chlorine, a regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, as the primary disinfectant in the drinking water treatment process. Liquid chlorine is stored under pressure in two 25-ton above-ground storage tanks. Controls and procedures ensure that neither tank is filled in excess of 80% of capacity, i.e. 40,000 pounds per tank, for a maximum storage of 80,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe two 25-ton storage tanks are located inside the chemical feed building. The tanks were designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels. Chlorine is fed as a gas from the tanks to the chemical treatment stream using vacuum chlorinators that regulate the quantities called for by the plant operation protocols.

The scrubber system was designed in accordance with the Uniform Fire Code with a capacity sufficient to treat the entire contents of one 25-ton storage tank. The storage tanks and appurtenant valves and piping are maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute standards.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps: The Mohawk WTP operation includes measures to ensure compliance with  40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, and all applicable state and local regulations. The chlorine bulk storage tanks, scrubber system, piping, and associated equipment are designed, manufactured, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable ASME, Chlorine Institute, and Uniform Fire Code Standards. Mohawk WTP has completed a hazard review of the chlorine system and documented the findings. Operations and maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented to ensure proper operation and equipment integrity, and those procedures are updated as needed. All employees responsible for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system have been trained and participate in regularly scheduled refresher training. Training records are maintained.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: Mohawk WTP has had no accidental release during the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program: Mohawk WTP is a non-responding facility. In the event of an emergency involving the chlorine process that is more than an incidental leak, with a threat that an accidental release will affect the safety and health of offsite population,  outside assistance will be requested. The Tulsa Fire Department HAZMAT Team will be summoned through 9-1-1, and the chlorine supplier will be contacted for their emergency expertise and response.
