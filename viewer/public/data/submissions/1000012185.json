      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Brandt Farms Inc. has prepared a unified Risk & Process Safety Management Program.  The program is in compliance with California\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (in California CCR Title 19, Chapter 4.5 Program Level 3 Elements.  At the Federal level, Title 40 CFR Part 68), and California OSHA\u00bfs \u00bfProcess Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials\u00bf standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5189, \u00bfProcess Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials,\u00bf and Federally Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119).  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration systems. \r\n\r\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Brandt Farms Inc. business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.\tDESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\r\nThe Brandt Farms Inc. facility is a commercial packinghouses for deciduous tree fruit \u00bf apricots, nectarines, peaches, plums, and grapes.

One room is designated as \u00bfprecooling\u00bf room, one other is designated cold storage room, Several hallways and the loading dock are also refrigerated.  Computer systems also provide substantial control and alarm capability.  \r\n\r\nHigh pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to a series of a liquid feed solenoid valves.  From there, high pressure liquid is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted either on the roof or in the bunkers.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to main suction accumulators which separate any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge gas from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of float switch activated solenoid valves raise the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.  There are three high pressure receivers; two in the west engine room and one in the east engine room.   \r\n\r\nThe facilities were built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance industry standards.  They were also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction of each. The systems contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors"

In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia systems at this facility are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tAMMONIA RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n3.1\tWorst Case Scenario\r\nAt  Brandt Farms Inc, the worst-case scenario is the failure of our largest high-pressure receiver.  This vessel can contain the entire charge of 1200 lbs. of ammonia.  Following the instructions set forth in EPA\u00bfs \u00bfRisk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68),\" we considered the failure of one vessel.  We did not include any liquid ammonia in pipe work connected to the failed vessel.  \r\n\r\nUsing RMP*Comp we estimate that the ammonia would travel 2.0 miles (urban conditions) before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  The potentially affected area can be found on a site map in Appendix A. \r\n\r\n3.2\tAlternative Case Scenario\r\nOur ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with safety relief valves.  These valves limit the operating pressures of the entire system, and prevent failures due to over pressurization.  Our alternative release scenario is as follows.  A high-pressure safety relief valve lifts and fails to reseat.  The rated release rate for our high-pressure safety relief valve is about 75 lbs./min.  We assume the leak would continue for 10 minutes until the header pipe was switched over to the backup safety relieve valve. Following industry practice, our relief valves are installed in pairs with a switch over valve, and the discharge is piped to a release point that is remote from the valve. Under this scenario 750 l"

Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, BG\u00bfs Refrigeration.\r\n\r\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nOur ammonia refrigeration system was designed and built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction.\r\n\r\n5.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nBrandt Farms Inc, has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\r\n\r\n6.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \u00bfEmergency Action Plans.\u00bf  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u00bf and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \r\n\r\nStrate"

      "SummaryText": "gically, we will respond \u00bfminimally\u00bf to a release.  The first priority will be to evacuate all personel and call for emergency response.  The next priority would be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Tulare County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team.\r\n\r\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \r\n\r\n7.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Brandt Farms Inc. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  The restructuring of our Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Brandt Farms Inc. business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \r\n\r\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \r\n\r\nFor the"
