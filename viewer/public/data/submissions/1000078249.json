Jarden Zinc Products is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to both a comprehensive accidental release prevention program and a comprehensive emergency response program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, emergency response, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In addition, Jarden Zinc Products maintains a strong emergency response program with extensive employee training and interaction with the local fire department responders. \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled. We have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in a single use.  Chlorine is used for wastewater treatment. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 360,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the calculations derived from the RMP*Comp software program supplied by EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Storage. The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lbs of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is >25 miles.\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Ch"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition. One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nJarden Zinc Products maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-if\" Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Jarden Zinc Products maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly rev"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nJarden Zinc Products carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Jarden Zinc Products to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training regarding the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Jarden Zinc Products.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nJarden Zinc Products conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whethe"

These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nJarden Zinc Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nJarden Zinc Products believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule, in particular, information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Jarden Zinc Products has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n5.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly reviewed and inspected. To ensure employees have the necessary skills to respond safely and appropriately to an emergency event, employees are provided extensive training that includes classroom learning, tabletop exercises, and practice drill exercises such as the installation of the Chlorine Institute Kit-C. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Greenville Fire Department is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA new emergency notification/alert system is being installed at our facility in 2019. A few additional minor changes will be made to our RMP/PSM program as a result of an internal review/audit.
