The threshold quantity established in 40 CFR 68.130 by EPA is 10,000 lbs.  Columbia Fruit Packers, Inc - Airport Facility has 17,500 lbs of ammonia in their refrigeration system.  The chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n* Reduce the threat to the community\n\n\n\nColumbia Fruit Packers, Inc - Airport Facility uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  Policies, procedures and training have been prepared and implemented to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* High level of training of personnel\n\n* Preventative maintenance program\n\n* Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n\n* Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\n\n\nColumbia Fruit Packers, Inc - Airport Facility also complies with: \n\n"
