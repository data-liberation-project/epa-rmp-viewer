In addition, 3V has provided to the LEPC and the local fire department information on the facility's hazardous chemical inventory.  On May 22nd 2019 SC DHEC reviewed the RMP rule for Process 1.  3V provided additional information to the audit on July 25th 2019.  \r\n\r\nAll employees are trained to recognize the general facility evacuation alarm tones, to understand evacuation procedures and emergency response procedures specific to their work area.  In addition, employees who may become involved with a hazardous material release are trained on how to recognize hazardous materials and/or hazardous situations for purposes of taking defensive measures (alarm, containment, control, and evacuation).  \r\n\r\nDrill exercises are planned and scheduled for training of emergency response personnel as necessary to keep these personnel current in their training and proficient in procedures and equipment use. \r\n \r\nGeorgetown County is a member of an independent, local, community alert network and 3V Inc. is a participant in that effort.  In the unlikely event a hazardous material release were to occur, potentially affected citizens would be notified by means of telephone communications from a centralized service and instructed on what steps to take to protect themselves."

These guidelines assure that the tanks will not over-pressurize under emergency conditions. Some of the specific methods that we use for accident prevention include the following:\r\n* Inerting - oxygen is purged from tanks, pipes, and process equipment with nitrogen to eliminate the potential for a flammable atmosphere.  Under inert conditions, flammable vapors cannot ignite.\r\n* Grounding - storage and process systems are grounded and tested to prevent static discharges, which are a potential ignition source.\r\n* Venting - storage tanks and process vessels have emergency venting systems to prevent vessel ruptures, explosions, and structural damage in an over-pressure situation.\r\n* Alarms - storage tanks and process vessels have various alarms to warn personnel when an operating parameter (i.e. level, temperature, pressure) has deviated out of its safe range. \r\n* Temperature Control - Acetaldehyde is stored at reduced temperature to reduce its vapor pressure, thereby reducing the likelihood of a significant vapor release from the storage and transfer systems.\r\n\r\nThe five-year accident history:\r\nIn the past five years, there have been no reportable accidents associated with our regulated chemicals or their associated processes.  This is a testament to our ability to safely handle these materials without risk to off-site populations.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program\r\n3V Sigma USA Inc.

Process equipment and storage tanks containing flammable liquids are grounded and inerted with nitrogen and equipped with flame arrestors.  Oxidizers and organic peroxides are segregated from combustible and flammable liquids.  Signs are posted at the entrance to the facility prohibiting smoking, matches or open flames.  Facility personnel inspect process vessels, pumps and piping systems routinely for leaks. Temperatures, pressures and levels are monitored at appropriate intervals on tanks and process equipment. Containment structures exist around tanks and process units containing hazardous materials to contain spills should they occur.  These structures are inspected routinely and deficiencies are addressed as they are discovered.  Storage tanks containing flammable or toxic liquids are provided with nitrogen blankets to remove oxygen, vent controls to avoid over or under pressurization, and safety devices to protect the tank from failure.  Structural integrity of vessels, piping systems and tanks is determined by the presence or absence of visible leaks during visual inspections each shift as well as from scheduled non-destructive thickness testing at recommended intervals.\r\n\r\nThe acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate systems and all associated manufacturing processes are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.

This release scenario took into account one storage tank, TK-104, losing maximum inventory from a weather event, i.e. hurricane, tornado, thunderstorm. EPA's model, RMP*Comp, was used to evaluate the distance to the toxic end point.  The quantity release poundage estimated 1/2 the maximum monthly on-hand inventory based on the previous year's SARA Tier II report. The toxic end point is within the facility boundary.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Flammable Release Scenario For Process 1: [Acetaldehyde]\r\nThe worst case flammable release scenario for acetaldehyde was evaluated.  The scenario is the loss of maximum inventory, based on the previous year's SARA Tier II report, in an external storage tank, TK-507, accompanied by a vapor cloud explosion.  The failure of the entire tank would be caused by a severe weather event, i.e. hurricane, tornado, thunderstorm.   The end point of such an event extends beyond the facility boundary, but does not reach any receptors. The closest house is more than five times the distance from the facility as the worst case end point.  \r\n\r\nAlternative Case Flammable Release Scenario For Process 1: [Acetaldehyde]\r\nThe alternate release scenario for acetaldehyde is a release from the same vessel, TK-507, but assumes that the tank is half full and the failure of the tank is through a 3-inch opening.

Various additives and solid materials are sometimes loaded into the reactors via portals or dump chutes.  The mixture is then reacted by manipulation of temperatures and pressures in the reaction vessel.  The resulting mixture is then transferred to downstream equipment where mechanical operations such as filtering, drying, and packaging are performed.  Any unreacted material is then recovered for reuse or treated and removed.  In general, the storage, transfer, and reaction steps are the most critical in terms of safety.  The majority of our final products are non-hazardous.\r\n\r\n3V stores two raw materials that are covered chemicals under the RMP program. These include acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate. All materials are stored and processed in closed systems with protective alarms and features. Through careful planning and controls, acetaldehyde has been handled safely for over 12 years. The vinyl acetate system has been safely handled for over 28 years.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario For Process 1: [Vinyl acetate]\r\nThe worst case toxic release scenario for vinyl acetate was evaluated.  This scenario involves the simultaneous failure of three storage tanks-TK-104, TK-102, TK-433.  The cause would be from a severe weather event, i.e. hurricane, tornado, thunderstorm.  The scenario is the loss of maximum inventory for all three storage tanks. The quantity release poundage was based on the previous year's SARA Tier II report which documents the maximum monthly on-hand inventory.  The storage tanks for vinyl acetate are located outside in two separate concrete containment structures.
