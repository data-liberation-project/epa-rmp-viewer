      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery has been in operation since 1978.  Since its inception, it has been committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Woodbridge Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery is located at 5950 East Woodbridge Road in Acampo, California.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's three independent refrigeration systems (Plants 1, 2, and 3).  The systems provide cooling for the storage of wine product.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia for each process and a description of how each process operates are as follows.       \n\n\n\nPlant 1\n\nInventory: 50,000 lbs\n\nProcess Description: The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to two high pressure receivers (HPRs).  Liquid is again transferred from the HPRs to two low pressure recirculators (LPR-1 and LPR-2), the glycol chiller package, and the wine chillers.  Associated with LPR-1 is a liquid transfer vessel (LTV-1) where excess liquid ammonia can be routed back to the HPRs.  Pumped liquid from LPR-1 is sent to a wine chiller and several jacketed tanks (500 series).  The second low pressure recirculator "

The liquid ammonia in the chillers and jacketed tanks partially vaporizes as it absorbs heat from product being cooled. The resulting liquid/vapor mixture is returned to each recirculator, respectively in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from the recirculators is then pulled to the compressors, where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers, where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver (TSR) and the HPRs.  The liquid ammonia in the thermosyphon receiver is used to cool the oil in the three FES screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is syphoned back to the TSR.  The process also has an emergency control box which can be used in an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually diffuse ammonia through the ammonia/water diffuser.\n\n\n\nPlant 2 \n\nInventory: 160,000 lbs\n\nProcess Description: The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to a high pressure receiver (HPR).

At the wine chillers and glycol heat exchangers, liquid ammonia partially vaporizes as it absorbs heat from the wine product or glycol flowing inside these units.

These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety controls to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose "

Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP and trained in the evacuation procedure.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration systems, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Woodbridge Winery has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.  In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n"
