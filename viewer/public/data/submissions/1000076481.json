Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nBermco Aluminum handles chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of out co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's \"Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of any potential affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.     The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBermco Aluminum is a secondary aluminum smelter that uses chlorine for demaging operations.  Chlorine is received by truck.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 30,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenatio(s), including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which is heavier than air.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is 4.30 miles.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary."

The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) is 1.8 miles.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\r\n\r\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  Routine maintenance and component checks will still be performed weekly to insure safety and performance of this system.\r\n\r\n5.     Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been one accidental release of chlorine within the past five years. No one was hurt.  \r\n\r\n6.     The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's \"Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"  We have discussed this program with the Birmingham/Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City Fire Department.  In the event of a fire or leak in the chlorine system area:\r\n\r\nA.  Alert the main office, plant, fire department, police department, and all local emergency response agencies and teams.\r\n\r\nB.  Alert all employees and check all departments for fire, injuries or unsafe conditions.\r\n\r\nC.  Avoid inhalation of fumes or vapors released.\r\n\r\nD.  Management and Supervisors  to keep team members orderly and guided out of harms way.\r\n\r\nE. Tim Goff, Plant Manager and Barbara Poole, Environmental Manager will give direction and assistance to employees.  They will answer questions from local  authorities and assist in any effort to control or manage the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nF.  Fire extinguishers are located in all departments to put out small fires.\r\n\r\nG.  If an evacuation of the plant is deemed necessary, employees will be escorted to the front or"
