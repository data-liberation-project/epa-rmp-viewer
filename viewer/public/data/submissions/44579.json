The Tokio Terminal complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Tokio, WA Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nThe Tokio Terminal is a bulk terminal that receives propane by rail car.  Propane is stored at the Tokio Terminal and distributed by customer truck transports.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe Tokio Terminal has developed and implemented the following general accidental release and prevention program elements in accordance with all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) accident prevention rule, all the elements of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, NFPA-58 and all codes and regulations:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The Tokio Terminal has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes.  The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.  The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made.\n\nAccurate and complete process safety information enables the Tokio Terminal employees involved in operating and maintaining the terminal to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  Process safety information is used to conduct process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to a process.\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Tokio Terminal is committed to performing a detailed hazard analysis of each covered process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards in"

Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \nThe Tokio Terminal uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and check list PHA methodologies, which are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and / or mitigation measures.\n\nAs a minimum the Tokio Terminal performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.\n\nPHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented.  The Tokio Terminal has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule.  All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees.  All recommendations must be resolved by management.\n\nOperating Procedures: The Tokio Terminal has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that terminal operators and transport drivers must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.  The Tokio Terminal written operating procedures address various modes of process operations, including: (1) initial start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.  \n\nContractors:  The Tokio Terminal has developed and implemented a program to ensure that contractors used to supplement its workforce to perform maintenance, renovation or specialty work on or near RMP / PSM covered processes are qualified to perform the work and are informed of the potenti"

The training programs may include classroom, practical and computer-based training.  Employees are tested to demonstrate their understanding of the training and competency.\n\nManagement of Change:  The Tokio Terminal requires that a management of change (MOC) be performed for any modification to equipment, procedures, products and process parameters of a PSM covered process.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The Tokio Terminal requires that"
