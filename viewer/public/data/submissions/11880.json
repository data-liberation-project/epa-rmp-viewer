The Facility Policy\n     The owners, management, and employees of Ellsworth Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n     -The primary  activity at the facility is the storage and marketing of grain.\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n     -The maximum quantity stored would be 189,415 pounds stored in our 26,000 and 15,000 gallon tanks.The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a delivery truck containing 45,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n a. \nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 113,815 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 2.22 miles.\nb.\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a breal in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
