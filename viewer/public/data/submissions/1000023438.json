      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Bama Frozen Dough facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Bama Frozen Dough Safety Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nBama Frozen Dough maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Bama Frozen Dough facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 15.5\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigerat"

The total ammonia inventory is 55,000 pounds.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Bama Frozen Dough to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the Bama Frozen Dough employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the sy"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that Bama Frozen Dough has had no reportable ammonia releases in the last five years (June 2006 - June 2011).  However, the facility has had a few small releases within this time frame. The incidents are described as follows:\n\nDecember 2008 Incident\nThe Bama Frozen Dough facility had an ammonia leak on December 18, 2008.  An investigation into the incident revealed that there was a leak in the hot gas defrost coil in the spiral freezer drain pan.  Approximately 35 pounds of ammonia was released from the system.  The investigation showed that this leak may have been attributed to a poor weld on the drain pan defrost coil header during installation.  The weld was repaired and other adjacent welds were examined as a result.  There were no injuries resulting from this incident.  \n\nJuly 2009 Incident\nThe most recent incident occurred on July 22-23, 2009.  At about 3 PM on July 22, 2009, refrigeration technicians found that one of the recirculator pumps (RP-8) was leaking.  The leak was coming from the pump's oil reservoir.  The refrigeration technicians isolated the pump and tightened the bolts on its end plate to stop the leak.  The pump was put back into service shortly after the leak had stopped.  In the early morning of the following day, the pump started leaking again as two maintenance technicians were starting up compressors RC-2 and RC-8.  Liquid ammonia was spraying from the oil reservoir.  The maintenance technicians donned their respirators then isolated the pump to stop the leak.  An investigation into the incident revealed that the pump seal may have been contaminated when it was rebuilt on July 21, 2009.  In addition, the end plate for the oil re"

Approximately 7 pounds of ammonia was released on July 22, 2009 and 2 pounds released on July 23, 2009, for a total of 9 pounds.  There were no injuries that resulted from this incident.  As part of the incident investigation, recommendations were made to investigate the maintenance procedures on refrigeration pump rebuilds and to provide further training for personnel that rebuild the pumps. These recommendations were completed on August 13, 2009.\n\nIn the last five years, the facility has experienced minor releases similar to the December 2008 and July 2009 incident and there were no injuries resulting from any of these leaks. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBama Frozen Dough has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBama Frozen Dough has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was completed in December 9-10, 2008 and a PHA Revalidation was completed in November 4, 2009.  In addition, a PHA was conducted on July 21, 2010 to address the replacement of the defrost evaporator coil in the Spiral 1 Freezer, and on June 9, 2011 to address the addition of the evaporative condenser EC-7.  Recommendations that were generated during these studies to improve safety at the facility have been completed.  Bama Frozen Dough plans to further improve safety at the facility by conducting additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues.\n"
