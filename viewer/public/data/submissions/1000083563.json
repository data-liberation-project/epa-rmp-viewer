The Air Liquide HYCO facility's flammable syngas process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. \r\n\r\nREGULATED CHEMICAL\r\nThe plant's steam methane reforming process design basis is to provide a safe, clean and efficient way to produce high purity syngas using natural gas and steam methane as feedstock.  The purified gases are sold to Industrial customer(s). The plant also produces steam and electricity for sales to its customers. The plant is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe summary below discusses the process safety system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThe Freeport HYCO process equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards.  The equipment was designed by engineers. Documentation pertaining to the design of the process equipment is maintained. \r\nProcess hazard analysis by HAZOP has been used to identify potential concerns and ensure  mitigation to low levels of risk per Air Liquide policy.\r\nWritten procedures have been developed to address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action.  These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\nPersonnel  involved in operating and maintaining the syngas"

Employees take part in process hazard analysis and are trained on and are provided access to the Freeport HYCO syngas process safety information.\r\nAir Liquide has put in place a safe and hot work permitting system to help ensure worker and process safety can be maintained. This system addresses energy control and isolation, process (line) break, hot work, and confined space entry. \r\nWhere contractors are used to support the covered process the contractors must first undergo a pre qualification selection and then planned periodic monitoring process.  Individual contractor employees must attend annual site specific safety training.\r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nAir Liquide Freeport HYCO facility has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan (EAP). In the event of an accidental injury, fire and/or a process release .   The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is coordinated with Freeport HYC"

The Freeport HYCO EAP  includes information for notifying the Dow ERT, the Freeport Police, & Emergency Medical Services as well as other State and Federal agencies.   Air Liquide plant personnel routinely review and  training on the plan.  Emergency Drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidents or incidents with catastrophic consequences at this site since its commission.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Air Liquide Freeport HYCO resolves all findings of its PHA and other hazard reviews some of which result in modifications of the process. For example plant has in the prior 5 years upgraded the process distributed control system (DCS) software and the plant area monitoring system with new carbon monoxide sensors and light and heat sensing cameras ."
