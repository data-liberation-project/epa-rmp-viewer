The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to two of the covered processes operated at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nThe Facility is resubmitting the EPA RMP Registration to include the two covered processes that are being added to this Facility.  All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.   \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, fertilizer blending, and distribution.  Two chemicals (i.e. aqua ammonia greater than 20% ammonia concentration and anhydrous ammonia) are stored and handled at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\n\n\nCovered Process 1: Aqua Ammonia (AA) Storage and Handling \n\nCovered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (AA) \n\nCovered Process 3: Railcar Storage and Handling (NH3)\n\nCovered Process 4: APP Blending (NH3)\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for all four (4) covered processes.  The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single vessel were released. For the aqua ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Processes 1 and 2), the worst case release was modeled as if the 30,000-gallon aqua ammonia aboveground storage tank (AST) fails for some reason and releases all contents inside of the secondary containment at the maximum temperature.  For the anhydrous ammonia (i.e. representing Covered Proce"

      "SummaryText": "sses 3 and 4), the worst case release was modeled as if the 34,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature. \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario for Covered Processes 1 and 2 assumes a release of aqua ammonia due to a transfer hose failure during a transfer event from either the commercial tanker truck to the AST, or from the AST to stationary Blender.  The alternative scenarios are different for Covered Processes 3 and 4.  For Covered Process 3 (i.e. Railcar Storage), the alternative consequence analysis assumes that an operator fails to fully close the vapor valve on the railcar.  For the Covered Process 4 (i.e. APP Blending), the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a liquid transfer hose is severed during the blending process.  The alternative scenario for Covered Process 4 considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. excess flow valve on the railcar; and emergency shutoff valves on the MPR), and operating procedures that the Facility and Contractor implement to safeguard against ammonia releases from transfer operations.    \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Terminal Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Terminal Manager is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Terminal Manager is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 2 and 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY"
