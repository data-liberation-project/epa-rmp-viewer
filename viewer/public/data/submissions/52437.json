This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Reedley Packing and Cooling business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n2.\tDESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Reedley Cooling facility is a commercial packinghouse for deciduous tree fruit.  The facility has two ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with evaporator coils for cooling fruit.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \nThe systems operates as follows.  High pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it pas"

      "SummaryText": "ses through a solenoid valve and a hand expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessel located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver. \nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency dump box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\nThe ammonia systems at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels which are not directly connected.  Therefore, the each system is treated as a single process.\n3.\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Reedley Packing and Cooling facility are an"

It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.  Reedley Packing and Cooling has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nReedley Packing and Cooling has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n5.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \u00bfEmergency Action Plans.\u00bf  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u00bf and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond \u00bfminimally\u00bf to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Fresno County Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures"

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Reedley Packing and Cooling continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Reedley Packing and Cooling business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Reedley Packing and Cooling now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00bfliving document\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Reedley Packing and Cooling employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Reedley Packing and Cooling will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."
