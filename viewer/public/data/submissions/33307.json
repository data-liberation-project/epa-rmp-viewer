The Rich SeaPak emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Rich SeaPak facility is located at 3555 East 14th Street, Brownsville, Cameron County, Texas. The food processing operation utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its processes. Twenty-one thousand and five hundred (21,500) pounds of anhydrous ammonia are located in a single tank on the north side of the property. The container has manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency, and an alarm will be triggered if a release occurs. An emergency air supply and power are available. The facility is manned 24-hours a day. The anhydrous ammonia processes are checked routinely throughout the day. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SBCA) are stored straegically through the facility.\n\nThe Rich SeaPak accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: a strong adherence to Process Safety Management; a high level of training of the operators; a preventive maintenance program; the use of state of the art process and safety equipment; the use of accurate and effective operation procedures--written with the participation of the oerators; a perforamce of a hazard review of equipment and procedures;  and the implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nNo acccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Brownsville's Fire and Police Departments. Both of these entities are members of the Cameron County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The prog"
