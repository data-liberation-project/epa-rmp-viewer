      "SummaryText": "Chemical Distributors, Inc. (CDI) maintains a strong commitment to safety for the public as well as the environment through its Risk Management Program.\nCDI's program consists of hazard analysis and auditing of its processes that involve hazardous or toxic chemicals. Through employee training and constant monitoring and maintenance of internal equipment, CDI strives to eliminate the possibility of any off site impact that may occur during business operations.\nAt CDI, this includes in many cases maintaining much smaller inventory levels, strict adherence to the Department of Transportation's performance packaging requirements and working with local safety organizations such as the Buffalo Fire Dept and Buffalo sewer authority in designing and construction of our buildings. CDI also incorporates a security monitoring system to alert employees of any internal environmental changes during off-hours.\n\nCDI approaches accidental release prevention with the attitude of eliminating any potential problems. CDI is always looking for and developing new ways and ideas to minimize opportunities before releases occur. CDI utilizes quality suppliers and manufacturers in the field as a source of technical expertise as well as products. Working closely with these suppliers and manufactures allows us the ability to gather and utilize an increasing amount of safety ideas and methods that can put into action to improve our prevention program. \nCDI's senior management team believes that safety is our top priority and will spare no resources to obtain and maintain the highest level obtainable in our field. We have an ongoing commitment to the public and the environment to make the industry a safe place that we can all be proud of for years to come.\n\nCDIs' business environment embodies the true meaning of a distributorship. In our facility, we supply our customers with exactly what they require to keep them running efficiently 24 hours a day. In conjunction with the local fire department a"

      "SummaryText": "nd the University of Buffalo chemical engineering department, we have the ability to safely store a wide array of products and equipment.  Some products stored at our facility are concentrated versions of household cleaners used at an industry level for various water treatment and metal finishing applications. Other chemicals that are stored in bulk quantities as well as drum or smaller quantities may include metal finishing and plating products and pH control chemicals for treating water. \n\nCDI analyzes any potential conditions that may occur that would result in a release that would in turn involve public receptors. This activity is referred to as a worst case scenario release study. With this study in hand and the information received from it, we can adapt our process to minimize the off site impact on public receptors. All this information was calculated using an EPA modeling system called EPAComp. These are formulas developed by the EPA to assist in the determination of off site public impact.   Some of the efforts made by CDI to limit this event include dyking of the entire building to prevent any loss of liquid outside the premises. In addition all activities preformed are 100% manned operations, no processes are left unattended at any time. All of the chemicals listed in this report are kept in the smallest package containers possible to limit the amount  in the event of an accidental release.\nCDI complies with all of the government regulations that deal with the safe storage and handling of chemical products. The Department of Environmental Conservation as well as The Environmental Protection Agency dictate safe and practical practices to ensure the products stored will not have an adverse affect on the public or the environment.\nCDI has not had a release in the passed 5 years and makes every effort to continue this record.\n\nThe emergency response plan for CDI contains many parts, from the training of employees in chemical awareness to the notification of"

      "SummaryText": "government agencies and public interests. CDI prides it self on the training of employees with the many aspects of chemical awareness. Employees are trained in the areas of immediate action and containment in the event of a chemical emergency. Periodically drills are conducted to evaluate situational integrity of the plans. From this CDI can constantly improve their emergency preparedness plans.\nCDI maintains in its emergency response plan, set procedures on whom to notify in the event of a release. All phone numbers of government agencies as well as responding cleanup personnel are clearly documented and kept on file in the offices. Recently the Department of Environmental Conservation conducted an audit checking the soundness of the plan as well as the storage practices for the products kept at CDI and concluded the storage facility is maintaining proper safety practices.\nCDI is upgrading our storage and containment facility to meet new regulations in the up coming months. Parts of this will include new dyking for storage areas and transfer stations to eliminate the likelihood of a release during normal business activities. The newly revised transfer stations will be composed of specially treated concrete formed into catch basin areas that will contain the entire contents of a bulk trailer delivery. Should a leak occur, product loss will be contained and be able to be reclaimed without danger to the public or the environment.\n\nAll of these processes incorporated by CDI, help make the chemical industry as a whole, a safer facet of the business environment. Through dedication to these principles and a safety-orientated outlook towards business, CDI strives to maintain an accident work atmosphere. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThomas Russell"
