      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the Jefferson County ESD?s policy to operate safe wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Valley Creek WWTP.  It is ESD?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the Valley Creek WWTP.  Although not required by regulation, ESD has installed a chlorine / sulfur dioxide scrubber to reduce the risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment at the Valley Creek WWTP in the event of a release.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Valley Creek WWTP is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment plant.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used primarily for disinfection and dechlorination, respectively.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling biosolids in the clarification process.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 60,000 pounds (30 one-ton containers).  The chlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, chlorine gas dispensers, chlorine leak detectors, alarms, a chlorine / sulfur dioxide scrubber, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorinating the effluent before it is discharged into Valley Creek.  The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide that can be stored at the facility is 40,000 pounds (20 one-ton containers).  The dechlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, sulfur dioxide gas dispensers, sulfur dioxide leak det"

      "SummaryText": "ectors, alarms, a chlorine / sulfur dioxide scrubber, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Valley Creek WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP Rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a ?What-If? analysis.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nIn the past five years, the Valley Creek WWTP has not had a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide resulting in injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  Also, there were no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the 5-year period prior to the submittal of the 1999 RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Jefferson County ESD has an emergency response plan for the Valley Creek WWTP, which coordinates response efforts with the Bessemer Fire Department, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the Valley Creek WWTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems."
