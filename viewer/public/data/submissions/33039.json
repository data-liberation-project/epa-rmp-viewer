      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe North Little Rock Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures. In June 2001, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP) purchased the facility, which has handled Butane since 1997 without a harmful release. If an emergency were to occur, it is MMP written policy to notify the North Little Rock LEPC and request they responsd to the emergency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe North Little Rock Terminal is a bulk fuel (refined petroleum) terminal facility, occupying 41 acres with 20 above ground storage tanks and seven pressure vessels. The pressure vessels accommodate the recipt of butane and to facilitate subsequent butane blending operations. This is the only regulated process governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP. Storage at the facility may be incident to transportation and may not be regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nGERERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe facility is compliant with the thirteen(13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance proceedures. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The butane storage and distribution system is governed by OSHA's PSM regulation. The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the tanks and equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been no accidental release from the butane blending process at the North Little Rock Terminal that has required reporting under the RMP rule.

      "SummaryText": " Little Rock Terminal has never had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. The terminal is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Within the past five years, the process has no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP. The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed and reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nA gate valve was installed on the Butane Injection system to allow terminal personnel to isolate the flow-control valve downstream of the pumps in order to conduct calibration and maintenance activities. The upgrade was conducted using the MOC process."
