A summary of those scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario is provided in the appropriate section of this Risk Management Plan.\n \nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n \n\n4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nValero follows Department of Transportation and Texas Railroad Commission regulations that are appropriate to pipelines and underground storage facilities.  These regulations include DOT 195, Railroad Commission of Texas Statewide Rules and Railroad Commission of Texas Barbers Hill Special Field Rules.\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include:\n \nEmployee participation programs, process safety information, process hazard analyses, operating procedures and training, mechanical integrity programs with training, contractor programs, incident investigation, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, compliance audits, and hot work and safe work programs.  Additionally, Valero has implemented various safety programs addressing safe personnel protective clothing and equipment, hearing protection, safe entry and exit controls, impact protection and secondary containment controls, and a detailed analysis and adherence to generally accepted industry codes and standards.  We have additionally adopted the Houston Area Safety Council training program to assure that only qualified contractor personnel may enter the facility.  Valero (and the prior refinery owner) has made every effort to assure compliance with OSHA PSM, dating back to 1992.  The"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n \n\n5 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \nWithin the past five years, the processes had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b) (1)).  \n\n6 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n \nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan through Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu. \n The Emergency Planning and Response plan consists of four elements: prevention, preparedness, response and recovery.  \n\nPrevention is supported by policies and procedures intended to assure the plant is operated in a safe manner.  Inspections and audits of practices assure that the policies and procedures are being followed.  Periodic reviews of the procedures and training serve to reinforce the importance of operating the plant in a safe manner.\n\nPreparedness includes development of emergency procedures, obtaining and installing emergency equipment and notification devices, development and training of a plant emergency response team, coordination with neighboring companies, local authorities and CIMA (Channel Industries Mutual Aid).  The plant has a written Emergency Planning and Response Manual and a team t"

The facility has a system of alarms, radios and telephones that can be used to communicate with employees neighboring facilities and local agencies.  Periodic drills are conducted for likely scenarios, and emergency pre-planning is conducted for many recognized emergency events.  A review is conducted following each drill to assess the effectiveness of these preparations. \n\nResponse is conducted under the Incident Command System (ICS) as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120.  There are ICS trained personnel on site at all times.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and CIMA are the points of contact for offsite agencies.\n\nRecovery procedures include incident investigation, damage assessment, clean-up and restoration.  In addition, a review of the emergency response is conducted to evaluate and improve the response plans for the future.\n\n\n7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \nWe are continuously investigating and reviewing technology and / or applications that could possibly enhance our safety efforts.  We are constantly reviewing and revising existing procedures, developing new procedures, and researching methods to increase employee awareness.  \n\n8 CERTIFICATIONS\n \nWithin the past five years, the processes had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b) (1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP plan.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true accurate, and complete.\n \n\nDate   "
