At a minimum, PSG employees will: (1) participate in the development of the site specific PSM and RMP programs and will participate in their implementation, (2) participate in conducting the chlorine process hazard analysis, (3) be trained annually on the PSM and RMP programs and any changes made to the program systems or processes, (4) will work with management to develop additional programs or procedures relative to chlorine process safety as needed, and (5) participate in the periodic audits of the chlorine process and the Chlorine PSM Program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPSG believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe North Canadian Wastewater Facility has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsibility for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe North Canadian Wastewater Facility utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.
