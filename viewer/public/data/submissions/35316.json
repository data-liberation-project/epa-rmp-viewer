The NRFP has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements.  A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at this facility is described below:\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals. The City has also established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodical basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. To increase employee safety and awareness, the City:\n? maintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures\n? performs regular preventative maintenance, \n? provides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and \n?conducts periodic safety drills.\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\nNorth Reservoir Filtration Plant is an unmanned facility which utilizes surface water supplies to produce potable water through filtration and disinfection operations.  City employees regularly inspect the facility to ensure proper operation of the chlorine facilities.\nThe regulated substance handled at the NRFP is chlorine. \n\nRelease Scenarios \nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility. The release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation.\n\nAccident History \nThere has been no release of the covered chemical in the past five years \n\nEmergency Response Program \nNorth Reservoir Filtration Plant has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.

The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect facility and regulatory changes \n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety \nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards. \n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, a process hazard analysis of the chlorine system was conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements. During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation will be or has been considered for implementation. In addition, the exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes"
