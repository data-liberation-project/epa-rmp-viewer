      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Frozen Foods, which is owned by C.H. Guenther & Son, Inc., operates a food manufacturing facility in Prosperity, South Carolina, that prepares and freezes baked goods for commercial use.  \n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Pioneer Frozen Foods because the plant handles and stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of threshold quantities.  The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in the freezers.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, !?112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Pioneer Frozen Foods is committed to the safe operation of their facility to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Pioneer Frozen Foods, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the local fire department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods involves the handling and storage of one chemical, anhydrous ammonia, in excess of thresholds specified in !?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of !?112(r), Pioneer Frozen Foods management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Programs have been established to prevent accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release, including maintaining a trained medical emergency response team.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Pioneer Frozen Foods is in compliance with the OSHA PSM requirements and has conducted a process"

      "SummaryText": " hazard analysis on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThere is only one RMP-covered ammonia process at Pioneer Frozen Foods - the Main System.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios have been updated using EPA's guidance document, Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004). A copy of Appendix E is included as Appendix E to this document. \n\nPioneer Frozen Foods has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  Pioneer Frozen Foods maintains current operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures; a trained medical emergency response team; and an evacuation plan for each area.  \n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. \n\nPioneer Frozen Foods' management is committed to the following:\n\n-    Preventing accidents;\n\n-    Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-    Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n-    Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Pioneer Frozen Foods operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n-    Being a good corporate citizen of Newberry County.\n\n    With these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about Pioneer Frozen Foods' management of the risks associated with operating the ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods.  Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community.\n\n"
