The facility has a fully trained and equipped fire brigade and emergency response team.  The terminal maintains a large inventory of fire fighting apparatus and emergency response equipment and materials.  The terminal conducts annual full-scale emergency response exercises which are coordinated with local, county and state emergency management agencies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn an on-going effort of continuous improvement, the facility continues to identify and implement additional safeguards identified during facility change reviews, process hazard analyses, annual audits and annual emergency response exercises."

The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment.  The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals.  The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occur.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nAn RMP is required for IMTT's Bayonne terminal since the facility has an on-site inventory of a flammable material, butane, in excess of the threshold quantity of 10,000-lbs.  Butane is received in railcars and off-loaded at rail Yards 4, 6 & 9 for gasoline blending.  Butane railcars are only on-site during this seasonal operation, typically August through March.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIMTT-Bayonne maintains a comprehensive accidental release prevention program, known at the Risk Management Program (RMP).  The RMP addresses requirements of both USEPA's accidental release prevention regulation and NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).\n\nThe RMP includes written programs and procedures to identify and manage potential hazards related to butane handling.  Key elements of the RMP program include, but not limited to:\n\n-  Maintaining updated and accurate process safety information, including piping & instrument diagrams.\n-  Process hazard analysis (PHA) reviews.\n-  Written operating procedures.\n-  On-going operator training.\n-  Management of change procedures.\n-  Mechanical integrity program, including inspections and tests of safety systems and equipment.\n-  Active on-site Emergency Response Team.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidenta"
