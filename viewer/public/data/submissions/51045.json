The natural gas is run through three compressors on site and then into process equipment that includes, a three stage seperator, a glycol dehydrator, a Joule-Thompson skid and a flash separator.  Natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the incoming field gas and is collected and stored in two co-located 30,000 gallon horizontal tanks with a secondary containment wall.  The two 30,000 gallon (NGL) tanks are the main hazardwhen considering off site consequences.  The contents of the NGL is 18.28% propane, 24.59% Butane, 7.32% Iso-butane, and 49.81% Pentane plus longer chain hydrocarbons.  The tanks are chilled and under pressure.  At atmospheric conditions the contents of the tanks would become a gas so that the opportunity for a vapor cloud explosion is possible if there was a rapid depressurization of the tanks.   A management system comparable to OSHA's PSM and containing the 12 elements listed in Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program has been written.  A written facility emergency response plan has been developed and employees are trained in the procedures in the plan.  Emergency response arrangements have been made with the Weavertown Environmental Group for spill response and TEAM Industrial Services, Inc. for pipeline emergencies.

The objectives of the IHMP are to protect employee health, determine chemical/physical agents being used and employee's exposure levels to those agents, control exposures, and minimize risk.  Major elements of the plan include a hazard communication (HAZCOM) program, a personal protective equipmnt (PPE) program, respiratory protection program, bloodborne pathogens exposure control program, lead compliance program and benzene policy.

The facility has the ability to store 60,000 gallons of natural gas liquids, a 2,100 gallon tank of methanol and five 300 gallon tanks of methanol hydrate inhibitor, three 500 gallon steel double walled tanks of engine oil, and several 55 galon drums of triethylene glycol.                                                                                                                                                                                  The two 30,000 gallon NGL tanks have an automated emergency shutdown in the event of a rapid depressurization which is powered by compressed nitrogen.  Secondary containment is included in storage areas that hold regulated substances.  Relief valves are set to allow excess pressure to escape a vessel at 250 PSI and are included in all of the major process equipement.  A series of check valves and backpressure valves ensure that the gas stream flows in the correct direction in the event of an equipment malfunction.
