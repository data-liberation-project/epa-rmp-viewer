This Risk Management Plan (RMP) encompasses all the elements of the Risk Management Program. Accidental release prevention, and emergency response policies at the Chickasha Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) Emphasize safety, training, and maintenance.\n\n\n\nThe Chickasha WWTP is located in Chickasha, Oklahoma, at or near Latitude N. 35.02.38 and a Longitude W. 97.55.18.  Chlorine is used to disinfect waste water and Sulfur dioxide is used to remove Chlorine prior to discharge in the Washita River. The Chickasha facility treats on an average of 2.5 Million gallons a day (MGD) and is designed to treat 6 MGD. The facility will have the maximum of 8,000 lbs of chlorine and 7,200 lbs of Sulfur dioxide on site at any one time. The chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders, 2 on process and up to 2 on standby, Sulfur dioxide is stored in 1-ton cylinders and 150 lb cylinders. Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide is drawn from the cylinders in a gaseous state.\n\n\n\nThe Chlorine, Sulfur dioxide cylinders and feed systems are checked at least twice daily for leaks and feed rates. The preventative maintenance program has numerous operator and maintenance checks to ensure full and proper operation.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario has been estimated, per EPA guidance, to provide the greatest distance in any direction to the established toxic endpoint. The worst-case release quantity, established by the regulations, is the greatest amount of chlorine held in a single vessel. Chickasha WWTP worst-case is 1 Ton (2,000 lbs). In accordance with 40CFR section 68.25, chl"

      "SummaryText": "orine gas released at a rate of 200 lbs a minute with a ten-minute release.\n\n\n\nNo administrative controls or active mitigation measures were included for the worst-case release scenario. Tables from the EPA and Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO) Risk Management Program Guidance for Waste Water treatment plants were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario, a distance of 1.3 miles. \n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history was evaluated to determine a likely alternative release scenario.  No releases.\n\nUSW Utility Group has developed accidental release response and prevention programs in the form of Risk Management Plans, Emergency Action Plans, Training with local emergency responders, Operator training, Operator inspection of the Chlorine, and Sulfur dioxide systems and preventative maintenance.\n\n\n\nUSW Utility Group will conduct training with local emergency responders (Chickasha Fire Department) more frequently. Operators will be trained and drills conducted as per the facilities RMP. \n\n\n\n"
