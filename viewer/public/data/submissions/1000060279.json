Titanium tetrachloride is supplied to the site in portable containers.  The material is stored in the Titanium Tetrachloride building prior to use in the continuous Armstrong production process for the manufacture of titanium powder.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe titanium tetrachloride handling and reaction process is operated in accordance with the USEPA Prevention Program 2 requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental releases of titanium tetrachloride at the Cristal Metals facility in the last five years that have resulted in significant property damage on site; no injuries or deaths have occurred on site.  There has been no accidental release of titanium tetrachlordie which has resulted in offsite death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nOur employees do not respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substance, but rely on local emergency responders when there is a need.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly. The emergency response plan includes training for plant employees"

We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.\n\n\n\nScaling down activities:\n\nWe plan to reduce the amount of titanium tetrachloride at the site below teh RMP threshold by the end of 2017."
