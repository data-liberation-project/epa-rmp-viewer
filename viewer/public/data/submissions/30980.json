Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Rhodia, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances; and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur Winder, Georgia facility's primary activity is the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.  These products are used in the manufacture a variety of consumer goods, including personal care products such as soaps, shampoos, detergents, and textile processing aids.  We also make polyester based polymers which are used for soil release in detergent applications and in textile processing..  We presently have 3 substances at our facility, which are regulated under the EPA RMP regulations.  These are Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Methylamine  [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-].  Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for production of Episulfonate Solution - an intermediate used to produce surfactants for Industrial and Personal Care Products.  Methylamine  [Methanamine] is used for Methyl Taurine - a surfactant for commercial cleaning applications.  Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] is used for production of ASC Intermediate, which is used to produce an end product used in various Industrial and Personal Care Products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 285,000 lb. Methylamine  [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] are present on-site at our facility in maximum quantities of"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Episulfonate Solution process.  In this scenario, a full railcar of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is released.  Passive mitigation systems such as a berm are taken into account to determine release rates and quantities. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] involves a release from a gasket leak in the Epichlorohydrin transfer line from the storage tank to the Episulfonate Solution manufacturing vessel.  The scenario involves the release of Epichlorohydrin liquid, which is assumed to be limited by an excess flow valve and our emergency safety shutdown system.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our MonoMethylAmine storage tank.  In this scenario Methylamine  [Methanamine] in a flammable aqueous solution is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity of the storage tank is released, vaporized, and then finds an ignition source.  \n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a hose break while unloading 40% Dimethylamine from a tank truck.  The scenario involves the release of Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] in a flammable aqueous solution.  Active mitigation controls taken into account to calculate the scenario for this system is that the unloading is a fully attended operation - We estimate that the operator will stop unloading within two minutes.  \n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a hose break while unloading 40% Methylamine from a tank truck.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition, and other nationally recognized safe design standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRhodia, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes What If, HAZOP, and Layers of Protection Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations plus experienced operations personnel. The safety studies are revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update for Methyl Taurine and use of MonoMethylAmine was performed on 3/5/2003.  The most recent PHA update for ASC Intermediate and the use of Dimethylamine was performed on 10/9/2002.  The most recent PHA update for Episulfonate Solution and use of Epichlorohydrin, was held on11/28/2002.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWe maintain written Equipment Operating Procedures addressing safety and quality speci"

These procedures are controlled to ensure that the current version is readily available to operators involved in the processes. The combined sets of procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, shutdown and emergency shutdown.  The procedures are reviewed at least every three years and are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  The procedures are certified as current on an annual basis.\n\nTraining\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent in the Operating and Manufacturing Procedures associated processes, and equipment for which the employees are responsible.  Refresher training is provided periodically.  Training on handling, use, and hazards of raw materials and products is conducted regularly.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWe have a formal documented Mechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program. Regularly scheduled maintenance checks on process equipment ensure proper operation.  Process equipment covered by the system includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls and pumps.  Qualified contractors complete some periodic inspections and tests, other inspections and tests are carried out by our own qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Plant personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by inspections and tests are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at our facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

The most recent reviews for RMP covered processes was performed for Epichlorohydrin / Episulfonate Solution on 4/22/97; for Dimethylamine / ASC Intermediate on 7/16/1999; and for Methylamine / Methyl Taurine on 5/30/1995.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nRhodia, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulations are properly implemented at the Winder facility.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 8/23/2002.  Corrective actions required as a result of these audits are promptly implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAt our Winder facility, Process Safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning all aspects of Personnel Safety; Process Safety; Accident Prevention; and quality issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, o"
