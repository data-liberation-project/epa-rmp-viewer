The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case scenario is the complete rupture of the completely full epichlorohydrin tank.  The tank contents would be released immediately into the secondary containment diked area.  Using the EPA OCA methodology, the material would evaporate at a rate of 22.7 lb./min., and would create an area with concentrations above the  toxic threshold out to a distance of 0.6 miles (3190 ft.).  The list of potentially impacted receptors is:\n1. AFA Pallet\n2. NJ Transit bus repair facility\n3. Sun Chemical facility\n4. Reichold Chemical facility\n5. General Chemical facility\n6. Darling Delaware facility\n7. Passaic Valley Sewage Authority\n8. Newark Bay Cogeneration facility  \n9. Miles Inc. facility\n10. Louis Dreyfus Energy\n11. Texaco sales Terminal\n12. Amerada Hess\n\nAdministration controls include inventory control, training, constant surveillance, preventive maintenance, and Process Safety Management measures.  Mitigation measures include the secondary containment dike, emergency response plan, training in spill control, and contacting of outside agencies and closest neighbors.     \n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n1.  For epichlorohydrin, an alternate scenario involves a failure of the unloading line while a tank wagon of the material is being unloaded to the storage tank.  It takes 1 minute to get the truck pump shut off and stop the flow from the truck.  492 lbs. are released into the tankwagon loading area dike.  Using the EPA OCA methodology, the material would evaporate at a rate of 1.89 lb./min., and would create an area with c"
