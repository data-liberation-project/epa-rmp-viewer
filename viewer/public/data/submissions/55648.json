It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\r\n\r\n\tCFC refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\r\n\r\nAt CFC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\r\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\r\n* Reduce the threat to the community\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nCFC is a group of fruit processing and cold storage facilities, located near the city of Chelan, county of Chelan, city of Pateros / Brewster and Okanogan, county of Okanogan, state of Washington."

It is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.  It is shipped as a liquefied compressed gas.  It is easily liquefied under pressure.  Its chemical symbol is NH3.\r\n\r\nMolecular Weight:  17.0\r\n\r\nBoiling Point:  -28 F \r\n\r\nFreezing Point:  -108 F\r\n\r\nSpecific Gravity:  0.68  \r\n\r\nVapor Density:  0.6\r\n\r\nVapor Pressure:  8.5 atmospheres\r\n\r\nUpper Flammable Limit (UFL):  27%\r\n\r\nLower Flammable Limit (LFL):  16%  [note - the LFL may be lower with the presence of oil in the ammonia]\r\n\r\nExpansion Ratio:  850 to 1\r\n\r\nBoiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE):  Flame impingement on a pressure vessel has the potential of causing a BLEVE.\r\n\r\nSpecial:  Although ammonia does not meet the US Department of Transportation (DOT) definition of a flammable gas (for labeling purposes), it should be treated as one. \r\n\r\nSpecial:  Ammonia decomposes into nitrogen and hydrogen above 600o F.\r\n\r\n\r\nToxicity Data and Exposure Limits\r\n\r\nDescription:  Ammonia is considered an Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nThreshold Limit Value-Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA):  25 ppm\r\n\r\nShort Term Exposure Limit (STEL):  35 ppm\r\n\r\nImmediately Dangerous to Life & Health (IDLH):  300 ppm\r\n\r\nRoutes of Exposure:  Inhalation; skin & eye contact\r\n\r\nTarget Organs:  Eyes, skin, and respiratory system.\r\n\r\nSymptoms:  Irritation of eyes, nose and/or throat.

It is important to keep potential incompatible materials away from areas that have the highest potential of a release, such as pressure relief devices.\r\n\r\n   Ammonia is stable and hazardous polymerization will not occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrosiveness\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is corrosive to certain materials, including brass, bronze, copper, cuprous nickel, nickel copper, phosphor bronze, tin, and zinc.  It is also corrosive to human tissue.\r\n\r\nIron and steel are suitable for use with ammonia, if iron contamination is not a problem.  Rusting will occur, particularly in the vapor space of tanks, but the attack diminishes with time as the vessel becomes \u00bfseasoned\u00bf.\r\n\r\nSolutions of ammonia and ammonium nitrate (used for fertilizers) are intensely corrosive to carbon steel, even at ambient temperatures.  Corrosion can be reduced by the use of an inhibitor.\r\n\t\r\nAmmonia increases corrosion in nitrate solutions and solutions of other acid-forming anions because acidic constituents are formed upon hydrolysis, and because of the ability of the ammonium ion to form complexes with iron in steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (68.67)\r\n\r\nA team of CFC personnel conducted a complete PHA by use of the \u00bfWhat-if\u00bf method.

The type of refrigeration system used is a \u00bfflooded\u00bf system, using a float switch and an electric operating solenoid valve for liquid level control and a back pressure regulator to control temperature.  In this process the liquid refrigerant flows from the liquid receiver through the liquid line, up to the electrically operated solenoid valve.  The evaporator in this system consists of a tubed coil.  It contains an electric solenoid valve, which maintains a constant level of liquid refrigerant under a low-side pressure. Vaporized refrigerant moves through the suction (vapor) line to the compressor where it is compressed to a high pressure and discharged into the condenser.  It is cooled by the condenser, returns to a liquid and flows into the liquid receiver.  There is currently, approximately 28,000 pounds of NH3 on the Chelan site, 17,655 pounds on the Pateros North site, 23,215 pounds on the Brewster site and 23,827 pounds on the Okanogan site.
