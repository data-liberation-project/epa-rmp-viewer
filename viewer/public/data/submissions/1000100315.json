Utilizing pipelines allows Rubicon to reduce storage of these chemicals and it promotes less handling of these chemicals due to less loading and unloading.  Pipelines also benefit the public because there is less vehicular transportation of these chemicals through their neighborhoods thus lowering the possibility of accidents. \n\nRubicon conducts business safely and effectively which is demonstrated by our outstanding safety record.  Rubicon has, for the last 56 years, effectively managed our systems to minimize risk to our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Rubicon is committed to maintaining this high standard of performance and plans to experience many more safe, productive years in this area.  Rubicon is committed to improving the safety at our facility for our employees, our near neighbors, and our community."

These external communication systems inform and coordinate efforts with neighboring chemical plants, the APSO, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Louisiana State Police and/or the general public.\n\nRubicon works closely with outside authorities and other neighboring companies to coordinate emergency response.  These authorities are Louisiana State Police, APSO, Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, Geismar Fire Department, Prairieville Fire Department, Red Cross, Our Lady of the Lake Ascension Hospital (Gonzales), Our Lady of the Lake Regional Hospital (Baton Rouge), Baton Rouge General Medical Center (Baton Rouge), Ochsner Medical Center (Baton Rouge) and the Industrial Mutual Aid Group (IMAG).  The Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness has the ability to facilitate the activation of the National Guard Civil Support Team to respond to an on-site emergency.  IMAG also has reciprocal agreements for equipment exchange with the St. James Mutual Aid and Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid Systems.  Rubicon performs annual training with most of these organizations or provides information necessary for coordinated emergency response.\n\nRubicon has also developed formal emergency action plans such as the SPC/SPCC Plan, RCRA Contingency Plan, and the One Plan for emergency situations.  Rubicon also has emergency internal procedures that address Emergency Action and Crisis Management, Emergency Brigade, 888 Emergency Notification Telephone System, Radiation Sources, Plant-wide Evacuation, Bomb Threats, and Hurricanes and Parking Area Emergency Notification System.  Preplanned emergency responses are practiced and are used during release drill scenarios.

      "SummaryText": "tions that could possibly lead to an emergency incident are the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards, conducting process hazard analyses, safety procedures, the management of change system, unit operating policies and procedures, continuous process control and monitoring, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of equipment.  The second and third elements of Rubicon's emergency response program are preparation and response.  Preparing for emergency situations at Rubicon includes exercises and drills for the training of the internal emergency response units.  The internal emergency response units are the Fire Brigade, HAZMAT personnel with equipped van, medical first responders with equipped ambulance and a first aid station with nurse, and teams specializing in vertical and confined space rescues.  Formal written fire and release preplans have been developed to assist training and drill scenarios.  A plant-wide evacuation drill for all employees is performed at least once per year.\n\nAnother important aspect of preparation for an emergency is communication.  Rubicon has the following internal communication systems: central alert notification system, 888 emergency notification telephone system, two way radios, public announcement system in the units, fire alarms, gas alarms, telephones, cellular telephones and faxes.  External communication systems include the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) radio, the telephone system with backup switch and power, cellular telephones, and the use of 911.  Upon using the CAER radio or 911, Rubicon coordinates with the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office (APSO) the activation of all or part of the CAER emergency sirens that are designed to be heard within an approximate radius of 2.5 miles of each plant in the area where the CAER chemical facilities are located.  This coordination can also activate the computerized Emergency Telephone Alerting System provided by the Commu"

Rubicon has management systems in place that provide for the assessment of risks associated with the manufacturing and handling of chemicals and for the continuous improvement of associated processes.  Rubicon's philosophy is prevention first, through the use of good engineering design and nationally accepted standards.  In addition, Rubicon conducts process hazard analyses, establishes EHS and unit operating policies and procedures, utilizes continuous process control and monitoring, and performs inspection and testing of equipment.\n  \nFive Year Accident History\n\nRubicon has had one incident within the last five years:\n\nOn September 22, 2022, a release occurred during a maintenance activity in the MDI 2 unit. Approximately two pounds of a liquid mixture of Aniline, formaldehyde and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was released to secondary containment.  A contractor was exposed to aniline while performing duties as the \u0093hot zone\u0094 attendant. The contractor showered in the nearest safety shower and was escorted to Rubicon Medical for additional showering and observation.  While at Rubicon Medical, the contractor\u0092s vitals indicated potential cyanosis and the contractor was transported to Our Lady of the Lake Ascension Hospital for further evaluation.  While at the hospital, it was determined that the contractor\u0092s methemoglobin levels required administration of the methylene blue antidote.  The contractor was admitted for overnight observation and was release the following day on September 23, 2022.  The Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office, the Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Chemical Safety Board were notified when the contractor was transported to the hospital.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRubicon's emergency response program is based on the philosophy of prevention, preparation and response.
