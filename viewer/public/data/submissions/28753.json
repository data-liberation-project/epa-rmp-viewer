      "SummaryText": "Transok / Canute Gas Plant RMP / Executive Summary\n\n\nA.    Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Transok's policy for the design and operation of gas plants is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to and attempt to control and contain the release.\n\n\nB.    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nTransok operates the Canute Gas Plant located 7 miles south and 1 mile west of Canute, Oklahoma in Washita County.  The Canute Plant receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called \"residue gas\") is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \n\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Canute Gas Plant, are NGL's (product), methane and condensa"

      "SummaryText": "te.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Canute Plant.\n\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.   In addition, the Canute Gas Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Therefore, the Canute Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accident Release Program\n\n\n\nC.    Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.    Worst-Case Releases\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case scenario (WCS) release of a flammable substance is a 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is from the NGL storage tank (i.e. product surge tank) with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.39 miles.  This is based on using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" dated May 24, 1996.   The storage capacity of the largest (& only) NGL storage tank is 35,000 gallons, which is limited to 80% or 28,000 gallons by administrative controls.  It assumes the entire contents of the tank (28,000 gallons or 110,110 pounds) is released instantaneously and is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analys"

Alternative Releases\n\nAlternative releases scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for NGL's as follows:  \n\nA 2 inch valve on the 35,000 gallon, 250 psi, product surge tank fails and releases contents undetected for a period of 30 minutes.  This volume released of 30,785 pounds then participates in a vapor cloud explosion resulting in a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 0.25 miles. This is based on EPA equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" document. \n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of each regulated toxic substance is not required.\n\n\nD.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Canute Gas Plant. The processes at the gas plant are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.  They are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Release Prevention (APR) Program under EPA's RMP.\n\n1.

Employee involvement will help ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. In addition, this is mandated as part of Transok Corporate Policy #SA4 - Employee Participation and is further identified in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant strongly encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of this include a cross-section of employees and management ad hoc teams participating in:\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis \n* Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n* Audits\n* Operating Procedures Development\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant also actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at monthly safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employee suggestions on improving safety processes are encouraged at these meetings. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are also documented in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\n2.    Process Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  New operators are also paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

The Canute Plant receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called \"residue gas\") is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  The natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.\n\n\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \n\n\n\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Canute Gas Plant, are NGL's (product), methane and condensate.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Canute Plant.\n\n\n\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.   In addition, the Canute Gas Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM).

The Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is from the NGL storage tank (i.e. product surge tank) with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.39 miles.  This is based on using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations found in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" dated May 24, 1996.   The storage capacity of the largest (& only) NGL storage tank is 35,000 gallons, which is limited to 80% or 28,000 gallons by administrative controls.

Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Canute Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility:\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Canute Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n\n\n3.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high  temperature)\n\n\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process con"

Five -Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  The plant was constructed in 1998 with operations commencing in April 1998.  Since that time there have been no incidents that have had offsite effects. \n\n\n\nF.    Emergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant maintains written emergency response procedures, which are in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency response procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant facilities.  The emergency response procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Canute Gas Plant is coordinated with the Washita County, Oklahoma, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which may include local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Canute Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response"

The Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan for the plant also identifies emergency response procedures and notification contacts.\n\n\n\nG.    Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Canute Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned over the next few years in response to PHA, safety audit, and incident investigation findings:\n\n\n\n*     Revisions/enhancements to personnel training programs\n\n*      Revisions to operating procedures\n\n*     Revisions/enhancements to contractor safety programs\n\n*     Revisions/enhancements to mechanical integrity program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCanute RMP    11     03/11/99\n\n\n\nB-5\n\n\n\n"
