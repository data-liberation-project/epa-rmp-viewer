ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering \nsafety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY, located in Tuscaloosa, AL, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, butane,) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several \nregulated chemicals. Two LPG ( Liquefied Petroleum Gas) products, Propane and  \nButane, are flammables from that list.\n\n3.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  There have been no accidents with \nany offsite consequences in the last five years.\n\n5. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY.   Because processes at \nthe refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\na) Employee Participation\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident \nprevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include the safety and health committee that promotes both process and personal safety.  This committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nb)\tProcess Safety Information\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY keeps a variety of \ntechnical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Information summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency \nresponse/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).The refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety \nfeatures in the process are not compromised.\n\nc)  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as, accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for \nresolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is \nbased on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nd)  Operating Procedures\n\nThe HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY maintains written \nprocedures that address various modes of"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the HUNT REFINING COMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY \nmaintains documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\ne)  Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the HUNT REFINING \nCOMPANY, TUSCALOOSA REFINERY has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such \noperations.
