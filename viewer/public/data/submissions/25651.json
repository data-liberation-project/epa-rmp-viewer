              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites  local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of GREAT LAKES COOPERATIVE are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the storage tank is 120,000 pounds. Additional product can be stored in mobile nurse tanks approximating 98,750 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be a release of the total contents of a [storage tank] released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the [largest storage tank] as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative release scenario is .19 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhy"

Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Tiltle III (EPCRA);\n\n- a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\nPersons who can be contacted in the event of an emergency (in order):\n\n                    Gary Wolthius, plant manager\n                             WORK:   (712) 262-6650\n                             24-hour: (712) 262-5613\n\n                    Steve Loerts\n                             WORK:   (712) 262-6650\n                             24-hour: (712) 262-5338\n\n                    Tom Clark\n                            WORK:    (712) 262-6650\n                            24-hour:  (712) 262-9204\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are perfromed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
