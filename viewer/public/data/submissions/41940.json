Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and hydrofluoric acid solutions, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to repackage and distribute chlorine and to distribute sulfur dioxide to water treatment facilities and general industry.  We also distribute hydrofluoric acid solutions to general industry.  In addition, we also manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) as a byproduct of the chlorine repackaging operation.  Chlorine is received by rail cars and sulfur dioxide is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers (no packaging of sulfur dioxide is done at this facility).  Hydrofluoric acid solutions (49% and 70% concentration) are received in 55 gallon drums (no packaging of hydrofluoric acid is done at this facility).  Chlorine from rail cars is used to fill DOT approved containers.  Access to the site"

The maximum total inventory of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 30,000 pounds.  The maximum total inventory of hydrofluoric acid solutions (70% concentration) is 45,000 pounds.  Average inventories are much less.\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment and personal protective equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.  Our response program covers chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Emergencies involving hydrofluoric acid will be handled by outside contractors.  We are part of this area\u00bfs emergency response program and work closely with the Fire Department to improve safety.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1949.  The chlorine pac"

We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nIn 2003, we developed a new security plan to help guard against intentional misuse of hazardous chemicals.  We are continuing to evaluate and implement new security measures by sharing knowledge with other Harcros facilities and general industry."
