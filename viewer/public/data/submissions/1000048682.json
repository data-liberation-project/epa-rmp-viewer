      "SummaryText": "RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The FTP 1 ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  \r\n\r\nOther safety features at the facility include: \r\n \u00bf\temergency shutdown systems\r\n \u00bf\tcomponent specific safety shutdowns\r\n \u00bf\tpressure relief valves on all vessels, compressors, and several other areas in the system where trapped ammonia could build pressure\r\n \u00bf\tthe installation of a PRV relief headers has been completed per previous PHA recommendation\r\n \u00bf\tpreventive maintenance program has been reviewed to verify that all ammonia system components are included and maintenance frequencies are appropriate per previous PHA recommendation\r\n \u00bf\tammonia detection system is connected to an automatic phone dialing system\r\n \u00bf\tactivation of ammonia detection system closes liquid solenoid valves to production area ammonia equipment\r\n \u00bf\tengine rooms are equipped with ammonia detection systems\r\n \u00bf\tboth engine rooms are equipped with emergency shutdown switches\r\n \u00bf\tengine rooms are equipped with ventilation systems\r\n \u00bf\tammonia pipes, valves and components are labeled\r\n \u00bf\ta fire sprinkler system is installed in the majority of the plant including the engine rooms\r\n \u00bf\toperators receive ongoing training in operations, maintenance and emergency response\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility, Foster Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system.

Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the ammonia system at the facility.  The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a discussion of accidents involving a release of a reportable quantity (RQ) of ammonia that have occurred at the facility within 5 years prior to the request for submitting the RMP or that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage within 5 years of the request for submitting the RMP.  FTP 1 reports there have been no reportable accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nFoster Farms has developed a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that identifies emergency personnel responsibilities, procedures, evacuation measures and reporting requirements.

The Incident Commander will take charge of the emergency response and response team and direct all operations when an emergency is declared and will remain in charge until the emergency is ended.  The ERP addresses ammonia specific issues as required by the RMP/PSM standards, including a determination of incidents that constitute an emergency.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms has developed the ERP to assure compliance with RMP/PSM requirements. The Plant Manager will maintain the ERP.  Additionally, a copy of the ERP will be kept with the RMP/PSM documentation and at other appropriate locations. Refer to the ERP, for further information regarding emergency planning and response.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  The mitigation measures suggested by the 2010 process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  Others resulting from the 2015 PHA revalidation will be implemented during the next two years. Existing administrative and engineering controls for the ammonia system identified as ongoing during the 2014 HAZOP will be reviewed at least every 4-months to assure that they are ongoing.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly and is scheduling completion of proposed actions.  Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility.

In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on support services provided by the local fire department and hazardous materials response team.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Compounds Handled\r\nFTP 1 is located at 500 F Street in Turlock, California.  The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses, residential development, and small agricultural properties.  The site is bordered by F Street to the northwest, 5th Street to the northeast, industrial businesses and residential development to the southeast and southwest. FTP 1 is approximately one mile east of Highway 99 and one quarter mile west of Golden State Boulevard.\r\n\r\nThe facility was originally constructed in the late-1950s.  The refrigeration system was remodeled in the mid and late-1980s.  Foster Farms purchased the plant from Butterball Turkey Company in July 1999.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughtering, storage, processing, packaging, and distribution of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and is staffed by a refrigeration operator or mechanic 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The system provides cooling for production areas, product, and water chilling.
