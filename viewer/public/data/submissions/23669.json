      "SummaryText": "2367 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nREVISED RMP SUBMITTED JUNE 2001 FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:\n\n1)\tOn January 1, 2001, the Novartis St. Gabriel Plant and the Zeneca St. Gabriel Plant (adjoining) were merged to result in a new combined facility owned by Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc.  Each facility had previously filed an RMP; Novartis registered as EPA Facility Identifier No. 1000 0009 2614 and Zeneca registered as EPA Facility Identifier No. 1000 0009 5675.  THE RESULT OF THIS SUBMISSION IS THAT THE ZENECA RMP PROGRAM IS BEING ROLLED INTO THE NOVARTIS PROGRAM AND THE FACILITY NAME IS BEING CHANGED TO SYNGENTA CROP PROTECTION, INC.  The Zeneca process is being included in this submission as MMU (Micro Manufacturing Unit).\n2)\tAll elements of the RMP, including worst case scenario's, alternative case scenario, and five year accident history have been reviewed and updated as required.\n3)\tThe maximum potential on-site quantity of ammonia is being increased from 3,000,000 pounds to 3,800,000 pounds in the HCN/Sequestrene/HPF process.  This is being done to accommodate a new process which will utilize ammonia as a raw material.  This new unit will not store ammonia or any other regulated compound above the threshold levels and as such is not a regulated process.  The ammonia transfer line, however, is considered a part of the HCN/Sequestrene/HPF process.  This activity does not alter the worst case nor the alternative case scenario for ammonia.\n\nThe Syngenta St. Gabriel Plant manufactures and formulates pesticides and specialty chemicals.  Specific processes include: 1) manufacture, formulation and packaging of s-triazine herbicides, 2) manufacture of hydrogen cyanide, a raw material, 3) manufacture, formulation, and packaging activities for various other pesticides, herbicides and specialty chemicals, 4) process development activities, and 5) supportive activities for the above, which include effluent treatment systems, maintenance, utilities, and analytical and quality contro"

      "SummaryText": "l.\n\nSafety in Syngenta Crop Protection's St. Gabriel Plant site is incorporated into all aspects of plant operation and is foremost in the design, maintenance and operation of every process.  The facility is guided by an operational philosophy that safety shall not be compromised for economy.  \nSyngenta is proud to be certified as an OSHA STAR facility.  As one of over 750 workplaces in the US, we have verifiably achieved a level of safety performance far surpassing our industry counterparts.  Additionally, our major resident contractor has also achieved this level of safety performance and Federal recognition making us one of  only a few sites in the US to have the host employer and nested contractor with such accolade.  \n\nThe following information fulfills the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155;\n\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\nSyngenta is committed to safety.  This commitment is supported from the corporate senior management down to the plant workers.  Employees at Syngenta participate in several groups committed to safety at the plant.  These include a Safety Incentive Committee (SIC'M), Unit Health and Safety Committees, and an Employee Health and Safety Committee.\n\nSyngenta also has a strong commitment to the environment.  Several programs are run on-site by employees to assist in this commitment.  These include a spill prevention committee which has been successful in reducing the number of on-site spills from 1992 by more than half and an Employee Environmental Committee which runs a comprehensive recycling program and has developed and maintains a nature trail.\n\nSome of our awards and recognition's which reflect our strong safety and environmental commitments include: Charter member of the National Environmental Performance Track program, Award for Pollution Prevention Activities (LaDEQ), Certified Corporate Habitat Program (Wildlife Habitat Council), Forest Stewardship Certification (Department"

These are evident in several plant policy and procedures, including Plant Procedure A-1, which is the Statement of Policy.  This procedure states that safety is a primary concern at Syngenta and that it is the policy of the St. Gabriel Plant management that safety is a definite job requirement at every level of the organization.   \n \n More relevant to the Risk Management Program is Plant Procedure C-8 which is entitled Process Safety Management Standard Compliance Procedure.  The purpose of this procedure is To establish measures (per Process safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.11 and Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68) to ensure that accidental releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals are minimized and procedures are in place to lessen the consequence should  large release occur.\n \n (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n \n In order to best comply with the requirements of this initial RMP submission, Syngenta has separated the facility into  several processes.  Of these, the  processes subject to RMP and the regulated substances handled by these processes are as follows:  \n MPF Unit - anhydrous hydrogen chloride; hydrogen; anhydrous ammonia\n Development Pilot Plant - bromine; vinyl acetate; phosgene; chlorine\n HCN/Sequestrene/HPF and associated Tank Farms - anhydrous ammonia; sulfur dioxide; formaldehyde solution; ethylenediamine; hydrocyanic acid; chlorine; isopropylamine; ethylamine\nMMU - Toluene diisocyanate\n \nNote that in completing Section 7.0 of the RMP, the description of the prevention programs for these units, Syngenta"

This was done because the Process Hazard Analysis for each of these is done independently of the others.  Also note that the information provided for each of these represents  the entire unit and  associated chemicals as opposed to  describing only the regulated compounds.\n \n (c) The worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit distances for each reported scenario;\n \nAs required by the RMP regulations, Syngenta has conducted and is providing the required off-site consequence analysis of potential releases.  This information is provided in a table format at the end of this summary.\n \n (d) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n \n Syngenta is regulated by the Process Safety Management regulations and as such conducts various process hazard analyses to prevent accidental releases from the facility.  These analyses are conducted on unit equipment as well as processes and procedures.\n\n Syngenta also has comprehensive procedures for inspection and maintenance of equipment.  The Syngenta Maintenance Department maintains a Preventive/Predictive Maintenance (PM/PDM) Manual.  This comprehensive manual documents the system used to ensure that maintenance and inspections are conducted effectively and efficiently and that closure is attained on recommendations resulting from these activities.  The PM/PDM incorporates inspection plans designed to enhance safety, environmental integrity, operational reliability, and protection for plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n \n Syngenta also conducts extensive employee training.  Some of this training is done via a Computer Aided Training System (CATS) allowing on demand training around the clock.

      "SummaryText": "e five-year accident history;\n \n Syngenta has had one incident in the last five years that qualifies as an accident reportable under the RMP Five-year Accident History.  On July 18, 1999, a release of approximately 125 pounds of ammonia occurred due to a gasket leak.  Although no off-site or on-site injuries or environmental damage occurred, approximately 1,200 residents were requested to shelter-in-place as a precautionary measure.  As a result of this incident, Syngenta has revised the method of gasket replacement as well as the appropriate operating procedures.                                                          \n                                                                                                                      \n(f) The emergency response program;\n\nSyngenta is a very proactive participant of the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) committee as well as having close involvement and interaction with the Iberville Parish Emergency Preparedness agency (the local LEPC).  The facility is part of the community emergency response plan and has a facility emergency response plan.  Both plans include specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Syngenta, in conjunction with the LEPC, has several mechanisms in place to notify the surrounding community including an automated dial-up phone system, activation of a televised public announcement and a strategically placed community siren system.  Syngenta also has on-site first aid and emergency medical responders, a hazmat team as well as emergency response equipment including a fire truck and ambulance.\n\n(g) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAs a result of the HCN Super PR/OP, a high integrity  safety system was installed in the HCN and Sequestrene Units.  The system provides dedicated safety functions in both units as well as watch-dog functions for the process control system.  In addition some of the older"

This is being done to coordinate long term safety objectives and help further improve our excellent safety record.\n\nLong term commitment to safety is evidenced through the implantation of new safety initiatives which focus on 24 hour safety. One of the goals of management at this site is for safety first to be the mindset of all employees.\n\nThe site currently tracks all spills, even small spills contained completely within secondary containment.  The current electronic incident tracking system is being expanded to include electronic spill reporting to replace the current paper reporting system.\n\nThe following supplemental information is provided as supporting information to the preparation of this RMP submission.\n\nAs recommended by EPA, Syngenta obtained the information on  the potentially affected population from LandView III.  This software is based on the 1990 census and provides two methods of determining the population within a given area.  Syngenta chose to use the  Block Group Uniform Density  as opposed to the Block Group Centroid Method as it is felt that this method gives better estimations.  However, due to the calculation technique used in this method, it was found populations were given in areas which clearly have no residents.  For instance when the impact area was only over industrial areas.  In these cases, Syngenta did not rely on the LandView III information.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario Information\n\nToxic Chemical - Ammonia\nScenario - Gas release of entire storage tank contents\nOff-site Impacts - Schools; residences; hospitals;  prisons; recreation areas; industrial areas\n\nFlammable Chemical -Isopropylamine\nScenario -Vapor cloud explosion of entire tank contents\nOff-site Impacts - Ind"
