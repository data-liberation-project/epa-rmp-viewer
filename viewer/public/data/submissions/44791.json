Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Thoms Proestler Company has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n1.1.     Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nThoms Proestler Company is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining a\"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1.     It is the policy of Thoms Proestler Company to:\n\n1.1.1.1  Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2  Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3  Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n1.1.1.4  Ensure, through training, and whe"

Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3.     Thoms Proestler Companys aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials where ever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4.     Thoms Proestler Company has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.     The first duty of Thoms Proestler Company employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.     Thoms Proestler Company Facility Description\n\nThoms Proestler Company is a food processing facility that receives and prepares the shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products to their end users.

Anhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System\". Approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is contained and used in various vessels, compressors, piping, and evaporators used throughout the refrigeration process.  A single machine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery, vessels, piping and motor control centers.\n\n1.3.    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\n1.3.1.    As stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1) the worst-case release scenario was calculated and the results are on file at the Thoms Proestler Company facility. \n\n1.4.    Alternate Case Release Scenario\n\n1.4.1.    The alternative release scenario was also calculated according to the EPA guidelines and is on file at the facility. \n\n1.5.    Emergency Response Program\n\n1.5.1.    Thoms Proestler Company is equipped with an emergency information system.  Evacuation plans are placed throughout the facility to inform personnel in an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia, or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Thoms Proestler Company Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n1.5.2.    Plant personnel have received required emergency evacuation training as outlined in OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38"
