The Risk Management Program rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, ?Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Provisions? (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or highly flammable substances.\r\nAgri-Mark stores 12,900 pounds of ammonia at their manufacturing facility on 869?Exchange Street in Middlebury, Vermont.  Agri-Mark is required to address the requirements of the CAP regulations because they exceed the 10,000 pound ammonia threshold. \r\nAgri-Mark owns and operates the Middlebury facility, which produces cheese and other dairy related products.  The purpose of the ammonia is as a heat transfer medium for the facility?s refrigeration system.  A total of 12,900 pounds of ammonia is maintained in the closed loop refrigeration system.\r\nAgri-Mark is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29?CFR 1910.119.  The State of Vermont has been delegated authority for OSHA compliance.  There are also a number of other chemicals used at the facility, which are addressed in Agri-Mark?s EMERGENCY RESPONSE Plan.\r\nThe Risk Management Plan contains the Policies and Procedures used at Agri-Mark to assure continued compliance with the EPA CAP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Most of the documents that are part of the Risk Management Plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step instructions.

Typically, documents are periodically revised through the procedures outlined in SECTION 9 - MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE.  \r\nAll employees are strongly encouraged to review the Risk Management Plan?s policies and procedures.  The manual is available for review by any employee at any time.  Any recommendation to improve a document?s accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to management.\r\nThe goal of the Risk Management Plan is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. \r\nThe phrase Risk Management Program refers to all of the requirements of Part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis. The phrase Risk Management Plan refers to this document as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.  In general, the Risk Management Plan requires that:\r\n* Covered facilities must develop and implement a Risk Management Plan and maintain documentation required by the plan on site.  The Risk Management Plan will include an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.\r\n* Covered facilities also must submit registration information (RMP Submit) to EPA no later than June 21, 1999 or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in use or stored at the site, whichever is later.  Covered facilities are also required to re-submit their Risk Management Plans every five years."

This section discusses various duties that must be addressed in order to fulfill the intent of the Plan.  This section also describes the employee responsibilities associated with each duty.  \r\nMr. Bernie Boudreau, Plant Manager, and his designees are identified throughout this document as the Risk Management Program Coordinators (RMPC).\r\nSection 3 - Hazard Assessment\r\nA major component of the Risk Management Plan is the assessment of impacts associated with the accidental release of regulated substances.  This section evaluates both the worst-case release as well as alternative releases that are specific to the site.\r\nThe analysis focused on the impact to neighboring areas called receptors.  Receptors include residences, schools, parks, prisons, commercial buildings, etc.  Graphic as well as tabulated exhibits help to define the impact of accidental releases.\r\nBased on guidelines provided by EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\r\nSection 4 - Process Safety Information\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is a repository for information related to the safety of a process.  Three major subjects addressed in this section are:\r\n* The hazards of the chemicals and the process (physical properties, toxicity and exposure limits, fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability, corrosivity data).\r\n* The process technology (process chemistry, process flow diagrams, safe operating limits, maximum intended inventories, consequences of deviation).\r\n* Equipment information (pipin"

Operators at the facility reviewed and commented on draft procedures developed by Tighe & Bond.  The Operators comments are included in the final procedures incorporated into the Risk Management Plan.\r\nOperating procedures are reviewed on an annual basis by Agri-Mark.  Substantive changes to the procedures are noted in a controlled manner.  If substantial changes to the ammonia system require revision to the operating procedures, such changes are tracked through the management of change process.\r\nSection 7 Employee Training Program\r\nInitial training must be provided for employees involved with Risk Management Program processes that cover an overview of the process, specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown and other safe work procedures that may be applicable.  For existing employees, the employer must document that operators have the required knowledge and do not need initial training.  Refresher training must be provided periodically that covers understanding and adherence to current operating procedures.  Records must be kept that verify that an employee has received and understood the training; these records must include employee identification, date of training and method of verification.\r\nDocumentation is found primarily in the Training Files.  This file should contain evidence that employees had input into retraining frequency and other aspects of the training program.\r\nInitial regulatory training was provided on March 8, 1999.

Certification involves verification that procedures and practices for Risk Management Program elements are adequate and are being followed.  The audit must be performed by a team, with at least one person who is knowledgeable in the process.  A report must be generated that documents deficiencies and corrections.\r\nTypical documentation should include completed compliance audits, including evidence of how recommendations were implemented and attendance sheets from any meetings conducted to review the audit findings with employees.\r\nTighe & Bond conducted a compliance audit of Agri-Mark?s ammonia refrigeration system and Risk Management Program on July 8, 2002.

This information is used as a reference during Process Hazards Analyses.\r\nDocumentation is found primarily in the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), the Risk Management Plan and the Process Safety Information files.  \r\nSection 5 - Process Hazard Analysis\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a systematic approach toward evaluating the safety of a process.  PHAs must address the hazards of a process, previous incidents having potential for serious consequences, engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors and an evaluation of the range of exposures if controls fail.  If there is more than one process, a schedule for completing PHAs must be formulated and be based on the extent of process hazards, the number of potentially affected employees, the age of the process and the operating history of the process.  Employees must have input into the prioritization of PHAs and this schedule must be fully communicated to all employees.  PHAs must follow a standard methodology, such as a What If/Checklist Analysis and be performed by a cross-functional team with at least one person who is familiar with the process, at least once every five years.  A system for addressing, resolving, documenting and communicating all recommendations in a prompt manner must also be in place.\r\nTypical documentation should include information on how PHA studies were prioritized, employee briefings on the PHAs, a copy of each PHA file index and evidence of how PHA recommendations were completed.
