      "SummaryText": "US Filter at Elementis Executive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nAt this US Filter site we use Sulfur Dioxide,  which is considered a toxic gas by the EPA. The\nSafety of the community and employees is our first priority.  We strictly follow all state and federal\nregulations including:  Occupational Safety and Health Admininstratio's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119)  Sara Title III,  Emergency Action and Fire Protection Plan (29 CFR\n1910.119 and the Respirator Protection Plan (29CFR 1910.134).  Through safety training, testing,\nreponse drills, procedure reviews, safety device checks and preventative maintenance,  US Filter strives to provide the safest plant possible to both the community and our employees.  Our committment is\nshown in our acceptance into the Carolina STAR Program.\n\nOur Emergency Response Program includes mutual aid response with Elementis Chromium.  All of the US Filter operators and Elementis Emergency Response team are 40 hour Hazmat certified and participate in annual drills.  The emergency response plan includes notification to Elementis security, New Hanover County Emergency Management, Wilmington Hazmat and Castle Hayne Fire Department.\n\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substance Handled.\n\nAt the US Filter,  we purify Sodium Sulfate for Elementis Chromium.  In the Purification process, Sulfur Dioxide is used to reduce Hexavlent Chrome to Trivalent Chrome. Sulfur Dioxide is also used for this reduction in the Elementis Waste Water Treatment Stream.  The liquid Sulfur Dioxide is received by truck every 6-12 weeks,  with a maximum on site storage of 83.000 pounds.  The average quantity kept on site is 30,000 pounds.  The storage tank is located in its own building with dual gas detectors and an autmatic ventilation System.  The liquid sulfur dioxide is transfered by pipe to the evaporator,  heated to a gas ,  and fed to the process via vacuum injection.  When then gas leaves the building it is"

      "SummaryText": " under vacuum.\n\n3.  Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Scenario- Complete failure of the full Sulfur Dioxide storage tank would result in the release of 83,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide gas.  Using the EPAs RMP Comp modeling program the distance to toxic endpoint is 7.3 miles.  Complete tank failure is highly unlikely as the tank is protected with relief valves and a brick building.  Also, the liquid sulfur dioxide eveporates to a gas and escapes, the bulk liquid temperature drops,  reducing the release rate to near zero before the tank evaporates.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios-  The alternative case assumes the tank is overfilled.  The 3 inch pressure relief valve opens for 10 minutes.  Using the EPAs RMP Comp modeling program, the distance to endpoint is 0.3 miles and the quantity released is 3,480 pounds. While this release would extend beyond US Filters' boundaries, there are no public receptors within the 0.3 mile radius.  Elementis and Martin Marietta are the property owners.  The Emergency Response Plan includes notification to both companies of a release including a 'Sheltering in Place\" response.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Plant falls under OSHAs Process Safety Management.  Compliance with PSM includes: a comprehensive mechanical integrity plan,  hazop studies, detailed procedures,  Management of Change,  proceure revision review and approval,  training procedures , testing and documentation.\n\nHighlights of our release prevention program include:  weekly safety/interlock checks,  daily process checks and documentation,  pressure relief valve testing and certification,  relief valves are protected with rupture discs and pressure alarms at lower pressures,  UT thickness testing and thermalgraphic imaging. Operators are trained, tested and drilled annually on release mitigation.  Remote Isolation Valves were installed on inlet and outlet lines which can be operated by"

      "SummaryText": " emergency personnel both on-site and off-site.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nSince start up in June of 1997,  this plant has not had a sulfur dioxide release.\nThe plant personnel have never had a lost time accident or illness.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nOur emergency reponse program includes four hazmat trained operators donning SCBAs and encapsulating suits while being backed up by the Elementis Emergency Response Team.  In the meantime, the Wlmington Hazmat Team and New Hanover County Management Team would be responding as well.\nThe ERP describes six likely emergency scenarios which could occur during loading and a suggested response for each.  Non-essential personnel from both Elementis and US Filter are instructed to Shelter in Place.  The US Filter control room has an emergency shut off for the HVAC.   The US Filter operator notifies the Elementis Security of the emergency.  The security personnel then triggers the Emergency Siren and the Emergency Contact List.  This sends everyone to their assigned 'shelter in place' zone for a headcount which is sent to the Elementis Security Guard for reconciliation with the plant entry system.\n\nOn 02/20/02 we held a sulfur dioxide tabletop session with Elementis, Castle Hayne Fire Department, the New Hanover Emergency Management Team, the Wilmington Hazmat team and the Coast Guard to discuss the coordination and what if scenarios of an accidental  release.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSince the plant was built we have made several improvements which included:\nRemote Inlet and Outlet Isolation Valves. Man Down Sensors with automaic emergency notification,\nSurveillance cameras with motion sensors and emergency notification.  Remote (off-site) PLC control\nWe plan on improving the level of training for PSM by an outside agency.  We are implementing an Asset Management Survey that will improve our level of PSM beyond compliance."
