Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\nAt Don's Cold Storage, we utilize anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuble as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Don's strives to protect all its valuable recources and assets-both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, exisiting natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through  continual, accurate training and various saftey devices and prodedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Rogers Fire Department and the Benton County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary pupose of our facility is the temporary storage of refridgerated and frozen foods.  We utilize anydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigerationand freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main reciever tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility emloyees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 22,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to limit the Distances for each reported Scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario would be failure of our largest reciever"

Our worst case figures this vessel at 100% This is resonable and prudent in consideration of the associated quantities of NH3 contained in the condensers and thermosiphon oil coolers that interconnect to this vessel.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two-phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).\nDistance to endpoint:1.3 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure relief valve.  The emergency valves shutdown release would engage and stop the flow and sounds an alarm.  The monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 120 minutes and maximum quantitiy released would be approximately 7200 pounds of Ammonia.\nDistance to endpoint: 0.1 miles ( or 283 yards)\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThis is a newly constructed facility that opened in Spring of 2007.  To date, Don's Cold Storage facility has not incurred a reportable release.\n\n5.  The RMP Management Program.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by the Maintenance Manager.  He/She will administrate in conjunction with the Don's Cold Storage management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated to include the Benton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Rogers Fire Department.\n\n6.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nDon's Cold Storage facility complies with all applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard communications Traininig, and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-The-Job training.  They are given oral tests and are observed and able to demonstrate proper"

Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.\n\n7.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\nDon's Cold Storage has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditoins.  We have monthly meetings as well as annual certification.  This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release.\n\nWe work closely with the Benton County LEPC and the Rogers Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Saftey.\n\nCurrently, Don's trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and out total ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed annually and updated periodically.  Our program is improved continuously through annual training and updated written programs.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available."
