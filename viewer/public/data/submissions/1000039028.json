The program includes written descriptions of the Codes and Standards necessary for the safe system design for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Written operating procedures are used for training operators and emergency personnel to operate, maintain, and inspect equipment as well as the necessary steps to follow in emergencies.  To strive for a coordinated and effective program, particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each program element. There is a single person identified as having overall responsibility for each element.  The program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is reviewed every 3 years to ensure compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements.  Findings and recommendations are documented.  A follow-up report of the audit documents findings and actions taken.  A process hazard analysis is done for the entire system, and repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated for the hazard analysis to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Pacific Surimi-Newport LLC's intent that the PSM/RMP for the Newport, Oregon facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment. Following the work practices implemented at the facility, only incidental releases of ammonia have occurred due to routine maintenance procedures or normal equipment wear and tear.\r\n\r\nRelease Considerations\r\nFollowing program guidelines a \u00bfWorse Case\u00bf release of ammonia was analyzed. Several alternative (more likely to occur) releases were considered. Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report. The alternative releases"

The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases has been used to develop an emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.\r\n\r\nFive year release history \u00bf No Releases\r\nThere have been no releases exceeding the reportable quantity of ammonia (100 pounds) in the last five year period.  Incident investigations are done to determine the cause of accidents or near misses, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan\r\nPacific Seafood-Newport LLC Oregon facility has a written \u00bfEmergency Response Plan\u00bf that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release. Many of the operating personnel have been trained to the Hazmat Technician level, and receive annual refresher training.  \u00bfDefensive\u00bf actions are taken in the event of an ammonia release to protect plant and nearby personnel.  Trained facility responders working with local emergency responders combine for emergency response.  The facility works with the local emergency responders on an annual basis to assure good coordination between on-site and off-site resources for an ammonia release as well as other emergencies.\r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Improvement\r\nThis facility holds monthly safety meetings with all Management Staff, Lead Personnel, and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment. Engineering staff meetings are held weekly during system operation. Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon. Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated annually or as needed to assure that all operations are done in a safe and effective manner"
