      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nRMP Executive Summary \n \n1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1    SOURCE\nThe Prairie Farms Dairy in Fort Wayne, Indiana is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 10,100 pounds (i.e., 2,000 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 4,300 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 2,600 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Fort Wayne plant is located in an urban setting.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe two screw compressors draw suction from the vertical suction trap, which is connected to the ice builder and glycol chillers.  The York 12 cylinder reciprocating compressor draws its suction from the horizontal suction trap, which is connected to the other local units.\n\nDuring normal (typical) operation, the York 12 cylinder is not operated and the suction from the horizontal trap is diverted to the screw compressors by means of a cross over valve.\n\nAmmonia liquid which collects in the two accumulators is returned to the high pressure receiver by pumper drums.  An interrupter valve is used to create a pressure differential between the receiver and the pumper drums when the pumper drums operate.\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system."

      "SummaryText": "These include safety relief valves (SRVs), engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.  \n\nSRVs protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, and suction accumulators from overpressurization.  SRVs on the high side are set at 250 psig.  SRVs on the suction vessels are set at 150 psig.\n\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cut outs for the compressors as well as high level floats and sensors for the vessels.  The high pressure cut-outs for the compressors are set at 200-225 psig.  The system also includes a solenoid-operated liquid main valve which is controlled and shut down from the accumulator controls. \n\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios required by 40 CFR 68.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the"

      "SummaryText": "What-if/checklist technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \n\n3.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (since June 2004) that have resulted in death, injury, or s"

The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents related to a release of ammonia.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of the facility.  The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n5.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe prevention program that is described in Section 2.0 of this Executive \nSummary is a management system that is designed to proactively identify, \nevaluate, and reduce the potential for a ammonia release and/or a release's \nimpact or consequence, due to failures in process, procedures, and \nequipment.  As safety improvements are identified by the management \nsystem they are evaluated and, where appropriate, implemented.  For \nexample, the facility may implement the following changes to further improve the safety of the process:\n\n* Additional training,\n* Periodic repair and replacement of equipment, and\n* Continued implementation and improvement of the PSM program."
