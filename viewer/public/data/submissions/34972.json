      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of water borne disease in drinking water.  The are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consist of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The chloramination process lowers the trihalomethane levels in the finished water.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in the finished drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The John E. Preston WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals, including ammonia as seriously as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n\n- Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\n\n- General Facility and regulated substance information.\n\n- Summary of the accidental release"

Preston WTP chlorine system is provided below. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the EPA?s Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe MDWASD emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored, to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.  John E. Preston WTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the treatment plant facilities to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance information\n\nThe MDWASD John E. Preston WTP is located at 1100 West 2nd Avenue in Hialeah, Florida.  John E. Preston WTP is bounded to the North by West 13th street, to the South by West 9th Street and the Hialeah Water Treatment Plant, and bounded to the west by West 3rd Avenue.  John E. Preston WTP covers 17.3 acres.  The facility stores chlorine which is regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.\n\nChlorine is delivered to John E. Preston WTP via 90-ton rail car enclosure.  The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The rail car enclosure has a capacity of four cars but typically houses two chlorine rail cars.  The chlorine system at John E. Preston WTP provides a total of approximately"

Preston WTP also supply chlorine for the Hialeah WTP.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the John E. Preston WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\nThe vapor pressure of the stored chlorine forces the liquid through the tubing and into the manifold system.  Downstream of the manifold system there is a pneumatically actuated shut-off valve.  Pressing one of the emergency shut-off switches manually closes the shut-off valve.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator room.  The liquid chlorine flows through the shut-off valves to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The two important  safety features are (1) shut-ff valves and (2) chlorine leak detection and alarm system.  These two major safety features are located in the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator room.\n\nThe shut-off valves in the chlorine car enclosure are located immediately downstream of the co"

The valves are located on the two liquid chlorine supply lines that enter the chlorinator room.  As with the valves in the chlorine car enclosure, the shut-off valves in the control room are operated manually by pushing the emergency shut-off button.  The nearest shut-off button is located on the exterior wall of the chlorinator room.\n\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine car enclosure is tripped when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, audible and visual alarms (both local and in the control room)  are activated.  When the chlorine alarms are tripped, personnel are restricted from entering the contaminated area without the appropriate protective equipment.\n\nA chlorine leak detection and alarm system like the one in the chlorine car enclosure is located inside the chlorinator room.

The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Hialeah Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling chorine.  As part of the emergency response program, the John E. Preston WTP has developed and implemented and emergency action plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Hialeah Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, site response team, and site safety representative, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response"
