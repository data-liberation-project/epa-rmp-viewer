Tetra a privately owned micronutrient manufacturing facility in Fairbury, Nebraska.  Tetra maintains all of the equipment in its process by employing the best engineering practices in the industry.  Tetra strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of Tetra's policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk Management Program Tetra is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  Tetra is committed to the accidental release prevention program.  \n\n\n\nTetra maintains a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for the Ammoniated Zinc Process.  The plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others.  \n\n\n\n50 CFR 68.155(b)    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Tetra'a Ammoniated Zinc Process produced ammoniated zinc by feeding water, zinc chloride, citric acid, and anhydrous ammonia into a low-pressure reactor.  Alternating additions of zinc chloride, citric acid, water, and anhydrous ammonia continue until the batch is complete.  The primary function of the anhydrous ammonia is to raise the pH of the water/zinc chloride solution.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel under ambient temperature.  The pressure vessel has a 30,000 gallon or 150,000 pound capacity with a maximum fill level at 85%.  As the result, the normal operating amount of ammonia stored in the Tetra Micronutrient is 25,000 gallons or 125,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(c)    "

      "SummaryText": "The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\n\n\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an offisite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated substance.  In Tetra's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance.  Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 2.\n\n\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The largest quantity is determined by taking into account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a vessel at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel to store greater than usual quantities.   EPA defined alternative release scenarios to be any release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\n\n\nFor offsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated substance release to the atmosphere is predicted using the computer model called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere (ALOHA).  ALOHA predicts pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical characteristics of ammonia, the physical characteristics of the site, weather condition, and the circumstance of the release.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(d)    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTetra Micronutrient has a Release Prevention Program in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at this facility.

The preventive maintenance includes pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are developed or promulgated by equipment vendors, federal or state regulations, or industry codes.\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation\n\nThe current Tetra Micronutrients Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan is a component of the Incident Investigation process.
