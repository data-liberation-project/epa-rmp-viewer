The Facility Policy:\r\n\r\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC are \r\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local \r\nresponders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \r\nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the \r\nmanagement plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \r\nprepared to work with local fire departments, and authorities to mitigate any release, and \r\nto minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\r\n\r\nII.   Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to provide agricultural fertilizer for the farming \r\nindustry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \r\nAmmonia is received, stored, and used for production of  liquid fertilizer solutions.  \r\nAmmonia is an important source of nitrogen for agricultural crops.\r\n \r\nThe maximum quantity that can be stored in the stationary vessel is approximately 120,000 pounds. \r\nHowever, the facility has the capability of receiving ammonia via railcar and has therefore calculated\r\nthe worst case release quantity using the volume of ammonia typically stored in a railcar \r\n(approximately 134,000 pounds).  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by \r\ntruck transport containing 40,000 pounds. The process is considered a batch process and \r\nis operated as required to satisfy customer demand.\r\n\r\nII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\r\n   \r\nThe Facility has an internal written emergency plan to us as a guidance. The Facility \r\ntakes guidance from material published by the American National Standards Institute \r\nSafety Requirements  for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K61.1, and \r\nCompressed Gas Association CGA G-2.  The Facility also has a Process Sa"

The Facility is routinely inspected by the Illinois Department of Ag for                             \r\ncompliance to State ammonia regulations.\r\n\r\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\r\n       \r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \r\nin the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \r\nat the Facility.  To the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, \r\nsheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the \r\noperation of this facility."
