      "SummaryText": "Industrial Chemicals Corporation (ICC) is a small business engaged in the wholesale distribution of bulk chemicals.  They have operated at the Arvada facility since 1971 with an excellent safety record.  Although ICC handles a number of chemicals, only ethyl ether  and piperidine are covered under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.  ICC's Emergency Response Plan and overall Risk Management Plan were developed in the early 1990s for the entire facility, and ICC's RMP for ethyl ether and piperidine are based on these existing plans.\n\nPiperidine is delivered in 44,000-pound loads in a dedicated, 3-compartment tanker truck to the ICC facility.  The tanker truck is held on site until the customer requests delivery.  ICC delivers one compartment full (about 1850 gallons) to the customer and returns the partially filled trailer to the ICC facility.  Deliveries continue until the trailer is empty, at which time the trailer is driven to the supplier facility for refilling.  No transfers or processing occurs at the ICC site.\n\nThe worst-case scenario by EPA rule involves the entire quantity on the trailer (44,000 pounds).  The worst-case scenario for piperidine produced a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles.  Alternative scenarios for smaller spills produced maximum impact distances of 0.2 miles.  All spills would occur in a diked area at the ICC facility.\n\nEmergency Response to the ICC facility is coordinated by Southwest Adams County Fire Protection District.  They are the first responders and are responsible for calling in Adams County HazMat and other supporting organizations if needed.  They also provide incident command in the event of a large spill or fire.\n\nRisk management and emergency preparedness was a part of ICC's operations long before the RMP rule was published.  ICC's proactive attitued towards Risk management is reflected in the facility design, the operating procedures, the cooperation with local responders, and the employee's attitudes.  This RMP summarizes the ex"
