D?Arrigo has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document D?Arrigo policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe D?Arrigo Castroville facility provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Castroville.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Refrigeration System (\"System\").  This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, which was built in 1985 and expanded in 1994 and 1998. \n\nThe two largest vessels and most of the ammonia equipment are housed inside buildings. The remaining equipment and piping associated with the System is either under roofed areas or on the roof. The entire facility is fenced and gated.\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. A"

(The 1999 RMP Report used a previous RMP*Comp version which minimally considered enclosures; therefore overstating the endpoint distance.)\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system, in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario. The original alternate case scenario was modified to safety measures installed since the 1999 RMP Report. A second alternate case scenario was added to address the 2001 PRV release; however, the scenario does not reflect mitigating safety measures installed after the release.  \n  \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nD?Arrigo's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by D?Arrigo is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\nKey objectives of D?Arrigo Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1. Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2. Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by D?Arrigo.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3. Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under "

D?Arrigo certifies operators following completion of operator training and D?Arrigo's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\n5. Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all D?Arrigo employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6.    Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by D?Arrigo's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, D?Arrigo has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a D?Arrigo Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.

Verification of D?Arrigo's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by D?Arrigo personnel.  D?Arrigo has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n8. Minimize employee injury and illness.  (Addressed under D?Arrigo's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe D?Arrigo facility is had one (1) reportable accidental ammonia releases in the last five years, which occurred on October 1, 2001.\n\nD?Arrigo completed an incident investigation, which resulted in recommendations. D?Arrigo has implemented the recommended measures to reduce the possibility of a similar incident and mitigate a PRV release (thought the installation of an ammonia diffusion tank). \n\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nD?Arrigo's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the Castroville facility.\n\nThis plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \nUnder D?Arrigo's Emergency Response policy, D?Arrigo employees who have been trained as \"First Responders\" may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  D?Arrigo will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or "
