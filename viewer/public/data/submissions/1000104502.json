Most recently La Porte SMR executed the following safety improvement projects:\n\u2022\tModified boiler sight glass so that it is accessible and can be isolated while standing on the platform. It previously needed to be accessed from a ladder. (2022)\n\u2022\tUpgraded 18x20 Syngas piping tee to a new metallurgy to prevent future leaks.  (2022)\n\u2022\tCoated all ladder rungs in the plant with slip resistant coating.  (2022)\n\u2022\tChanged all rusted bolts on the natural gas piping flanges.  (2019)\n\u2022\tAdded a platform to access the steam turbine inlet vent so it no longer needs to be accessed by ladder.  (2021)\n\u2022\tUpgraded expansion joint material on combustion air fan to prevent future leaks.  (2022)\n\u2022\tUpgraded boiler blowdown stand pipe to a proper blowdown drum to avoid potential hot water exposure to employees.  (2022)\n\u2022\tUpgraded all steam traps in the plant to a better model less susceptible to failure and made each one isolatable while operating so that if one does fail it can be changed out online. This prevents continuous steam venting throughout the facility.  (2019)\n\u2022\tUpgraded the process gas boiler bypass valve. The valve would stick causing operations to have to force it with a wrench (safety hazard) when they needed to move it. Upgraded the design and packing and the valve has not gotten stuck in 4 years.  (2019)\n\u2022\tUpgraded the insulation on the hot combustion air preheater. This exchange had a history of cracking and releasing hot combustion air creating a safety hazard for employees.  It has not leaked in 4 years since the upgrade.  (2019)\n\nSafety Improvements Scheduled for 2023:\n\n\u2022\tUpcoming project - Update and add site cameras for increased visual monitoring.  (2023)\n\u2022\tUpcoming project - Update and add site cameras for increased visual monitoring.  (2023)\n\u2022\tUpcoming project - will be enclosing the fire"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Resolutions to the recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.\n \nIncident Investigation\nAir Liquide defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and reporting procedure.  Air Liquide documents incident and subsequent investigation, follow up actions, and closure.  Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings. \n \n Employee Participation\nAt the La Porte SMR, employees are expected to participate in accidental release prevention program (PSM/RMP).   Employees are trained on and are provided access to the hydrogen process safety information.  The specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan.

(Air Liquide) operates a steam methane reforming (SMR) process in in La Porte, Texas (the SMR is considered the covered process, as defined in the accidental release prevention regulations, having a flammable mixture in the process in excess of 10,000 pounds).  The SMR process involves reforming natural gas feedstock into hydrogen.  The hydrogen purification process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment. \n \nRegulated Chemical\nThe SMR process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using natural gas feedstock.  Purified hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s).  The La Porte Hydrogen Plant also produces steam and electricity, sold directly to nearby industrial customers.  The La Porte SMR is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nAir Liquide's La Porte SMR is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.  The flammability of some of the chemicals in the process makes it necessary for Air Liquide to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses some of the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n \nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and electronically that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all"
