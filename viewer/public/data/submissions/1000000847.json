Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Helena Chemical Company in Berne, Indiana are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Berne Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise, and the Adams County Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with one 12,000-gallon tank, five 1,500-gallon nurse tanks, six 1,250-gallon nurse tanks, and thirty-eight 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Berne, Indiana.  The maximum amount stored is 70,550 gallons (363,050.3 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility (the 18,000-gallon tank interconnected with the 12,000-gallon tank) contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n \n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is "

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nHelena Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHelena Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHelena Chemical Company conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Helena Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified of the modification and offered training to deal with it. \n\nPre-startup Reviews\nHelena Chemical Company routinely conducts "

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHelena Chemical Company conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHelena Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5. Five-year Accident History\nHelena Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Despite our stringent release prevention policies, a small accidental release occurred on May 6, 2004.  Due to a valve failure, 300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released, resulting in a 20-minute cloud.  The valve was replaced immediately, and an incident report was filed.  There were no deaths or injuries as a result of the incident.  No property damage or environmental damage occurred, and evacuation was not necessary.\n\n  6. Emergency Action Plan\nHelena Chemical Company maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Helena Chemical Company will contact local emergency response agencies and the public.
