The AES Warrior Run facility initiated operations in February 2000.\n\n\n\n    AES Warrior Run is a 180 megawatt coal-fired cogeneration power plant, which uses the Circulating Fluidizing Bed (CFB) technology.  It is located south of Cumberland, Maryland in Allegany  County.  The facility is situated off of Industrial Boulevard (State Route 51) on Mexico Farms Road, S.E. adjacent to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The area is sparsely populated and is shared with other industrial concerns.  The entire AES Warrior Run facility is fenced with one entrance to the facility, which is currently monitored by security on a 24 hour a day seven (7) days a week basis.\n\n\n\n    During the production of electricity, AES Warrior Run uses Anhydrous Ammonia in the facility's selective non-catalytic reduction unit (SNCR) for nitrogen oxide emission control.  Warrior Run stores the Anhydrous Ammonia in a 12,000 gallon tank, when filled to capacity the tank could hold 61, 200 pounds of Ammonia.  AES Warrior Run has placed an administrative filling limit on the tank of 75% which is 9,000 gallons or 45,900 pounds.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a documented accidental release prevention program for anhydrous ammonia. The program addresses all prevention program elements specified in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D and 29 CFR 1910.119.  Program elements ensure the safe design, operation and maintenance of the covered process, and include a management system to oversee the implementation of program elements. \n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nTo ensure personnel and public safety, AES Warrior Run maintains Emergency Action Plans/Procedures, including plans/procedures for addressing an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The Emergency Action Plan also has procedures for contacting and coordinating with local emergency response agencies (Allegany County Emergency Management Agency) in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nContinuous Safety Improvement\n\n\n\nThis facility improves safety performance by emphasizing all elements of the PSM/RMP program.  Recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and compliance audits are designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia process.  AES Warrior Run evaluates each recommendation in a timely manner and implements, as soon as possible, those recommendations that reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n"
