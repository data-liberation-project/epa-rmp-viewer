      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  Metropolitan provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by Metropolitan in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the previous century.  Metropolitan currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F. E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  Metropolitan regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, Metropolitan has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Weymouth Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected against accidental releases by chlorine vapor scrubbers.\n\nWeymouth Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operat"

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator room, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing the online storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated locally and at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each chlorine storage vessel liquid angle valve connected to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, including the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either chlorine storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

      "SummaryText": "2022, the PHA was revalidated and there were no additional recommendations proposed.\n\nThe January 2005 CalARP submittal included a seismic assessment of the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility which was updated in January 2010 and again in January 2015.  Metropolitan's January 2020 seismic assessment was completed following MOC construction of the new Chlorine System Upgrade at 60% and 90% completion, with the final report issued in October 2020.  Metropolitan's next seismic assessment will be completed in October 2025.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThere are written procedures at the Weymouth Plant to maintain up-to-date, accurate, and written procedures that provide clear instructions for operating the chlorine process.  The Weymouth Plant ensures effective operating and maintenance practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  The operating procedures include connection/disconnection for chlorine storage vessel, start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, after maintenance start-up for chlorine evaporators, maintenance shutdown for chlorine evaporators, start-up and shutdown for ejectors, start-up and shutdown for chlorinators, startup and shutdown for chlorine scrubber, chlorine system emergency shutdown, start-up following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  Also included are the maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to correct or avoid deviations.  Weymouth Plant updates procedures at least annually, or whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Updated operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining"

Weymouth Plant mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n-Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment. \n-Inspection and testing of process equipment, based on methods and frequency specified by equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and/or prior operating experience.\n-Detailed documentation of such inspections and tests on the process equipment.\n-Training of personnel who will be maintaining the process in the mechanical integrity program procedures, an overview of the process and its hazards, and safe work practices applicable to their job tasks.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \nWeymouth Plant requires employees to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the covered process.  Weymouth Plant uses a permitting program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near the chlorine process.\n\nWeymouth Plant has developed and implemented procedures to manage changes (except \"replacements in kind\") that affect the chlorine process.  These procedures allow Weymouth Plant to identify and review any potential hazards and provide additional training, procedures and safety, process, or chemical information before the proposed change is installed and implemented.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Weymouth Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program"

The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the audit's recommendations and suggestions. \n\nIncident Investigation\nWeymouth Plant investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could reasonably have resulted in) a catastrophic chlorine release - a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented and findings and recommendations are resolved.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed with all affected staff.  There have been no such incidents involving the Weymouth Plant chlorine system in the past five (5) years.\n\nThe Five-year Accident History Summary\nNo chlorine releases that caused or could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Weymouth Plant during the last five years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program Summary\nMetropolitan is currently a non-responding agency and, as such, does not have an emergency response plan.  Weymouth Plant has HAZWOPER-trained employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases.  Weymouth Plant also has employees trained to implement an Incident Command System.  If the accidental release requires an emergency response, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Weymouth Plant coordinates with such local response agencies (Los Angeles County Fire Department and La Verne City Fire) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Weymouth Plant chlorine system and its emergency response requirements and that the chlorine system is reflected in their Area Plans.

These recommended actions were evaluated and implemented as required.  The recommended actions to further improve the chlorine safety developed from the 2023 internal audit are being implemented and expected to be resolved in 2025."
