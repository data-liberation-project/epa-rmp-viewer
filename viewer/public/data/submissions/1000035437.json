      "SummaryText": "The Brazoria County Municipal Utility District No. 3 (BCMUD No. 3) Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine gas to disinfect the plant's effluent and sulfur dioxide gas to remove the chlorine from the effluent prior to its discharge to Marys Creek. The cylinders for both of these chemicals are stored outside, under cover in close proximity to the south entrance of the chemical feed room and are clearly identified as either empty or full.  Most of the time the on-premise stock of chlorine gas consists of two to three one-ton cylinders.  The sulfur dioxide gas cylinders stored on site usually consist of two one-ton cylinders.\r\n\r\nProtecting the plant personnel and the citizens of the Southwyck is a high priority.  Personnel at the plant receive training on the proper handling of the gases, procedures for changing the cylinders, and repairing leaks. Material Safety Data Sheets are kept on site for staff to refer to if the need should arise.  BCMUD No. 3 also has a preventive maintenance program, which provides for a longer working life for the equipment and insurance that the equipment is working properly on a daily basis.  The BCMUD No. 3 Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel have compiled an excellent safety record in regard to the use of and storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas.  In the long history of this process no reportable incidents have occurred. Plant personnel have achieved this record as a result of the safety procedures that are in place and the commitment of plant personnel.  Safety procedures are re-evaluated on a yearly basis.\r\n\r\nThe risk management plan requires BCMUD No. 3 to evaluate the potential effects of two hypothetical gas leak scenarios.  The first, worst case scenario, considers the impact of one one-ton chlorine cylinder discharging its entire contents to the atmosphere within a ten-minute time period.  The toxic endpoint represents the theoretical outmost boundary at which harm could result if the exposure to either of the gases occurr"

In this scenario plant personnel would follow the following operating procedure: \r\n\r\n1.  Call 911 to dispatch appropriate emergency units. \r\n2.  Plant personnel would determine the toxic endpoint based on leak characteristics \r\n3.  Emergency Units would begin evacuation of the area inside the toxic endpoint boundaries. \r\n4.  Plant personnel would determine the probability of safely stopping the leak. If they determined that the probability of fixing the leak was high: \r\n5.  A two-person trained leak repair crew would be established. \r\n6.  A two-person trained rescue crew would be established and placed at a safe distance from the leaking tank, but close enough to facilitate a successful rescue attempt if needed. \r\nIf a trained rescue and/or trained leak repair crew(s) cannot be established no attempt will be made to stop the leak and the tank would be allowed to empty. \r\n\r\nThe second scenario, alternative release scenario, considers a 1/16 inch diameter opening due to a pin-hole leak in the tubing.  The toxic endpoint for this scenario has been calculated to be 0.1 miles limiting the exposure to the Wastewater Treatment Plant and adjacent properties.  The operating procedures under this scenario are the same as under the worse case scenario."
