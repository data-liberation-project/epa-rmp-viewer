      "SummaryText": "Boasso America (Boasso) operates a transportation terminal located at 80 Doremus Ave in Newark, NJ which currently consists of Intermodal Tank Containers (ISO Containers) transportation operations. The transportation terminal provides temporary transportation storage and maintenance for ISO containers incidental to transportation to the final destination selected by the shipper.   ISOs are manufactured according to specifications from the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and are suitable for multiple transport methods such as truck, rail, or ship.  In-transit storage services are provided to a wide variety of clients and industries and the specific chemicals and inventory quantities onsite can vary. Temporary storage at the facility includes ISO's containing chemicals listed as Extraordinarily Hazardous Substances (EHS) as defined in New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) at, N.J.A.C. 7:31(which incorporates, by reference, the federal Chemical Accident Prevention rules at 40 CFR 68).  Onsite quantities of EHS may exceed applicable regulatory thresholds and, as such, the facility is subject to the requirements of TCPA.  To comply with TCPA, Boasso is required to prepare and implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to prevent and/or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release or explosion.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the threshold quantity includes substances in a \"covered process\", defined as use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or onsite movement operations that have an EHS present.  Facilities are subject to the requirements of TCPA if the total quantity of EHS in covered processes exceed the threshold limits specified in N.J.A.C. 7:31-6.  Temporary storage of ISO containers incidental to transportation that are not connected to motive power, which hold EHS constitutes a covered process as defined by TCPA.  \n\n\n\nWhile the term \"ISO\" can refer to a variety of transport containers meeting the ISO standard, the Boasso terminal in Newark ha"

Twenty-foot (20') long ISOs are brought to the facility on trailer chassis by over-the-road trucks.  ISOs may be empty and clean, empty (but sometimes containing de minimis amounts of chemicals that cannot be pumped out of the container during delivery), or full or almost full with chemical.  Boasso's RMP covers EHS-containing ISOs that are full or almost full.  ISOs are unloaded from the chassis by container handlers and are moved to an available temporary storage location onsite by the container handler or by a yard truck and trailer chassis.  Empty ISOs may be stacked up to three high and full ISO's may be stacked up to two high. Stacks may be several rows deep. While in storage, ISOs may be moved for access to other ISOs below or behind.  ISOs ready for shipment are loaded to trailer chassis by a container handler.  Prior to shipment, select ISOs may be heated using steam or hot water.\n\n\n\nThe covered process is limited to movement, storage and heating (as required) for EHS containing ISOs.  EHS are not removed from their ISOs or transferred, processed, or used in any other way at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has been developed to satisfy the requirements of TCPA (N.J.A.C. 7:31) and, incorporated by reference, the federal Chemical Accident Prevention rules at 40 CFR 68. The purpose of this RMP program is to identify the chemical and physical hazards associated with EHS present at the Boasso terminal and to describe the administrative and engineering controls that are in place to minimize the potential for exposure to workers, the public, and the environment.  It also describes the procedures and preventive actions to control operations involving EHS at this facility.  \n\n\n\nThe following toxic EHS have been identified as potentially "

Boasso operators do not respond to leak or spill events and are instructed to notify their emergency response contractor (Skytank) immediately.\n\nThere was an explosion and fire at the Facility on March 9, 2015 involving a full ISO containing isoprene. Based on the facility's investigation, a loaded ISO tank container of isoprene was brought into wash bay #2 at the tank wash building on March 9, 2015.  While inside, isoprene was released from the tank, entered the waste water collection system and was pumped into the on-site wastewater treatment system.  Once it was discovered that the tank container was loaded, it was removed from the bay. The Facility believes that the release of isoprene, combined with a subsequent ignition source of an unknown origin, caused the explosion and fire.  The tank wash operation is no longer performed at the site and is not included in this RMP submission.\n\n\n\nDesign of secondary containment to meet requirements of DPCC is currently under development.  Once finalized, the RMP will be modified to incorporate secondary containment.  Boasso will modify or amend this program when new processes that will handle EHS are planned to be performed onsite."
