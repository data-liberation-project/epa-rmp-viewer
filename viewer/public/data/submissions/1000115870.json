      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Teague Gas Plant is owned and operated by Hilcorp Energy Company.  The plant is located near Teague, Texas in Freestone County, Texas.  The plant is designed to process approximately 330MMscf/d of naturally occurring natural gas.  \nHilcorp employs approximately 10 full time employees and contractors at the facility.   \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nIt is the policy of Hilcorp Energy Company to conduct business in a responsible and ethical manner that protects the safety and health of employees and the public as well as protecting the environment. The Teague Plant Emergency Action Plan covers procedures for reporting fires or other emergencies, emergency evacuation and exit routes, procedures for employees who remain to operate critical plant operations prior to evacuation, accounting for personnel, rescue and medical duties, and contact information for employees responsible for plan implementation and who can provide more information to other employees about the plan.  \nThe Emergency Action Plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the facility coordinates routine drills and table top exercises with local emergency response personnel.   \n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nProcess 1 \u0096 Propane Refrigeration\nThe facility employs a gas chilling process utilizing a propane refrigeration system to supply cooling in the Gas Chiller as described in Process 2.  Threshold quantities of regulated flammable substances are present at the facility in Process 1, but no threshold quantities of regulated toxic substances are present at the facility.   Refrigerant grade propane flows from the Refrigerant Accumulator to the Refrigerant Economizer where vapors flash off at approximately 45psig.  These vapors are routed to an interstage port on the refrigeration compressor.  The propane liquid flows on level control to the inlet gas chiller where it is vaporized at approximately -35 deg. F.  The vaporizing propane provides cool"

The vapors from the suction scrubber are compressed to approximately 240psig in three of four, 1250 Hp motor driven screw compressors.  The vapor is then condensed at 120 deg. F in the refrigerant condenser and flows back to the refrigerant accumulator.  Bulk propane refrigerant for make-up is stored in the Refrigerant Storage tank which has a maximum allowable operating pressure of 250psig and a capacity of 12,000 gallons.  \nProcess 2 - Natural Gas Processing\nThe Teague Plant takes raw natural gas from the Hilcorp operated Trend Gathering System where the gas undergoes a variety of processes to deliver marketable Natural Gas, Natural Gas Liquids, and Natural Gas Condensate to market.   Threshold quantities of regulated flammable substances are present at the facility in Process 2, but no threshold quantities of regulated toxic substances are present at the facility. \nProduced natural gas and liquids enter the plant at an approximate design rate of 330MMCFD and at approximately 965psig. The gas flows through an MDEA (Methyl Diethanolamine) amine unit that removes CO2 and H2S from the gas stream.  Rich amine from the amine contactor is flashed in a flash vessel and the flash gas is be sent to the plant\u0092s fuel system to be used as fuel for various fired processes in the facility. The rich amine liquid flows to the amine regeneration unit where the CO2 and H2S are driven off with heat from the facility\u0092s hot oil system. The lean amine is then cooled and sent back to the amine contactor.  The resultant regenerator overhead vapor containing H2S and CO2 is sent to a caustic contact tower where a caustic solution (typically sodium hydroxide) absorbs the H2S and flows to a closed loop H2S biological treatment unit (Paques Plant). The H2S in the caustic stream will be aerobically reduced with specialized bacteria and the lean caustic will retur"

Spent biomass along with products of digestion from the Paques plant are disposed of.  \nWet, treated gas flows to a Gas Chiller where it is cooled to a design temperature of -32 deg. F for hydrocarbon liquid (NGL) recovery and to meet gas pipeline specifications.  Ethylene Glycol (EG) is injected into the wet gas stream upstream of the gas chiller to dehydrate the gas and prevent freezing in the chiller or associated piping/equipment.  The treated gas and EG mixture leaves the chiller and enters the Glycol Cold Separator where EG/Water (rich EG), liquid hydrocarbons (NGLs) and the dry gas are separated.  The treated, dry gas is then sent to residue compression where pressure is increased to deliver the gas to a downstream pipeline.  Cooling is achieved through a propane refrigeration system (described in Process 2).  \nThe rich EG is regenerated in an Ethylene Glycol Regeneration system where the water is driven off of the glycol with heat and the lean EG is recycled back to be injected into the treated gas stream.  Process heat is provided through a hot oil system.  \nNGLs extracted from the treated gas stream in the Glycol Cold Separator are then stabilized and sent to atmospheric storage tanks to be trucked for sales.  The stabilization process involves driving off the lighter end vapors using heat from the hot oil system.  The overhead vapors are compressed and recycled back to the plant inlet.  \n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES ABOVE THRESHOLD QUANTITIES AT TEAGUE PLANT\nThe Teague Plant maintains threshold quantities of refrigerant grade propane in Process 1.  The facility also maintains threshold quantities of flammable, naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane in Process 2.  \nHydrogen sulfide (H2S) is present in the gas stream, but not at the threshold quantity per \u00a7 68.130.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nProcess 1 - \nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) for P"
