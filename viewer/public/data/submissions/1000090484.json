      "SummaryText": "KAAPA Ethanol Ravenna Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nKAAPA Ethanol Ravenna, LLC (\"KAAPA Ravenna\") is a fuel-grade ethanol production plant with the capacity to produce approximately 138 million gallons per year (MMGal/yr) of denatured fuel-grade ethanol.  In addition, the facility produces corn oil and animal feed in the forms of Dried Distillers Grains and Solubles (DDGS) and Wet Distillers Grains and Solubles (WDGS). The basis for the production of ethanol is to convert the starch in corn to sugars and then convert the sugars to ethanol (i.e. grain alcohol).  The facility receives corn by truck inside the grain receiving buildings.  The corn is stored in bins prior to processing.  The corn is ground using four hammer mills and mechanically conveyed to the process area.  Water is then added to the milled corn to create slurry.  The slurry is heated, enzymes are added for liquefaction, and the resultant mash is cooled.  The mash is mixed with yeast and more enzymes in a fermenter.  After approximately 48 to 55 hours of fermentation the resultant liquid (beer) contains 11%-15% ethanol by weight.  The beer is distilled in a three-column distillation process; the resultant product is 95% ethanol and 5% water (190-proof) and whole stillage consisting of solids and water.  Using molecular sieves, the remaining 5% water is removed from the product resulting in 100% ethanol (200-proof).  The product is then combined with 2.1 - 2.5% natural gasoline (denaturant) and sold as 200-proof denatured ethanol.   \n\n\n\nKAAPA Ravenna stores denaturant in aboveground storage tanks (ASTs). The denaturant contains n-pentane, n-butane, isopentane, and neopentane which are subject to the Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. KAAPA Ravenna is currently subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. KAAPA Ravenna blends denaturant with ethanol at the facility loadout and does not store denatured ethano"

      "SummaryText": "l at the facility. Therefore, the RMP covered process consists of denaturant receiving and storage and denatured ethanol loadout. However, the facility has the ability to store blend stock and the ability to put any kind of product in any of the tanks; therefore, denatured ethanol and blend stock storage may occur at the facility in the future. If the facility stores denatured ethanol and/or blend stock, then denatured ethanol/blend stock storage would also be part of the RMP covered process and subject to RMP requirements, including process hazard analysis and management of change. For reference, blend stock is a blend of gasoline and ethanol with the composition of gasoline ranging from 0% to 100%; thus, the ethanol composition within blend stock would range from 0% to 100%.\n\n\n\n2.    Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nKAAPA Ravenna corporate policies place the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities. The owners, management and employees of the KAAPA Ravenna l facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hazardous materials. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Buffalo County Emergency Management (Local Emergency Planning Committee), and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n3.    Prevention Program under RMP\n\nKAAPA Ravenna implements RMP prevention program elements for its covered process, including, but not limited to: evaluating hazards, safely and properly operating covered process equipment, implementing an effective maintenance program, ensuring that workers and contractors are adequately trained, and ensuring that management of change and pre start-up safety procedures are implemented for changes to the covered process.\n\n\n\n4.    5-Year Accident History\n\nWhile spills have occurred, no significant or RMP-r"

      "SummaryText": "eportable accident has occurred in the past 5 years for the covered process. \n\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nKAAPA Ravenna maintains and implements an emergency action plan (EAP) that addresses spills that may occur from the RMP covered process. Spills and spill response are also addressed in KAAPA Ravenna's SPCC Plan. KAAPA Ravenna also coordinates emergency response and preparedness activities with the LEPC and the local fire department. Both employees and contractors are trained on emergency response procedures. Spill kits available for use for small spills, and denaturant receiving is conducted in a bermed area that provides containment in the event of a spill. Denaturant storage has secondary containment and if a spill occurs during rail loadout of denatured ethanol, then it would release into bulk storage secondary containment area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Safety Improvements\n\nAs a result of a recent PHA update and taking into account a spill that occurred recently, KAAPA Ravenna is in the process of evaluating updates to its standard operating procedures and is evaluating adding additional emergency stops that would prevent or minimize a spill.  KAAPA Ravenna periodically reviews industry best practices and uses root cause analysis after an incident to determine if additional preventive measures could be implemented to improve safety and minimize and/or mitigate releases.\n\n"
