      "SummaryText": "facturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  LSCP ethanol plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 4.4 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for denaturant is about 1.0 mile.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 102,420 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 4.4 mile radius.   The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 2,000,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 1.0 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 1.0 mile radius.\n\nAlthough LSCP Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The ARS is the release of 500,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the facility.  The ARS is the toxic release of 4,780 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.9 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within"

There have been no accidents that have resulted in a release of any RMP substances above the required reporting threshold, to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe LSCP ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An updated SPCC & FRP Plan (FRP portion of the plan is a new addition) will be prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  LSCP ethanol plant's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities"

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.\n\nLittle Sioux Corn Processors, L.P.  (LSCP) is a fully operational ethanol production facility.  LSCP started operations in March of 2003.  At that time, LSCP submitted and RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  As LSCP nears the end of their 5 year coverage, and the start up of the newly expanded facility, this RMP will cover the Marcus facility for another 5 year period.  A few of the reports and information have been changed or updated with the expansion.  LSCP has performed periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nLSCP has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nLSCP\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, four final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  LSCP has coordinated with the Marcus Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe LSCP ethanol plant is located in about two miles west of Marcus, Cherokee County, Iowa.  LSCP is located in the North \u00bd of the NE \u00bc, Section 2, Township 92 North, Range 42 West, bounded on the North by 480th Street, east by F Ave., west by undeveloped land and south by a rail line.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manu"
