      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nChief Wenatchee, Inc. - Malott facility (hereafter referred to as Chief Wenatchee-Malott) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Chief Wenatchee-Malott to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nChief Wenatchee-Malott's personnel do not respond to ammonia releases.  The emergency plan requires employees to call 9-1-1 and evacuate the plant in the event of an ammonia release.  \n\nAt Chief Wenatchee-Malott anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n7 Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n7 Reduce the threat to our personnel\n7 Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nChief Wenatchee-Malott is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 226 B&O Road, Malott, Washington, in Okanogan County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Chief Wenatchee-Malott is anhydrous ammonia \n(CAS# 7664-41-7). The anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 14,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the entire system.\n\nChief Wenatchee-Malott uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they are not listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, Chief Wenatchee-Malott believes in the concept set forth in the \"General Duty Clause\" of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, Chief Wenatchee-Malott has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n C. Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios.  The"

      "SummaryText": " worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released \".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel, filled to 100% capacity, would release 4,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room; its walls are in direct contact with the outside.  Although the release scenario would occur inside a building, enclosure mitigation was not taken into account in the modeling of this release. \n\nFor the purpose of this worst-case scenario, it was assumed that all 14,000 pounds of ammonia were released in a 10-minute period.  Under this assumption the distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 2.2 miles.  The \"risk radius\" extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptor areas. Distance was determined by use of RMP-COMP.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Several alternative scenarios were modeled, using ALOHA, version 5.2.1, however a release from the bottom (liquid space) of the receiver, under normal operating conditions, was chosen.  This alternative scenario provided the greatest risk radius, 1,100 yards. No mitigation factors were taken into account in the modeling of this scenario.  \n\nBoth the worst-case and alternate scenarios are unlikely.  A more realistic release scenario would be a vapor release from a pressure relief valve (PRV) lifting.  These are located on top of the buildings, at a height of approximately 40 feet.  In the event a PRV scenario which would involve the loss of the entire system inventory (14,000 pounds) over a 30-minute period, the end-point distance would be 850 yards. (As modeled by ALOHA)\n\nD.
