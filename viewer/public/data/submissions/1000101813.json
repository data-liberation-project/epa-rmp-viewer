Refer to Section 7 of the RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the facility's OSHA PSM program. \n\nRMP FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo RMP related accidents have occurred in the past 5 years.  \n\nRESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe facility maintains a written Facility Response Plan (FRP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.  Any changes are administered through the MOC process, which include informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe facility coordinates activities with the Calhoun County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee with local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.   The facility has around-the-clock communication capabilities with appropriate Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) to facilitate notification of the public and receive a quick response.  \n\nTypes of RMP site-specific prevention steps include the following:\n\n-\tRelease detection (e.g., process alarms, LEL monitors); and\n-\tRelease containment and control (e.g., process relief valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment, check valves, and interlocks).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe facility resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which may result i"
