The Branch Manger is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\r\n\r\n1. Update emergency shutdown section of operating procedures to include specific references to valves and couplings\r\n2. Evaluate potential to install emergency shutoff at risers\r\n3. Evaluate potential to install emergency shutoff at the office\r\n4. Evaluate establishing written procedures regarding off-hour deliveries and key access for ammonia delivery contractors.\r\n5. Install fire extinguisher in the storage tank area\r\n6. Obtain procedure from suppliers making deliveries to ensure that drivers are checking transfer hose for compatibility\r\n7. Update RMP operating procedures to make reference to color coding for liquid and vapor lines\r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses.

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific release prevention steps implemented at the site include the use of excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tank for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Sedgwick Country Fire Department (fire department) regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.

There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tank into nurse tanks owned by Wilbur-Ellis and operated by local farmers for the application of ammonia fertilizer to the farmers' fields.  A maximum of 29 nurse tanks (1,000 gallons each) may be stored at the facility at a given time.
