Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nSysco New Mexico, LLC is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  If such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Albuquerque Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 16,981 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA's Clean Air Act.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to insure that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in enginee"
