RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nIt is the goal and principle of our business to manage process safety systems as a means to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of process contents.  Effective process safety management will contribute to the prevention of acute process and equipment failures with the consequent prevention of the effects of such failures.\n\n\n\nProper performance of the procedures outlined in the risk management program is intended to satisfy our commitment of Environmental, Health, and Safety responsibility to the public, our employees, customers and all those who are stakeholders in our business endeavors.  Further, applicable laws and regulations will be satisfied.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) was integrated into the facility Process Safety Management System, which applies to all covered processes at the ADPP (U.S.) Mill Hall facility.  The goals of this Process Safety Management (PSM) System will be achieved through implementation of the procedures outlined in the Chapters of this PSM Manual:\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Employee Participation\n\nChapter 3: Operating Procedures\n\nChapter 4: Training\n\nChapter 5: Contractors\n\nChapter 6: Process Safety Review\n\nChapter 7: Mechanical Integrity\n\nChapter 8: Hot Work Permits\n\nChapter 9: Managing Change\n\nChapter 10: Incident Investigation\n\nChapter 11: Emergency Planning and Response\n\nChapter 12: Process Safety Information\n\nChapter 13: Process Hazard Analysis\n\nChapter 14: Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) Council, under the Direction of the PSM Coordinator, is responsible for the overall management of the PSM manual.  The PSM Coordinator is responsible for ensuring implementation of the procedures outlined in the PSM manual.  The Plant Manager is responsible for ensuring that adequate resources are available to implement the procedures outlined in the PSM manual.  The Health and Safety is responsible for inspecting the PSM Management System annually.\n\n"

FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nAvery Dennison Performance Polymers (ADPP) manufactures pressure-sensitive adhesives that are used in label and tape applications.  The facility employs approximately 110 employees.  The facility produces adhesives through batch polymerization of monomers in either water-based or solvent-based systems.  An important chemical used in this process is vinyl acetate, which is regulated by the RMP regulation.  Vinyl acetate is stored in two interconnected storage tanks at the facility (maximum 140,000 pounds) and is used in all reactor systems at the facility.  Vinyl acetate is the only chemical at the facility subject to the RMP regulation.  \n\n\n\n3. WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely the scenario in this document will occur, as EPA regulation defines worst-case and alternative scenarios without regard to their likelihood.  To limit the potential for accident, vinyl acetate is always shipped containing a polymerization inhibitor.  Properly inhibited, vinyl acetate is stable under recommended storage conditions.  At this facility, vinyl acetate is stored out of direct sunlight, under cover, in two diked tanks.  The tanks are positioned on electronic scales and any potential leak will be detected through automated high level alarms within the dike.  The piping system is double walled "

The storage, handling, and use of this chemical at the facility greatly limits the potential for accidental release.  \n\n\n\nThe facility worst-case scenario and alternative scenarios were originally presented to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in March 1998.  \n\n\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  An outline of the facility program is listed in section 1 of this summary.\n\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis facility has had no accidental release that contained vinyl acetate in the last five years.  \n\n\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis facility maintains a written emergency response plan and conducts regular drills and training for facility response personnel.  Presently the response team has eleven members trained to the HAZMAT technician level.  A full inventory of emergency equipment is maintained at the facility.  The facility plans are coordinated with the emergency response plans of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the local fire department and the county hazardous materials response team.\n\n\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThis facility follows a policy of continuous improvement in the area of risk management and process safety management.  The facility is in the process of implementation of the Responsible Care Process Safety Code and Product Safety Code."
