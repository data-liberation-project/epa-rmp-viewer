General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nUPE will take all steps necessary to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place for the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUPE will maintain a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (see Appendix A ? SDS, DOT 112 Rail Car Spec).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA hazard analysis was completed as part of this Plan. Major hazards identified include fire and explosion. Process controls include the following:\n\n?    Railcar construction that is resistant to puncture and heat;\n\n?    Locked protective housings over all valves and fittings to discourage unauthorized access;\n\n?    Pressure relief valves to prevent tank over-pressuring; and,\n\n?    Safety check valves to limit flow rate and prevent uncontrolled release of tank contents to atmosphere.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nUPE will maintain written operating procedures to ensure that activities within the covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures will address various modes of operation. The information will be regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (see Appendix B ? Operating Procedures).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nUPE depends on RVTRC to safely deliver tank cars into storage, secure them against unwanted movement, protect them from collisions, and remove them from storage. RVTRC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that their employees involved in these processes are trained to an adequate level of competency.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUPE relies on the Tank Car Supplier, the manufacturer and owner of the rail cars leased by UPE to conduct maintenance and testing that assures mechanical integrity. UPE requires that any cars leased from the Tank Car Supplier are maintained in accordance with applicable regulatory and industry standards (e.g., 49 CFR Part 180 Subpart F ? Qualification and Maintenance of Tank Cars, and Association of American Railroads Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices, Section C-III, Specifications for Tank Cars). The Tank Car Supplier maintains detailed maintenance records.\n\n\n\nThe Tank Car Supplier performs inspections at a frequency of at least every 10 years. Where manufacturers of valves and fittings recommend a shorter inspection interval, the Tank Car Supplier follows the manufacturers recommendation. Inspections and testing include bubble leak tests, ultrasonic testing of weld seams, thickness gaging, heat testing, and bench testing of valves prior to installation and at the manufacturer-recommended frequency.\n\n\n\nUPE also performs, or causes to be performed, inspections to ensure tank cars have been delivered secure and leak-free. Visual inspections are performed to confirm cable seals and/or padlocks are present and intact on the protective housing covering valves and fittings. A gas detector is used to confirm the absence of leakage from valves and fittings. Security and leak inspections are typically performed within seven (7) days of railcar delivery (see Appendix C - Maintenance).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nNo process changes are reasonably anticipated.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup review is limited to ensuring the rail siding is in serviceable condition. RVTRC is responsible for maintaining its track and associated infrastructure in accordance with its rail maintenance program. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nIf UPE operates the facility for more than one (1) year, it will ensure compliance reviews are completed at least every three (3) years as required by 40 CFR 68.58.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nUPE understands that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. UPE encourages its employees to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. Although UPE will not have any employees directly involved in the processes covered under this Plan, UPE expects its partners, RVTRC and the Tank Car Supplier, to similarly foster a proactive safety culture within their organizations. In addition, UPE will ensure that RVTRC and its employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUPE will conduct incident investigations as required by 40 CFR 68.60 for incidents that resulted in a catastrophic release or that could have resulted in a catastrophic release.\n\n",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRogue Valley Terminal Railroad Corporation (RVTRC) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of RVTRC's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes.  It is RVTRC's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. These controls include employee training, equipment inspections, and ambient air monitoring.  In the context of this Risk Management Plan, storage of rail tank cars loaded with propane in the form of liquified petroleum gas is the only process that occurs at the facility. RVTRC depends upon and coordinates with RVTRC, the Jackson County Fire District No. 3, and the Jackson County Emergency Management to provide emergency response and response expertise.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility's primary activity is receiving, storage, and shipping Propane as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in railcars. Railcars are placed on a rail siding, secured against unwanted movement and protected from collision with other cars/trains, stored for up to one (1) year, then transported to customers in California. Each 33,000-gallon capacity railcar contains up to 160,380 pounds of propane. Up to 125 rail cars may be stored on site; therefore, the maximum amount of propane stored at the facility is 20,047,500 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \n\nRMP*Comp was utilized to evaluate worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required off-site consequence analysis for the facility. Scenario details are included in Section 4 of this Plan and summarized below. Several factors prot"

These DOT 112 tank cars are constructed from 0.6-inch fusion welded high tensile steel, jacketed for thermal protection, and have an outer steel skin. Testing performed by the Federal Railroad Administration (RR 14-30, August 2014) indicate they can withstand 2.1 million foot-pounds of impact energy from a one (1) ft2 ram. Tank cars will be protected from unintentional movement and collision by setting handbrakes on parked cars and by locking out switches. Valves and fittings on each tank car are located under a protective steel housing on the top center of the tank. A pressure relief valve prevents over-pressuring, and a safety check valve limits the flow rate from the loading/unloading valve. Reasonable release scenarios are limited to a malfunctioning valve(s) or fitting(s), or intentional release by partially opening the loading/unloading valve such that flow would not trigger the safety check valve.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of all tank cars stored at the facility (28,868,400 pounds) and ignition of the resulting vapor cloud. Administrative controls or mitigation that would affect the release rate were not included in this scenario. At Stability Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and air temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), the maximum distance to an endpoint of one (1) pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure (endpoint fixed by regulation) is 2.5 miles (Figure 1). A census search of population within a 2.5-mile radius using CensusViewer reports 6,163 persons (2010 census).\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of one (1) tank car. In the alternative scenario, 127,500 pounds of propane is released and the resulting vapor cloud ignited. The release is assumed to be undetected while ongoing and at a rate that does n"

The railcars will be secured against unwanted movement in accordance with RVTRC's Air Brake and Train Handling Rules. At a minimum, hand brakes will be set on an adequate number of rail cars to prevent movement. Other measures to prevent unwanted railcar movement (e.g., rail clamping wheel blocks, chocks, car stops, bump posts) may be used, as needed. When not open to receive tank cars into storage, rail switches will be locked to prevent unwanted movement of cars or trains onto the siding.\n\n\n\n?    Normal operations. Normal operation consists of railcar storage on a leased rail siding. Tank cars will be inspected periodically to ensure that the protective housing over the valves and fittings is secured with a cable seal and/or padlock(s), and that valves/fittings are not leaking. Tank cars will be initially inspected within seven (7) days of delivery. Any leaks, evidence of tampering, or other safety or security concerns noted during inspection will be immediately communicated to RVTRC.\n\n\n\n?    Temporary operations. This is not applicable.\n\n\n\n?    Emergency shutdown and operations. In the event of an emergency, local emergency services will be notified via the Jackson County, Oregon 9-1-1 system. Additional notifications will be made to RVTRC's 24-hr emergency number. Only if it is safe to do so, steps will be taken to minimize the threat (e.g., closing open valves). Otherwise, the facility will be evacuated, and personnel will await instructions from emergency responders.\n\n\n\nEmergency contact numbers are stated below:\n\nEmergency Contacts    Emergency\n\nNumber    Non-Emergency\n\nNumber\n\nJackson County Sheriff's Office    9-1-1    (541) 776-7206\n\nJackson County Emergency Management    9-1-1    (541) 774-6035\n\nJackson Co.
