The Safety Director is responsible for the overall development, administration and supervision of activities required by OSHA, EPA, DOT and other federal and state agencies, to safeguard all BGMU employees.  There are Safety Officers at the Treatment Plants, with their primary job consisting in Plant Operations and then secondary as Safety, in which they coordinate all inspections, safety equipment and employee assistance in safety at the Treatment Plants.\nPROGRAM ADMINISTRATION\nBowling Green Municipal Utilities on April 27, 1989 hired a full-time Safety Director so that BGMU could develop and implement a written Safety Program.  With the hiring be completed, the major obstacle was achieving compliance in the OSHA, EPA and DOT regulations so that BGMU and all the employees would have a safe and healthful work environment.  To this date the Safety Department now handles all of the compliance programs in the Electric, Water and Sewer Divisions, with the only exception being environmental issues that directly involve the Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Program, which the Industrial Pretreatment Director handles.  Bowling Green Municipal Utilities initialized a Safety Committee on October 26, 1994 starting with a member from each work area for a total of 10 members.  This committee makes its recommendations for health and safety issues that include investigations of injuries/accidents.  Bowling Green Municipal Utilities insures that each employee upon being hired is issued an employee handbook, in which this book explains many benefits, employment rules, insurance plans, work hours and policies.\n\nOn March 3, 2008 Bowling Green Municipal Utilities hired a Safety Coordinator to assist the Safety Director with all health and safety issues within the company.\n\nTRAINING\nBowling Green Municipal Utilities Safety Department de"

BGMU is committed to each employee by providing the employee with certain safety equipment, with a brief list of: safety glasses, hard hats, rain gear, hearing protection, respiratory protection, fall arresting equipment, etc.  The Safety Department is constantly reviewing each job function (Hazard Assessment), to ensure that all aspects of health and safety are being provided to BGMU employees.\nREPORTING INJURIES\nBowling Green Municipal Utilities is committed to employee health and safety, but due to working conditions that sometimes cannot be controlled, accidents occur.  If you should suffer any work-related injury, no matter how minor, it shall be reported to your supervisor immediately.

The Commonwealth of Kentucky mandates the use of chlorine in Public Water Supplies.  Chlorine is used as a primary and secondary disinfectant at the water treatment plant.  It is used as the primary disinfectant at the wastewater treatment plant.  The average amount of chlorine used is 550 pounds per day at the water treatment plant and 125 pounds per day at the wastewater treatment plant.\n\n  The feed system consists of five (5) W & T V-Notch type chlorinators at the water treatment plant and two (2) W & T V-Notch chlorinators at the wastewater treatment plant.  During normal operation, ten (10) cylinders (1 ton each) are connected in parallel to the manifold system at the water treatment plant with two (2) cylinders (1 ton each) connected at the wastewater treatment plant.  The manifolds are a split type with automatic switchover systems allowing selected amounts of cylinders to be used at a given time.\n\n  Storage room capacity at the water treatment is sixteen  (1 ton cylinders) and six (1 ton cylinders) at the wastewater treatment plant.  Normal operation would be three (3) cylinders in service with three (3) cylinders ready to switch over for use at the water treatment plant.  Normal operation at the wastewater treatment plant would be two (2) cylinders in service with four (4) cylinders in storage.  All stored cylinders are mounted on c"

Decisions must be made which will minimize the amount of chlorine that is released while at the same time having others provide warning or rescue to persons who are in danger.\n\n  Normal work clothing will provide all the protection that is required for the period of time it takes to escape from an emergency.  Such clothing, in combination with SCBA respiratory equipment, can be satisfactory for very brief periods required for rescue or valve closing.\n\n  Extended exposure to chlorine gas will be handled by the Bowling Green Fire Department and their performance of essential duties will be performed by their Standard Operating Procedures which will be handled by their Incident Commander.\n\n  Judgment must be used when high concentrations of chlorine gas or prolonged exposure is required or when persons may not have the option of moving out of the chlorine gas.  When the maximum level of protections will have to be used, the Bowling Green Fire Department will make a determination.  They have been specifically and recently trained in the use and limitations of such equipment.\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAZ MAT ACTIVATION\n\n\nThe activation of the Bowling Green Fire Department HAZMAT Team is necessary in the event of the release or spill of a chlorine leak or other chemicals in quantities which result in contaminant levels reaching a point where Level A personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used.  When a Chlorine leak occurs and the chlorine monitor reads 25ppm or greater outside or inside door, and the leak cannot be controlled the BGFD will be contacted.\n\nIt is the responsibility o"
