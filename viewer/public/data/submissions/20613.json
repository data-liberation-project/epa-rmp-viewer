      "SummaryText": "regulated substances handled\n\nThe Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant processes fully refined paraffin and micro crystalline waxes from various petroleum distillate feed stocks. Feed stocks are shipped into the facility via tank trucks and rail cars. Finished products are shipped from the site via the same method. The plant has approximately 133 employees and operates 24 hours per day. There are two chemicals at the Farmers Valley plant that are subject to the RMP regulation: anhydrous ammonia and propane. \nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. The ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool the charge stock to the Deoiling Unit. The normal maximum inventory of ammonia is 19,000 pounds.\nPropane is also a colorless gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure, it is a flammable chemical with a vapor density of 1.52 (air = 1). The propane is used as a solvent to remove heavy resin from vacuum tower bottoms. The maximum intended inventory of propane is 183,845 pounds.\n\n\n3. Worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the Farmers Valley plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of each chemical covered by the RMP regulation. EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure. EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate. In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions. For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.\nThe Farmers Valley plant is also required to analyze the impact of alternative accidental release scenarios.\n At the Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant the two chemicals which are currently subject to the RMP rule are anhydrous ammonia and propane. Ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical under the RMP rule and propane is classified as a"

The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant.  The procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy.\n\nSpecific information and instructions covered by the operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems.  Written procedures are also provided for specific operations such as hot work, lock-out/tag-out, confined space entry and line breaking.\n\n4d. Training\n\nEmployees currently engaged in operating processes involving ammonia and propane have received training to ensure they have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the requirements specified in the written operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided every three years at a minimum, or sooner if warranted by changes to operating conditions, equipment or procedures.  If refresher training is required more frequently than every three years, it would be triggered through the Management of Change process (described below).  Training records are maintained for each employee to show the date training was conducted, the material covered by the training, and the means used to verify that the training was understood.\n\n4e. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Honeywell Farmers Valley Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of equipment used to process and handle ammonia and propane.

      "SummaryText": "flammable.\n  \nWorst Case Scenarios\na)The worst case scenario for ammonia involves the failure of an ammonia storage tank containing 6,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, assuming the vessel is filled to its capacity. The anhydrous ammonia is released as a gas to the atmosphere. The plant is located in a lightly populated area and the cloud formed by the escaping ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. \n\nb)The worst case scenario for propane involves the failure of a propane storage tank containing 92,500 pounds of propane, assuming the vessel is filled to its capacity. The entire contents of the propane tank are assumed to be released instantaneously as a vapor and be detonated, thereby giving rise to a pressure wave. Again, this scenario would affect a lightly populated area.\n  \nAlternative Release Scenarios\na)The alternative release scenario considered for anhydrous ammonia would involve the failure of a transfer hose being used to offload a tank truck of ammonia. The excess flow valve on the truck would automatically close and limit the amount of ammonia released. This release of ammonia would have an offsite impact.\n\nb)The alternative release scenario considered for propane involves a release of propane through a split in a transfer hose connected to a tank truck. The release is in the form of a two-phase jet of vapor and liquid aerosol that is assumed to remain airborne. The flammable mass within the jet is assumed to detonate, thereby giving rise to a pressure wave. \n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe general, accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Farmers Valley plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.\n  \n4a.
