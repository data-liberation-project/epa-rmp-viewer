      "SummaryText": "TOXIC SUBSTANCE\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified and reported in the Risk Management Plan for the ammonia refrigeration process is a release from a failure of a flange on the discharge side of the pump (spiral accumulator pump). This alternative scenario is a scenario that Odom's considers possible at this site.\nIt was chosen because a release of this type is the alternative scenario identified that would most likely occur and the scenario that would lead to the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint.  A failure in the flange would most likely result from corrosion and deterioration of the piping material, not from external impact (the flanges at this location are not in traffic areas); therefore a complete shear of the piping is not considered a likely event.  Instead a hole (created from corrosion and deterioration) with a diameter one \nquarter of inch (cross-sectional area = .05 in2) is used to calculate the release.  The pump capacity is normally operating at 28 gallons per minute (159.36 lb./min) and the operational pipe pressure is approximately 60 psi.  \n\nThis release occurs outside with no passive mitigation present.  The estimated release duration was determined to be approximately 1 hour.  The topography is urban surroundings.  A wind speed of 3 meters/second, a stability class D and an air temperature of 77 degrees F are assumed for alternative release scenarios utilizing the RMP* Comp software analysis program.\n\nUsing these parameters it was determined (using EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance tables) that with an ammonia release from a leak at a flange over a period of one hour, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 0.1 miles or 528 feet.\n\nAlthough this scenario could occur, preventative maintenance, scheduled inspections of the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration process and continuous monitoring by Odom's ammonia system operator's help to identify and reduce the risk of this scenario from occurring.  \n\nACC"

The Process Safety Management Plan is a comprehensive program with fourteen elements, including process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, pre-safety startup, contractor safety, emergency planning and \nresponse, compliance auditing, and employee participation.  The Process Safety Management Program ensures that the processes and the equipment in the processes are designed, constructed, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and that the processes are operating according to good engineering practices.  The mechanical integrity element of the program includes scheduled \ninspections and tests of equipment and of monitoring devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment.  Preventative maintenance and replacement policies of parts and equipment ensures that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a \nrelease incident.   All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to ensure an uncontrolled release of carbon disulfide is prevented.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have occurred at Odom's in the past five years that has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nOdom's has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38) that includes provisions to evacuate employees from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical.   It is Odom's policy to contact the local emergency planning committee, and the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. Odom's has coordinated with the"

(Odom's) Madison, Tennessee facility packages raw pork products and produces gravy products for distribution to private and commercial industries.

The maximum ammonia inventory at Odom's is eleven thousand seven hundred fifty-seven pounds (11,757).   Ammonia is utilized at Odom's as a refrigerant to cool the building and freezers. \n\nOdom's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by Odom's Process Safety Management Program which includes operating procedures, mechanical integrity, inspection and testing of equipment to ensure releases are eliminated or minimized to an amount that will not affect employees \nor the surrounding community.\n\nThe emergency response program includes provisions for evacuation of employees at the facility and notification of local emergency agencies .  The LEPC will provide notification to any potentially affected surrounding communities in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Odom's adheres to all applicable Federal, State and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of this chemical.\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO:\n\nA worst-case scenario analysis was conducted for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process at Odom's utilizing requirements contained in EPA guidelines.
