All engineers are trained in the use of this equipment as an enhanced way of personnel rescue, release response and rapid control.\n\nRESPONSE ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE.\n\nUpon initial discovery of a leak or release, whether by sensor and alarm or personnel, a rapid and decisive response is critical to minimizing the potential impacts to off site populations and other sensitive areas.  As noted above, on site control and mitigation, along with personnel evacuation and accountability, is coupled with a rapid notification plan to bring in local and state agencies for assistance in the event the local population may potentially be affected."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION.\n\nThe main operation at New Orleans Cold Storage is the warehousing and distribution of frozen bulk foodstuff.  The facility consists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system.  Two additional blast units are used to maintain designated areas at very low temperatures ( 30 degrees F.)\n\nAll refrigeration units utilize Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system coolant.  At this facility, all systems are independent.  The main system is the unit subject to the Risk Management Program Requirements.\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive environmental areas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a corrosive irritant to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with skin will freeze the tissue, then produce a caustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered secondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is defined as the concentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse effects.  However, aggravation of existing respiratory and skin diseases may occur at concentrations below the toxic endpoint.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO CONTROL THE HAZARDS\n\nAlthough the release of all the Anhydrous Ammonia  within a 10 minute period (considering a catastrophic failure of the main receiver) is extremely unlikely, these are the parameters used in the worst case scenario.  In this case, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 1.0 miles.  Based on an interpretation of the USGS map, it is estimated that a maximum of 1,000 people reside within the vulnerable zone.  \n\nThe alternative scenario is based on an actual incident at another facility at which approximately 2,500 pou"

Within this distance, the residential population is essentially zero.  \n\nThere are no designated environmental management areas within the worst case vulnerable zone, however, Philbin Creek and associated marshlands are located to the South of the facility within the vulnerable zone.\n\nEXPLANATION OF HOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED.\n\nThe primary mitigation system for this facility is the Engine Room enclosure.  Although a catastrophic release would have ample opportunity to be vented to the atmosphere, the engine room enclosure would provide a significant degree of isolation in the more likely release scenario.   An active countermeasure to any leaks or releases is the ammonia sensors in the engine room and cold storage rooms.  If ammonia is detected, an audible alarm is immediately sounded within the warehouse and an alert is sent to a 24 hour/day monitoring service.\n\nOther process controls include automatic cut off devices in the event of deviation from prescribed limits (pressure, temperature, process level, etc.), check valves and relief valves.\n\n\nTo further reduce the likelihood of an accidental release, an extensive inspection program has been established for all system components and operating parameters.  This includes a daily inspection of compressors, pumps and associated equipment, and a weekly, monthly and annual inspection and maintenance schedule that is rigidly followed, ensuring a well maintained physical plant.\n\nAll operating procedures have been recently reviewed/revised and all personnel responsible for the proper operation of the refrigeration units have received refresher training in the procedures.  These elements of this program will further reduce the possibility of an accidental release caused by human error.\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS HAZARDS.\n\nThe primary methods for generating recommendations are through periodic review and/or revision of Pro"
