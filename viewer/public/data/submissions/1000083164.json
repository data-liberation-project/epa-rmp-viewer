At that time, Occidental sold its Durez Division to Sumitomo Bakelite who founded Durez Corporation.  Durez Corporation owns and operates a phenolic resin manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, NY.  The facility is located at 5000 Packard Road.  The facility was originally constructed in 1928 and operated under the Varcum name.  Reichold Chemical operated the facility to until 1984.  BTL Industries operated the facility from 1984 to 1989, at which time it was sold to Occidental Chemical and became part of their Durez Division.  The facility currently employs 62 employees.\n\n\n\n1.    The Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (68.155[a])\n\n\n\nDurez Corporation is committed to operating its Niagara Falls facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, industry standards and typical best management practices.  As part of this commitment, Durez has continued the same programs established by OxyChem to help ensure safe operation of the phenolic resin processes at this facility including the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Niagara Falls facility and that complies with the requirements of the EPA's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  This document provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program at the Niagara Falls facility.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Niagara Falls facility consists of the following three elements:\n\n\n\n* A hazard assessment to help understand a) the potential of off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and b) accidents that have occurred d"

The plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\n\n\nDurez limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance, the material must be reviewed by the plant chemist, production/operations manager, and the environmental, health and safety leader(s) (EH&S).  The review includes environmental, health and safety impacts, compatibility to materials of construction in the plant, and review of usage potential.  If all managers approve the usage of the hazardous substance, the facility's management of change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures are followed to track it through the facility.\n\n\n\nDurez strives to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  Durez has and will continue to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  Some key controls are:\n\n\n\n* In late 1999, Durez spent approximately $1.5MM to install a computer based monitoring system on all of its phenolic resin reactors.  This system monitors all aspects of the process cycle such as raw material charging, reaction temperature, pressure, vacuum, condition of auxiliary equipm"

The U.S. Census indicates that 50 people live within this distance from the location of the tank.  The only environmental receptor located within this distance is a small, isolated wetland.\n\n\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" for the formalin system is a failed gasket or weld at the pressurized formalin loop and the leaking of 3,390 pounds of formaldehyde in a 45% solution (64 pounds of formaldehyde vapor) to the asphalt or concrete surface below over a 30 minute period.

Propane is stored on site in 30 pound cylinders; however, the total quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (68.155[d])\n\n\n\nSince 1994, the Niagara Falls plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.\n\n\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA's PSM program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the fence line,\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Niagara Falls plant's Program 3 Prevention Program that addresses EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Niagara Falls plant's Program 3 Prevention Program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n4.1.1  Process Safety Information (? 68.65)\n\n\n\nThe Niagara Falls plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.  These documents address 1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, 2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and 3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  The plant ensures that this process safety information is available to all emp"

A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience, maintenance and process operators from the covered area, and a leader with process hazard analysis experience was assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the \"what if checklist\" technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepared a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Operating Procedures (? 68.69)\n\n\n\nNiagara Falls plant process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures 1) are used to train employees and 2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\n\n* Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n* Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n\n* Procedures for safe work practices such as Lock, Tag and Try; Hot Work; Confined Space Entry; and Line Breaking\n\n* Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\n\n\nPlant personn"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers 1) a general overview of the process, 2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and 3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.  The operators are consulted at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Mechanical Integrity (? 68.73)\n\n\n\nThe Niagara Falls plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes 1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and 2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant?s processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes:\n\n\n\n* Specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\n\n* Specifications for replacement parts and equipment\n\n* Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\n\n* Training of maintenance personnel\n\n* Documentation of maintenance activities\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Mana"
