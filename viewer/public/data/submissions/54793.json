      "SummaryText": "Munson Agri-Services RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description:\nMunson Agri-Services is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies. The facility was purchased from The Andersons in the spring of 2005. The facility manager and Vice President is Keith Krobath.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 2.5 acres and is situated just north of the village of Munson in Medina Township, Lenawee County. The facility is located on the east side of Munson Highway, north of Lawrence Street and south of the Norfolk Southern Railroad Line. There is one residence to the south of the facility, about 30 yards away. There are no adjacent neighbors to the east. There are a couple of homes on the north, about .25 miles away. To the southwest, there are 15 houses and one church within 500 yards of the facility.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. A 16,500 gallon tank and a 30,000 gallon tank are used for bulk storage of the material. These tanks are located approximately 50 feet and 65 feet, respectively, south of the railroad main line on the east side of the facility. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, these tanks can hold 203,554 total pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure. It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard. Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body. However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular. Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards:\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a railcar or delivery truck to the bulk storage ta"

Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed. All transfers of ammonia are observed by Agri-Services personnel.\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled. Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tanks can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s).  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved. These ?events? are very short in duration ? a few seconds at the most. \nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely. The bulk storage tanks are built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code. The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks are protected by concrete traffic barriers. All welding and structural work done on the tanks are performed by certified welders.\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented:\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input. Passive mitigation systems in place at Munson Agri-Services are: Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a railcar or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point. At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input"

      "SummaryText": " to function. Active mitigation systems in place at Munson are: Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank. They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate. They won?t reopen until the downstream shutoff valves are closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat. Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly. Back check valves are located on the railcar / truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only. This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a railcar or truck from the storage tank. Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great. This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling. They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure. Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump. This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve. An ample amount of water is available near the bulk storage tanks from 10,000 gallon and 15,000 gallon water tanks. A nearby water well (120? away) could be utilized to proved water to knock down a vapor cloud. Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers. Agri-Services personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank.\nPrevention Program:\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility?s hazard management program. All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the spring and fal"

Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or related equipment are also on file.\nThis facility uses Paul Akers, Inc. an Indianapolis, Indiana firm, for welding and major maintenance performed on the tank. The last complete inspection of the tank and piping was the winter of 2002. A full scale anhydrous ammonia audit was also performed at this time. Copies of all reports are on file.\nSee ?Steps Taken to Address Hazards? for more information on prevention measures and identification. \nManagement System ? See ?Steps taken to address hazards?\nEquipment Maintenance\nAll equipment maintenance is formally documented.

Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility. \nContractors\nAll contractors receive a contractor safety review prior to performing work at the facility. During this review, they are informed of any potential hazards at the facility, emergency procedures, site-specific safety rules and the ability to request an MSDS for any product at any time.\n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards\nThen Munson Agri-Services facility has a number of systems in place for hazard assessment and mitigation.\n\nThe corporate EHS manager will perform annual hazard management audits at the facility. The audits include a physical walk through of the entire facility and a review of all EPA, OSHA, and DOT paperwork and training documentation. Action items are noted and recommendations are made.

Issues are documented and assigned to employees for follow-up. Records of all meetings are kept at the facility.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release:\nIn the event of a burst hose or defective valve, employees are instructed to shut down the transfer process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off.\n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate. All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work in concert with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak. In the mean time, a steady spray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order: 911, the facility manager, the MDEQ hotline and the MDA emergency phone number. All applicable names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\n\nCommunication Procedures with Responders:\nThe local fire department is invited to tour the Munson Agri-Services facility on an annual basis. Facility management, employees and fire department personnel have jointly discussed the location of the anhydrous ammonia and response procedures on a regular basis. Responders know the location of all emergency shutoff valves and on-site response equipment.
