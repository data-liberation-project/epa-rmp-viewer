The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Clinton, North Carolina facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program. The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). The Plant Manager and PSM Management Representatives are responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules ar"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility is used for refrigeration warehousing and storage. It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds. The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 269,814 pounds. Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\r\nDescription of the Accidental Release Prevention Program The prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure"

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly. Any recommendations from the investigation are resolved to improve facility safety.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.
