The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of Costco Wholesale's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, the City of Dallas Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the machine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility is located in a rural area at 3731 Mountain Creek Parkway, in Dallas, Texas, which is approximately 2 miles North of I-20, and approximately 1.5 miles West of the 408.  Costco Wholesale began operations at the facility in November 2003.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.

      "SummaryText": " all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the thermosyphon receiver to the high pressure receiver.  The thermosyphon receiver is used as a reservoir of liquid ammonia which is supplied to the compressors for oil cooling.  The thermosyphon receiver gravity feeds excess liquid to the high pressure receiver which serves as the main liquid storage vessel in the system.  The high pressure receiver feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the intermediate and high temperature recirculators located in the Engine Room.  As the ammonia enters the intermediate and high temperature recirculators, it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The high temperature recirculator feeds a similar vessel that maintains a low pressure, the low temperature recirculator.  Each recirculator vessel supplies pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  The high temperature recirculator serves twelve (12) 40?F cross dock evaporators.  The intermediate temperature recirculator serves six (6) 28?F meat cooler area evaporators, and the low temperature recirculator serves four (4) -10?F freezer evaporators.  Fans in each evaporator are used to draw air across and in between the coils which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia with in the coils.\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia suction from each set of evaporators is returned to each respective recirculator in which constant pressures (temperatures) are maintained based on the\nsuction pressure of the corresponding compressors.  The liquid from the wet suction return is collected in the vessel and the vapor from each recirculator is then drawn to a combination of six compressors where the pressure and temperature of t"

      "SummaryText": "he gas is increased\n\nAll six (6) compressors are single stage machines - they discharge to a common header. Compressors 1 and 2 draw vapor from the low temperature recirculator and economizer suction from the intermediate temperature recirculator.  Compressor 3 is a swing compressor and has the ability to be either a low, intermediate, or high temperature compressor.  Compressors 4 and 6 are high temperature compressors, while compressor 7 is an intermediate temperature compressor.  The compressors pull vapor from the three recirculator vessels and discharge through a common header to condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the thermosyphon receiver.  Hot gas is also used  for defrost of the freezer, cooler area, and cross dock evaporators. An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the condensers.  The system is also equipped with a glycol heat exchanger that is used for underground heating of the freezer.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through an emergency refrigerant control box in case of a high pressure event.\n\nNOTE: The Freezer is currently not in service and all piping has been valved off. As a result, the under floor heat exchanger, 4 freezer evaporators and Compressor C-1 and C-2  are also no longer in service. \n\nThe majority of the equipment is located inside the machine/engine room.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nAmmonia sensors are located in the machine room and warehouse that alert facility personnel and activate the ventilation system in the machine room and close all feed lines out of the machine room.

      "SummaryText": "nia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to regularly maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the machine room and throughout the warehouse.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibilityof any ammonia releases.\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to the water diffusion tank.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately by the refrigeration contractor.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as a general guide.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the initial startup of the facilit"

As a result of a small leak from a gasket seal, an estimated 17 lbs of ammonia was lost.  There were no injuries or property damage resulting from the ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Dallas Fire Department  and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Center will be called.  All employees and contractors will evacuate based on a high ammonia leak alarm.\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.
