Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to repackage and distribute chlorine and to distribute sulfur dioxide to water treatment facilities and general industry.  We also manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) as a byproduct of the chlorine repackaging operation.  Chlorine is received by rail car and sulfur dioxide is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers (no packaging of sulfur dioxide is done at this facility).  Chlorine from rail cars is used to fill DOT approved containers.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine at this facility is 500,000 pounds.  The maximum total inventory of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 40,000 pounds.  Average inventories are much less.\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the sp"

This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment and personal protective equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1969.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nIn 2003, we developed a new security plan to help guard against intentional misuse of hazardous chemicals.  We are continuing to evaluate and implement new security measures by sharing knowledge with other Harcros facilities and general industry."
