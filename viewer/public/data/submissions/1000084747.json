This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n? To save lives.\n\n? To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n? To protect the environment.\n\n? To minimize property damage.\n\nAmericold maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for\n\nthe facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes,\n\nammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to\n\nemergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\nThis Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as\n\nto incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold, Sumter facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage\n\nwarehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through\n\nvarious physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor,\n\nthen back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in\n\npressures are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers\n\nits temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.\n\nRemoval of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later\n\nremoved from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from\n\nvacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on"
