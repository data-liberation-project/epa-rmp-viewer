Two 30,000 gallon propane storage tanks are located on-site.  The LP-Gas is used as an alternative process fuel during the winter months, when the surrounding community needs more natural gas for heating their homes. Both tanks are connected to a converter system which changes the propane into the equivalent of natural gas for use in various curing ovens. \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Nashville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWorst-case scenario:  Our worst-case scenario is the failure of one of the tanks and a resulting vapor cloud explosion (maximum tank capacity is 85% of nominal capacity at 60 F).  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi over-pressure is 0.5 miles.  The majority of this area is un-occupied land such as farmland.\n\nAccidental release prevention program:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and all applicable laws.\n\nFive-year accident history:  This facility has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Nashville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  Members of the local fire have inspected our propane system.\n\nPlanned chan"
