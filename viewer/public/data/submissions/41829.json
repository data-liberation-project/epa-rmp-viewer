We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces aerosol products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  We use mixtures of flammable gases as propellants in a variety of packaged aerosol products.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nWe use no reportable quantities of toxics in our manufacturing process.\n\nFlammables\n\nWe use several flammable gas mixtures as propellants in aerosol products prepared at our facility.\n\n1.  A 14,700-gallon (approximately 52,800 pounds) storage tank stores A-70, a two-way blend of propane and butane.\n\n2.  A 9,200-gallon (approximately 34,500 pounds) storage tank stores A-"

A 9,200-gallon (approximately 40,600 pounds) storage tank stores dimethyl ether.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nNot applicable.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nNot applicable.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nNot Required by EPA for Subject Reporting Period\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nNot Required by EPA for Subject Reporting Period\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nRigorous inspection of all flexible hoses within the process has been implemented.

All hoses have been assigned retire dates.\n\nThe piping and vessels have been inspected and tested utilizing the services of a professional inspection company.  Furthermore, reinspection dates have been established. \n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business.  Additionally, we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past 5 years, we have had no accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule.\n\nFor a significant incident, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  \n\nOur plan includes:\n\nPre Incident Planning\nEmergency Coordinator Assignment\nOutside Agency Emergency Coordinators List\nFire and Explosion Plan\nOn-Site Spill Plan  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAerosol Specialties has relocated to a newer, modern facility.
