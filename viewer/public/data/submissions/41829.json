We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces aerosol products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  We use mixtures of flammable gases as propellants in a variety of packaged aerosol products.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nWe use no reportable quantities of toxics in our manufacturing process.\n\nFlammables\n\nWe use several flammable gas mixtures as propellants in aerosol products prepared at our facility.\n\n1.  A 14,700-gallon (approximately 52,800 pounds) storage tank stores A-70, a two-way blend of propane and butane.\n\n2.  A 9,200-gallon (approximately 34,500 pounds) storage tank stores A-"
