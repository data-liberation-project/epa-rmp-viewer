Water Treatment Plant (WT2), as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68.  The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) isbeing filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSacramento County Water Quality Division operates and maintains the regional wastewater collection system outside the City of Sacramento, and also operates and maintains the chlorination process for numerous water wells and three water treatment plants owned by other County agencies.    Its water treatment facility, Waterman Rd. Water Treatment Plant (WT2), is located at 8246 Waterman Rd., Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, and uses chlorine, a RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS. There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site on a regular basis and also respond to alarm conditions.  \n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with"

Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted chlorinators and metered through rate valves and rotameters in the chlorinators and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Sacramento County Water Quality Division that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Sacramento County Water Quality Division has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of chlorine on site, in this case 2000 lb.  This release scenario is not physically pos"

The \"alternative case\" considered for this facility is the release of chlorine from the gas valve of a ton container due to an operator error during hookup, with the release secured by emergency responders by closing the gas valve after 30 minutes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Sacramento County Water Quality Division which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include Sacramento County Water Quality Division's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel following established emergency response procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sacramento County Water Quality Division are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Sacramento County Water Quality Division's operations. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things changing the chlorinators to the tank-mounted type.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSacramento County Water Quality Division's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated withSacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.Sacramento County Water Quality Division maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at sites which it operates and maintains.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Sacramento County Water Quality Division committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
