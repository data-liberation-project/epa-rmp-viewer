The facility has gone under several expansions and now additionally processes flavored milks and meal replacement drinks.\n\n\n\nThe main plant encompasses approximately 650,000 square feet and is positioned Southwest Missouri. Jasper Products does not store any regulated chemicals above the threshold limit with the exception of anhydrous ammonia. In an effort to mitigate any major release, JP installed two identical refrigeration systems and located them in opposite areas of the facility. \n\n\n\nJasper Products is in full compliance with the OSHA PSM Standard and utilizes third parties for the PHA facilitation, compliance audits and training. JP has contracted with Garden City Ammonia Program to provide training to all employees responsible for ammonia handling. In addition all employees and contractors are trained in the JP Emergency Response Plan. A minimum of one emergency drill is performed each year.\n\n\n\nJasper Products also maintains an excellent relationship with the local emergency response teams including the Joplin Fire Department, LEPC and a third party Hazardous Material Response Company. JP has a modern state of the art security and emergency response and ammonia detection system. Both fixed systems and portable ammonia detection equipment is made available to our trained responders. \n\nIn 2004 Jasper Products received the top honor from the International Dairy Foods Association as having the best overall safety performance for any Dairy processor in the United States. \n\nAccident History\n\nOn May 22, 2011, a tornado hit the city of Joplin, Mo causing a gas release through the piping at Jasper Products.  The release occurred at 5:30pm and lasted for 45 minutes. Jasper Products called in the release.  There were zero deaths or injuries as a result of this release.  There were zero environmental impacts as a result of this rel"
