      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release, Prevention Program, and Risk Management Plan for:\r\nUnited Ethanol, LLC\r\nMilton, WI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nUnited Ethanol, LLC (United Ethanol) is a new fuel-grade ethanol production plant in Milton, Wisconsin.  The facility produces grain-ethanol from corn as domestic alternatives for petroleum-based gasoline.  The used grains, or Distillers Dried Grain and Solubles, will be sold as animal feeds. \r\n\r\nProcesses conducted at United Ethanol require the use of one regulated toxic substances, aqueous ammonia, as nutrients for yeast before the fermentation process.  The substance is stored in an in-door 9,500 gallon storage tank.\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION RESPONSE POLICY\r\nUnited Ethanol is committed to managing an operative the facility in accordance with pertinent regulations and good operating practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the storage tank.  If accidental release were to occur, United Ethanol has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nFor the worst case scenario, United Ethanol used the latest available version of USEPA?s RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to the toxic endpoints for aqueous ammonia process.  The entire contents of the aqueous ammonia ( xxxxxx lbs) were assumed to be released.  The model accounts for a 16-inch high dike and in-door release.  The toxic endpoint of aqueous ammonia is 0.14 mg/L and the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is <0.1 mile. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe facility is newly constructed, hence, there has been no accidental release of aqueous ammonia.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nUnited Ethanol has developed an emergency response program that contains procedures for:\r\n\r\n1) informing the public and local emergency response agencies about an accidental release;\r\n2) documenting first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures;\r\n3) emergency response after an accidental relea"

Local emergcy responders will be contacted by the Emergency Reponse Coordinatr or delegate as needed.
