Under the OSHA Program, the facility is required to develop a prevention program, which is equivalent to that required by the Risk Management Program rule. Simplot developed and implemented the prevention program in accordance with the OSHA-PSM requirements well before the RMP required them to do so.  The prevention programs for the covered processes establish a multi-element program and management policies and procedures which when implemented will facilitate the prevention of accidental releases and will minimize any potential release.  Simplot staff assigned to work on these processes are highly trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials present at the facility, especially those in the covered processes. Each employee receives initial training and annual refreshers appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned.

An alternate scenario involving this tank is described below.\n\nAlternative release scenarios should be modeled and be representative of scenarios that may have occurred or are more likely to occur.  The anhydrous ammonia process regulated under this rule has not had any previous accidental releases in the 38 year history of the facility, therefore the alternative release scenario for this chemical is also based on a hypothetical, although more likely potential scenario.  \n\n         One hypothetical anhydrous ammonia alternative release scenario consists of an accidental rupture of an 8-inch diameter overhead transfer pipe due to an impact from a mobile crane.  The scenario assumes that the pipe is completely severed, releasing anhydrous ammonia liquefied by pressure for approximately three minutes before the automatic shutoff valves cut off the flow and/or the control operator turns off the compressors.  The contents of the unblocked pipe length is assumed to subsequently drain out, prolonging the release slightly.  A total quantity of over 45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is estimated to be released.  This scenario was also modeled using the RMPComp tool.  The impact of this scenario is predicted to extend offsite and under certain wind conditions, could potentially impact public receptors.  This release is highly unlikely to occur due to the general facility accident prevention program requiring all employees to be aware of potential dangers and other prevention steps in-place, such as signs and markings clearly indicating the location of the pipes and warning crane operators of potential danger.  \n\n          A second alternate scenario involves the release of the entire contents of the 18,000 ton atmospheric storage tank over a 10 minute period.

      "SummaryText": "native Release Scenarios:\n\t\n\tThe RMP rule requires facilities containing Program 3 processes to provide a hazard assessment of the potential worst-case and alternative release scenarios involving the regulated substances.  The rule requires that a worst-case scenario representative of all toxic substances and an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance be evaluated and reported in the RMP.  Simplot has evaluated a worst-case scenario involving the vessel of anhydrous ammonia resulting in the worst off site consequences and has determined that the worst-case scenario is dictated by the catastrophic failure of one of pressurized anhydrous storage bullet tanks.  This hypothetical release dictated by the rule involves the sudden failure and subsequent release of the contents of one tank, administratively controlled to 161.5 tons over a 10 minute time span.  This release is assumed to occur during worst-case release conditions of low wind speed, stable atmospheric conditions and maximum ambient temperature.  Assuming these conditions, the release was evaluated using EPA's RMPComp tool.  The modeled results indicate that the impact from this hypothetical release will extend offsite, and under certain wind directions, could encompass public receptors.  In addition to the extremely unlikely probability of such a hypothetical scenario occurring, Simplot has numerous prevention and safety features including elevation of the storage tanks, concrete barriers around all storage tanks, a comprehensive inspection program, pressure relief and emergency shutoff valves and water fog nozzles in place in order to reduce the potential for this scenario. \n\nThe ammonia manufacturing plant includes a 18,000 ton atmospheric ammonia storage tank that is refrigerated.  An alternate release scenario for this tank includes the release of the entire tank contents, but the smaller pressurized tank still shows the largest hypothetical impact using the RMPComp Tool.

These processes require the use of anhydrous ammonia used to provide the nitrogen component of the mono-ammonium and 40-Rock phosphate fertilizer products.    \n\nThe Rock Springs plant manufactures, transfers, stores, and processes anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the rule applicability threshold limits, therefore requiring the facility to develop a Risk Management Program and submit an associated plan.  Because anhydrous ammonia and associated processes is also subject to the OSHA-PSM standard and is not eligible for Program 1, the processes that contain this substance will be regulated as a program 3 process under the RMP rule.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated as a toxic substance under the rule.  \n\nNote that the overall maximum intended quantity of ammonia present at the Rock Springs facility is estimated at approximately 40,000,000 pounds.  This assumes that the 18,000 ton atmospheric ammonia storage tank is full, all (6) pressurized ammonia bullet tanks (161.5 tons each) are full and there are (12) full 80-ton railcars ready for departure rom the facility.  This is conservative as the atmospheric storage tank will rarely be full, it is unlikely that all 6 of the bullet tanks will be full and it is unlikely that there will be 12 full railcars in the shipping area.
