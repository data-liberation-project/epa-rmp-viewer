Manufacturing operations are conducted on a seven day continuous basis. We employ approximately 350 individuals who work nominal shift hours of 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., or 7:00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m. Approximately 200 employees are on site weekdays between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Approximately 50 employees operate the plant at all other times.\n\n\n\nProduct lines include solution polybutadiene (BR) and solution styrene butadiene (SSBR) rubbers, which are utilized primarily in the manufacturing of a"

Non - bulk raw material receipts (drum /carton commodities) are generally received via common carrier. Facilities for receiving and storage of the more volatile process materials are located outdoors in areas as remote as practical from the main plant processes. These installations are typically protected and provided with a means of secondary containment (e.g. dikes) in order to minimize hazards resulting from spillage. The physical transfer of raw materials from transport container to storage and on to the various processing units is accomplished by means of pumps and/or inert gas pressure.\n\n\n\nBR and SSBR, reaction products of butadiene and butadiene / styrene respectively, are manufactured in a continuous polymerization process utilizing either toluene or cyclohexane/ methylcyclohexane solvent as a diluent. Organometallic catalysts are added to initiate the reaction and carry it to the desired level of conversion. The resulting polymer solution is then pumped through a series of flash distillation units to recover the unreacted butadiene and a significant portion of the solvent, leaving a more viscous solution.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the remaining solvent is then separated (stripped) from the polymer using a steam distillation process. This occurs by bringing the polymerized rubber into contact with hot water and steam. Stripped vapors arising from this operation are condensed and recovered for reuse. The remaining crumb water slurry is then dewatered, dried, baled, packaged and warehoused.\n\n\n\nPBAN, a reaction product of butadiene/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid, is a batch process. An emulsifying agent or soap is utilized to facilitate the dispersion of the ingredients in a water medium and a catalyst is added to initiate the reaction an"

Unreacted compounds are either recovered or discharged after treatment to the wastewater treatment plant. The latex is coagulated by the addition of brine and subsequently dried.
