The Utility Systems Supervisor administers the City's safety and environmental policies. The Utility Systems Supervisor is responsible for various inspections of the City's facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1973 but the water treatment system was modified in 1997 and the aqueous ammonia system was added in late 2002.  The process is located at 14521 Lake Poway Road, Poway, CA 92064.  \n\nThe chlorine system for City of Poway - Water Treatment Plant consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine gas is pulled from the one ton containers to the chlorinators through the vacuum regulator.  The chlorinators are equipped with water at the injectors and the resulting chlorine solution is distributed through rotameters to other water processes at the facility. \n\nBelow provides a list of the chlorine equipment.\n\nChlorine One-Ton Containers (9) in the Storage Area\nVacuum Regulators (4) in the Storage Area\nChlorinators (4) in the Chlorinator Room (Chemical Building)\nInjectors (4) in the Chlorinator Room (Chemical Building)\nInjectors (2) in the Ammonia  Building\nScrubber System, Located at the south end of the facility..\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 18,000 pounds.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia (20% concentration) is stored in a 6,000 gallon storage tank that"

All of these codes serve to reduce the risk within the plant by specifying acceptable design criteria for the aqueous ammonia system and on-site buildings.  The system was designed and installed in accordance with industry standard and with generally accepted engineering practices. \n\nCity of Poway - Water Treatment Plant has established a mechanical integrity program for maintaining and operating the chlorine and aqueous ammonia equipment and uses the Chlorine Manual from the Chlorine Institute as a basis.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment (February 6, 2004) review of the accident history, (February 1999 - February 2004), there have been no releases of chlorine that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the California threshold of any release. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.  Also, there have been no releases of aqueous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity or the California threshold of any release.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine or aqueous ammonia were to occur, the City of Poway - Water Treatment Plant's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The last evacuation drill was performed on May 14, 2004.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  It is reviewed annually to ensure that the plan is kept current.  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe City of Poway has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response and safety at the Water Treat Plant."
