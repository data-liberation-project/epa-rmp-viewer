      "SummaryText": "OXEA Bishop LLC, Bishop Facility\nRisk Management Plan\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe information presented in this Risk Management Plan (RMP) represents the OXEA Bishop Facility's implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program (EPA RMP) regulation.  The EPA RMP regulation covers many elements: hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  The RMP regulation applies to facilities that use more than specified amounts of certain designated chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to the OXEA Bishop Facility based on its use of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED CHEMICALS\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility is located between the communities of Kingsville (Kleberg County) and Bishop (Nueces County), Texas.  It is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Nueces County.  Four employee shifts operate the facility round-the-clock.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has approximately 30 employees and a small force of contract employees.\n\nOn March 1, 2007, Advent International purchased a portion of the Celanese Bishop Facility and established the OXEA Bishop Facility.  Prior to that date, the purchased production units were part of the Celanese Bishop Facility and were covered under an RMP filed by Celanese.  The Celanese Bishop Facility began production in 1945 to provide raw materials for its fibers operations on the US East Coast.  The production units now owned by OXEA began production in 1958 and 1960; they have operated continuously since then.\n\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility?s units are nestled within the larger Celanese facility which covers approximately 1200 acres.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has two Program Level 3 processes that use several steps (i.e., hydrogenation, separation, etc.) to produce chemical intermediates.  The OXEA products are then are sold to other chemical manufacturers that use the products in their manufacturing processes.  OXEA products are used in the production of the followi"

The RMP regulation requires the modeling of releases for a toxic and flammable chemical.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the OXEA Bishop Facility accident prevention program.  Because processes at the OXEA Bishop Facility regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the summary addresses OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility expects all employees to participate in the PSM program and accident prevention.  It is our belief that the employees operating the equipment are those best equipped to prevent releases.  Employee participation ranges from compiling and updating technical data to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program and information on accidents themselves.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in the integrated management system that is maintained on an intranet-based management system available to the global OXEA population.  \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical prop"

The EHS and Technical departments coordinate changes to PSI.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment recommendations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). Process areas have documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters and strive to ensure that the processes are maintained within these limits by using process control equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as level alarms, automated shutdown systems, and pressure relief devices.\n\nOXEA Bishop maintains technical documents that provide design and construction details of the process equipment. Information maintained includes materials of construction, operations specification, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating. This information combined with written standard operating procedures and personnel training provide a basis for inspection and maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed changes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nOXEA Bishop uses a comprehensive PHA process to help identify and control hazards associated with production processes.  PHAs are performed on an established schedule, and each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage identified hazards.  PHAs are revalidated on a five-year frequency.  Details of the PHA process are available to all OXEA employees in the intranet based integrated management system.  \n\nThe OXEA PHA process uses a variety of tools to identify process hazards, accident prevention, and mitigation measures.  The PHA is conducted by a team of operations and maintenance personnel, operations engineers, and process engineers.  Technical consultants are used as necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings and recommendations to address identified haza"

Implementation of the recommendations is prioritized based on relative risk and resolution plans are tracked until completed. Final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for future reference.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nOXEA Bishop maintains written standard operating procedures (SOPs) that detailing the different production units? operating modes and provide guidance on how to respond to an exceedance of operating limits for specific equipment or process parameters. SOPs are available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform assigned tasks. SOPs provide a basis for training operators.  Procedures are revised as needed to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTRAINING\nOXEA Bishop trains employees that will operate the process equipment.  The program involves guided study, independent study, and on-the-job training.  Operators must demonstrate that they have the skills to operate process equipment safely and correctly before they are allowed to work independently.  Operators receive refresher training on a specified schedule.  Training is documented.  Details on the technical training program for operators are available to all employees via the OXEA integrated management system.\n\nCONTRACTORS\nOXEA Bishop supplements its workforce by using contractors to perform some routine maintenance and packaging.  Contractors are also used during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  In order to work for OXEA, contractors must have safety programs at least as stringent as OXEA?s.   OXEA Bishop has implemented procedures to assist contractors perform their work in a safe manner, ensure they have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of workplace hazards, understand what they should do should an emergency occur, understand and follow safety rules, and inform OXEA personnel of any hazards they find during t"

OXEA also uses a documented Safe Work Permit process to ensure that the job is evaluated for hazards and that those hazards are mitigated prior to commencing work.  \n\nOXEA personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the selection process and are reviewed periodically by facility EHS and management.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\nOXEA uses a PSSR process to review modifications that cause a significant change in the process safety information. The PSSR will help ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The PSSR provides an additional opportunity to check that construction was executed as specified in the design and all supporting systems are ready. The PSSR involves construction field verification.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY (MI)\nOXEA Bishop uses established practices and procedures to maintain process and support equipment in a safe operating condition. The MI program includes training, inspections, correction of deficiencies, and quality assurance of work products.  Maintenance personnel are trained on the process, safety and health hazards, maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and safe work processes to help ensure that they execute their jobs safely.  Documented equipment files and maintenance histories help maintain consistent performance of repairs. \n\nInspections and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the specific regulated substances (i.e., flammables).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied throughout the facility.  In the area of the plant subject to the RMP regulation, this program helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Features\nThis plant has safety equipment / features throughout the production units to detect a release, control a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. \n\nRelease detection is accomplished by the use of alarms on unit control panels to indicate releases on key equipment, and high and low level alarms on storage equipment.  Releases are controlled by the use of pressure relief devices that discharge to atmosphere and boiler system; manual and automatic isolation valves; automated shut down systems for key equipment; and redundant equipment.  The impact of releases are reduced or mitigated by the use of fire extinguishing systems, personal protective equipment for affected personnel, secondary containment, process fluid isolation sumps, and access to on-site emergency response team.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nOXEA Bishop has not had any incidents / accidents that meet the RMP regulation definition of accident.
