      "SummaryText": "OXEA Bishop LLC, Bishop Facility\nRisk Management Plan\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe information presented in this Risk Management Plan (RMP) represents the OXEA Bishop Facility's implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program (EPA RMP) regulation.  The EPA RMP regulation covers many elements: hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  The RMP regulation applies to facilities that use more than specified amounts of certain designated chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to the OXEA Bishop Facility based on its use of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED CHEMICALS\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility is located between the communities of Kingsville (Kleberg County) and Bishop (Nueces County), Texas.  It is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Nueces County.  Four employee shifts operate the facility round-the-clock.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has approximately 30 employees and a small force of contract employees.\n\nOn March 1, 2007, Advent International purchased a portion of the Celanese Bishop Facility and established the OXEA Bishop Facility.  Prior to that date, the purchased production units were part of the Celanese Bishop Facility and were covered under an RMP filed by Celanese.  The Celanese Bishop Facility began production in 1945 to provide raw materials for its fibers operations on the US East Coast.  The production units now owned by OXEA began production in 1958 and 1960; they have operated continuously since then.\n\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility\u00bfs units are nestled within the larger Celanese facility which covers approximately 1200 acres.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has two Program Level 3 processes that use several steps (i.e., hydrogenation, separation, etc.) to produce chemical intermediates.  The OXEA products are then are sold to other chemical manufacturers that use the products in their manufacturing processes.  OXEA products are used in the production of the followi"

The RMP regulation requires the modeling of releases for a toxic and flammable chemical.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the OXEA Bishop Facility accident prevention program.  Because processes at the OXEA Bishop Facility regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the summary addresses OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility expects all employees to participate in the PSM program and accident prevention.  It is our belief that the employees operating the equipment are those best equipped to prevent releases.  Employee participation ranges from compiling and updating technical data to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program and information on accidents themselves.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in the integrated management system that is maintained on an intranet-based management system available to the global OXEA population.  \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical prop"

The EHS and Technical departments coordinate changes to PSI.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment recommendations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). Process areas have documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters and strive to ensure that the processes are maintained within these limits by using process control equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as level alarms, automated shutdown systems, and pressure relief devices.\n\nOXEA Bishop maintains technical documents that provide design and construction details of the process equipment. Information maintained includes materials of construction, operations specification, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating. This information combined with written standard operating procedures and personnel training provide a basis for inspection and maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed changes.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nOXEA Bishop uses a comprehensive PHA process to help identify and control hazards associated with production processes.  PHAs are performed on an established schedule, and each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage identified hazards.  PHAs are revalidated on a five-year frequency.  Details of the PHA process are available to all OXEA employees in the intranet based integrated management system.  \n\nThe OXEA PHA process uses a variety of tools to identify process hazards, accident prevention, and mitigation measures.  The PHA is conducted by a team of operations and maintenance personnel, operations engineers, and process engineers.  Technical consultants are used as necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings and recommendations to address identified haza"
