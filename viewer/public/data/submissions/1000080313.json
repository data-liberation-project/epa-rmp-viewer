Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from an on-line storage vessel in each storage bay to one or more evaporators in each evaporator room.\r\n\r\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.

Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, the start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eyewash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility including the scrubber system.\r\n\r\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWD provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\r\n\r\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWD in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWD currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Henry J. Mills Water Treatment Plant (Mills Plant).\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWD regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWD has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Mills Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers.\r\n\r\nMills Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the a"

Mills Plant ensures that each employee newly assigned to the process, is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their duties.  Mills Plant training program includes four elements: (1) initial training and awareness training, (2) refresher training, (3) documentation, and (4) testing.  Each employee presently involved in operating the chlorine process has been trained to receive the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including chlorine leak response, as provided in the operating procedures.  \r\n\r\nRefresher training is provided every three years or less to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the Mills Plant ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their Management of Change and/or Pre Startup Safety Review procedures.  Such an update of chlorine operations training took place together with the update of chlorine operating procedures to incorporate changes in chlorine operations associated with operating the chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.\r\n\r\nMills Plant prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nMills Plant has procedures and policies in place that ensure that contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.

Mills Plant holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's safety performance.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\r\n\r\nMills Plant ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  Mills Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Mills Plant mechanical integrity program includes the following:\r\n\r\n-Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\r\n-Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\r\n-Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures; safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\r\n\r\nThe Mills Plant mechanical integrity program was updated to reflect all changes associated with the chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \r\n\r\nMills Plant requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.

This system allows Mills Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Mills Plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the recommendations and implement appropriate enhancements to the prevention program.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMills Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Mills Plant chlorine system.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\n\r\nNo chlorine releases that caused or could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Mills Plant during"

      "SummaryText": "the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\n\r\nMills Plant is a non-responding facility and, as such, does not have an emergency response plan.  Mills Plant has Technician Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases and will respond to emergency releases only to assess.  Mills Plant also includes employees trained in Incident Command System, who can coordinate with and provide technical assistance to outside emergency responders.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside City Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Mills Plant coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside City Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Mills Plant Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2004 when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Mills Plant.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Of the changes proposed, most prominent among them was a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected by vapor scrubbers, a significant additional safety enhancement and risk reduction measure. A PHA was conducted in February 2006 as part of the chlorine containment and scrubber modification project.  In October 2016 the PHA was reviewed and updated.  The recommended actions to further improve the chlorine safety developed in these two PHAs have been provided to Mills Plant staff for their"
