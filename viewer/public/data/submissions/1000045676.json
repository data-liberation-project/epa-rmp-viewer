The system was originally built as a two tank system and due to reduced manfacturing of our EPI process we have modified the system to operate on one tank at a maximum fill of 8,570 lbs plus another 200 lbs in the distribution system for a total of 8,770 lbs., below the 10,000 lb threshold. We are also reducing the scope of the covered process to only the Bulk TCS and HCL systems, no longer including the site manufacturing processing tools. We have reduced the number of EPI processing tools from 22 to 6 and changes within the tool cannot affect the covered process chemical systems. The reduction in hydrogen on site below the TQ also removes many other tools in the manufacturing process in Thin films and Diffusion. The covered process is now defined as the Bulk HCL and TCS equipment and distribution system which is owned by Fairchild as of August 1, 2014 and operated and maintained as it has since it was built by Air Products. The covered process will end at the last set of distribution manifolds operated and maintained by Air Products. Due to the timing of the new contracts, 8/1/2014, and the need to submit by 9/29/2014 Fairchild decided to file at program level 3 as we review (1) Input by an OSHA inspector that our facilities are Normally Unoccupied Remote Facilities (NURF) and are not considered covered under PSM regulations (2) Fairchild felt that filing at program level 3 vs. 2 was more stringent and (3) our documentation is in place with consideration of the RMP and PSM regulations. We are also planning to De-Register the remaining 2 systems in mid to late 2015. \n\n\n\nWe at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation (FSC) have a long-standing commitment to operating all of our processes in a manner that is safe for our workers, the community, and the environment.

An important part of our approach to process safety management is a risk management program (RMP) that helps us (a) manage the risks associated with using hazardous chemicals at our facility and (b) comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions: Risk Management Regulation (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at FSC.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\n\nA? A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule. \n\n\n\nA? A prevention program to help safely maintain and operate any process that contains a sufficient quantity of RMP-listed regulated substances such that the process is covered by the RMP rule - see Section 3 of this executive summary\n\n\n\nA? An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 5 of this executive summary\n\n\n\nHowever, the risk management program is but one part of FSC's comprehensive safety program within which we have developed and implemented multiple levels of safeguards against accidental releases and the injuries and damage that could occur from such releases.  Our overall safety program focuses on:\n\n\n\nA? Limiting the use of hazardous chemicals.  Before using a hazardous chemical, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.

When a hazardous chemical is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government codes, standards, and good practices are closely adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\n\n\nA? Limiting damage from a potential release.  Process safety is integrated into all FSC activities, with the intention of preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  However, we have trained our workforce to quickly recognize accidental releases and have organized and trained an emergency response team to quickly assess the severity of a release, to respond to stop/mitigate the release. We work closely with the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency and the City of South Portland Fire Department to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact a release may have on our workers and the community.  \n\n\n\nOur overall safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This executive summary is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We take reasonable steps to identify potential release scenarios and to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals.

Thus, all onsite personnel have been provided with the training necessary for them to address emergency situations and execute emergency response actions as appropriate.\n\n\n\n2.  Regulated Substances Onsite\n\n\n\nFSC has one process, the integrated circuit manufacturing process, which uses two RMP-listed regulated substances, each of which is in an inventory greater than the respective threshold quantity specified in the RMP rule.  These regulated substances are hydrogen chloride (HCL), a toxic gas; and trichlorosilane (TCS), a flammable liquid.\n\n\n\nFSC's RMP covered process consists of 2 bulk chemical delivery systems, HCL and TCS that are owned by FSC as of August 1. 2014 are designed, installed, operated, and maintained by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI).  \n\n\n\nTo help ensure full compliance with the RMP regulations, FSC personnel provided oversight and were involved as appropriate in many APCI activities during the design and installation of the bulk chemical delivery systems, and will continue to provide oversight and work with APCI personnel as they operate and maintain the equipment.  As appropriate, APCI personnel will follow FSC's procedures for activities such as (1) using other contractors onsite, (2) following safe work practices, (3) managing changes, (4) investigating onsite incidents, and (5) responding to emergencies.  \n\n\n\n3.

When we increased the onsite inventories of HCL and TCS above the threshold quantities specified by the EPA's RMP rule, FSC's safety and process safety programs had been upgraded and were in full compliance with both of these regulations. The following sections of this executive summary briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements.  Our accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\n3.1. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Process safety information.  FSC has established a PSM Filing System that resides either in our online \"Documentum\" system or in an Environmental PSM electronic folder.  The PSM Filing System contains all RMP-required records by either (1) containing an electronic version of the record, (2) referencing the location within the facility where the printed record exists, or (3) providing an electronic link to the record.  The PSI documentation in our PSM Filing System includes (but is not limited to) information about (a) the chemicals in our covered process, (b) the technology of our covered process (e.g., process chemistry, safe limits and the consequences of exceeding the limits, maximum chemical inventories), and (c) the equipment in our covered process (e.g., specifications, design codes and standards, relief systems, ventilation systems, engineering drawings).   We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees. Air Products also maintains process safety information.\n\n\n\n3.1.2. Process hazard analysis.  Through contractual agreement, Fairchild and Air Products perform and periodically update the process hazard analyses performed for our covered process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

The teams systematically address the process hazards that could lead to significant health or environmental consequences during both routine and non-routine maintenance using the HAZOP review methodology. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to the appropriate personnel and necessary actions are taken to enhance the safety of the process.  Each analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n\n\n3.1.3. Operating procedures.  Operating procedures for gaseous HCL and liquid TCS are formally managed and administerd by Air Products through a contractural agreement with Fairchild. The team consists of knowledgeable people in both the regulation requirments and the specific subject matter in each procedure, they verify the information in the procedure and annually certify all of the procedures associated with the process. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\n\nA? Steps for safely conducting activities\n\nA? Applicable process operating information, such as safe operating limits and the consequences of process deviations\n\nA? Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous chemical occurs\n\n\n\n3.1.4. Training.

Air Products also has an extensive training program for those employees who work on the systems at our site.\n\n\n\n3.1.5. Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program through contractural agreement is maintained by Air Products and includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our covered process.\n\n\n\n3.1.6. Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that changes do not adversely affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with another valve of identical specifications) must be approved through the management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are informed/trained on the changes.\n\n\n\n3.1.7. Pre-startup safety review.  We recognize that a new or newly modified process is historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of any new or modified process before placing it into service to help ensure its safe operation.  This review confirms that:\n\n\n\nA?

For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n\n\n3.1.8. Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is performing thorough assessments on a regular basis.  We plan to audit our covered process at least every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  To conduct an audit, we will assemble a team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP regulations and in our covered process.  The team will evaluate whether our prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP regulations and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of an audit will be documented, recommendations will be resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\n\n\n3.1.9. Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that have or could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident potentially having such effects.  When an incident is reported, we assemble an investigation team and initiate the investigation as soon as possible after the incident. Investigation results are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n\n\n3.1.10. Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation plan that summarizes the actions we've taken and are continuing to take to involve our workers in our RMP-related activities.

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program, and have easy access to all related records.\n\n\n\n3.1.11. Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with those requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the designated FSC employee reviews the completed form and the work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation. This program is also monitored and audited by our Risk Insurance carrier annually.\n\n\n\n3.1.12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  Generally, training of contract personnel is accomplished by (1) explaining to the contract employer the hazards of the covered process, our safe work practices, and the applicable provisions of our emergency response procedures then (2) relying on the contract employer to provide training, verify understanding of the training, and document the training for each of their employees before the employee begins work in our facility.  On the occasions when the contract employer does not provide this training, FSC personnel will provide the training directly to contract employees, verify understanding, and create and maintain the training records.  FSC also performs periodic evaluations to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their duties under the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nIt is also important to note that contract employers/employees performing any type of work on/near a cove"

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nFSC has had no releases in the past five years that require reporting in the risk management plan. FSC maintains a five-year accident history to document any future accidental releases meeting the specified criteria, and the documentation includes all required data.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nFSC has developed and implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to help ensure the safety of (1) all personnel working onsite, and (2) emergency response team personnel who will respond to accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The ICP plan includes procedures for:\n\n\n\nA? Informing the City of South Portland Fire Department, the Maine DEP and the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency (i.e., the Cumberland County LEPC) about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n\nA? Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous chemicals\n\nA? Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, including the use of emergency response equipment\n\nA? Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n\nA? Reviewing and updating the ICP\n\n\n\nWe have established mechanisms to ensure that all onsite personnel receive training, as appropriate, on how to recognize and report an emergency, and on evacuating from the facility.  Our emergency response team receives extensive training on responding to releases of hazardous chemicals.  The Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency is responsible for notifying the public of emergency situations, if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ICP is designed to comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the provisions of the EPA's RMP rule.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFSC constantly strives to improve the safety of our covered process.  For example, as part of our prevention program we test and inspect equipment; analyze process safety; review written programs, plans, and procedures; consult with employees; confirm completion of activities; audit for compliance; investigate incidents; and evaluate performance.  These and many other prevention program activities result in findings, recommendations, or suggestions for improvement.  Each finding, recommendation, and suggestion provided to plant management is given serious consideration and is implemented in some way if it reasonably provides an opportunity to improve employee or process safety.  Thus, FSC is constantly going through various review and modification activities in its efforts to continuously improve in the areas of employee and process safety.  It is these types of activities that help FSC maintain the high standard of safety that the plant has achieved in the past.\n\n"
