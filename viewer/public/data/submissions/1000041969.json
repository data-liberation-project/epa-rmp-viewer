IRWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees, the communities where its facilities are located, and customers.  IRWD staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIRWD has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include:\n\n\n\n - A detailed Emergency Response Action Guide\n\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for the IRWD Emergency Response Team\n\n - Incident Command System (ICS)\n\n - ICS position descriptions w/responsibilities\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure it is maintained current and to ensure compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM), Risk Management Plan (RMP), and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Initial Disinfection Facility (IDF) maintains chlorine on-site for"

      "SummaryText": " use in disinfecting water at the Dyer Road Well Field pipeline.  This is an unmanned facility.  There is a single chlorination building located at the facility housing the chlorine containers.  Chlorine gas is supplied from the containers to the chlorinators which regulate the chlorine feed.  Downstream of the vacuum regulators, the system is operated under vacuum as a safety measure.  In case of a break, the vacuum regulator closes automatically minimizing the quantity of chlorine gas that may escape from the system.  Also, the entire system is connected to the gaseous side of the storage container.  This is also an important safety feature.  The system is also equipped with shutoff mechanisms that close the main valves in case of an emergency.  The vacuum is created by water flow through a set of injectors.  \n\n\n\nChlorine detectors are provided for the chlorination building to maximize safety.  The detectors alarm locally and remotely (i.e., notify the duty operator of the plant.)  Also, the signal from the detectors is used to activate the scrubber system.  This system, when activated, draws air from the room where the containers and vacuum regulators are located and passes it through a scrubbing medium that consists of sodium hydroxide solution.  If chlorine is present in the room air, it would react with the solution resulting in table salt and water.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIRWD has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures re"

Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to PSM, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed to ensure safety.  Also, common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute are implemented in system design and day-to-day system operation.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history (June 2009  to June 2014) for the Initial Disinfection Facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIRWD is taking additional steps to further public safety.  Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps to further ensure public safety at the IRWD, Initial Disinfection Facility.  All recommended changes from the technical studies conducted as part of the RMP and PSM preparation and update have been reviewed and implemented."
