This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. Stationary source activities\n3. Regulated substances handled\n4. Release scenario analysis\n5. Accidental release prevention program\n6. Five-year accident history\n7. Emergency response preparedness program\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n9. Summary\n\n[This facility was previously owned and operated by The Pillsbury Company and was acquired by General Mills, Inc. effective October 31, 2001.]\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is General Mills' policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Chanhassen Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response preparedness.  In addition to the PSM Manual, the Chanhassen Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \n\n\n2.  Stationary Source Activities\n\nThe Chanhassen Plant is located in Carver County, Minnesota.  The plant produces baked or par-baked products, raw cookie dough, frozen pastries and muffin batters.  The products are frozen, packaged and stored in a frozen goods warehouse prior to shipment.  Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for cooling/freezing and for frozen finished goods storage. \n\n\n3.  Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration system at the Chanhassen Plant is a regulated substan"

Infrequent makeup to the system is only to replace material lost due to maintenance activities and a small intermittent purge.  The system consists of vessels, compressors, chillers, evaporators, condensers, safety relief systems, ammonia detectors and alarms.  All leaks are addressed and the system charge is maintained at intended levels.\n\n\n4.  Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRelease scenarios were analyzed using the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998).  A worst-case release scenario was defined to determine the potential emergency response procedures needed for the facility and community; however, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.  On the other hand, the alternative release scenarios are based on credible assumptions.  The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios from the Ammonia Model RMP and is representative of a pipe, valve or flange gasket leak or a pump seal leak.\n\n\n5.  Prevention Programs\n\nFor the Chanhassen Plant ammonia system, Pillsbury/General Mills followed the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \n\nPr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess Safety Information (PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the ammonia system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment design and the technology of the process.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - An initial PHA was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in 1994.  The hazard analysis of the ammonia process is re-validated at least every 5-years.  Recommendations made by the most recent PHA team to improve the safety of the systems have been addressed to further reduce the risk of an accidental release or incident.\n\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the ammonia system and for safe work practices.  Safe work practices include the use of ammonia personal protective equipment, lockout/tagout procedures, confined space entry procedures, safe use of motorized vehicles around ammonia equipment, and access control to critical areas.  Operating procedures are reviewed and re-certified annually to make sure they are current.\n\nTraining - Training is provided to each ammonia system operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system.  The company follows IIAR guidance for ammonia operator training and certification which includes initial and refresher training.  Annual ammonia awareness training provided to all employees.\n\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the Chanhassen preventive maintenance program.  Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109 and a company developed mechanical integrity program.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure is followed for all changes made to the ammonia system, including the safety systems, to ensure that the system safety and integrity are not compromised.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) - Pre-startup reviews are conducted whenever a change results"

The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup of new or modified systems. \n\nCompliance Audits - An initial compliance audit was conducted in 1995 and at least every 3 years.  The most recent audit was completed in June 2010 and findings and recommendations for improvement are being addressed.  All findings from earlier audits have been addressed.\n\nIncident Investigation - General Mills routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Chanhassen Plant.  An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \n\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees.  Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs. \n\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the Chanhassen Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems. \n\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place and include reviews of contractor performance and the inclusion of safety performance and programs in selecting contractors for work on or adjacent to the ammonia process.\n\n\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia at the Chanhassen facility in the last five years that meet the RMP reporting criteria.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Preparedness Program\n\nThe Chanhassen Plant has an emergency response preparedness program which is described in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP).

The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to ammonia.  The facility has an on-site trained hazardous material (hazmat) team for responding to ammonia releases, isolate, and minimize off-site consequences.  The ERP is coordinated with the Chanhassen Fire Department and Carver County Emergency Management and consistent with the county hazmat response plan.   The facility conducts annual drills with community first responders.\n\nThe facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors. A public communications meeting was held on May 1, 1999 in cooperation with the Chanhassen Fire Department and Carver County Emergency Management.\n\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAll recommendations from PHAs, MOCs, PSRs, mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations, and compliance audits are addressed on an on-going basis.  It is also General Mills' policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable and effective.  This continuous review process generates further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations and these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame. \n\n\n9.  Summary\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia system according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner.  The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs.
