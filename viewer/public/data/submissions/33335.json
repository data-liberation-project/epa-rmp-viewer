ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program. Associated Food Stores Inc PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program. Operating level employees, particularly the Maintenance and Refrigeration Manager and the Refrigeration System Operators, have been deeplly involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Farr West, Utah facility safely.\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the local and County Fire Departments. All Associated Food Stores Inc employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. manages a Major Wholesale Grocery Distribution Facility in Far West, Utah. The refrigeration system is required for the Storage and Distribution of Frozen and Perishable Food Items. The refrigeration system contains approximately 29,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.

SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of the High Pressure Receiver.\nA maximum release of 29,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered.\nUnder worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to 2.2 miles before dispersing.\n\nA WORST CASE release is very, very, very, unlikely to occur during the life of the facility, this is\nbecause of the release prevention and mitigation features incorporated in the Associated Food Stores Inc. PSM/RMP Program and the well developed and tested designs for Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nAn alternative case release scenario that we call WORST CASE CREDIBLE was slightly more likely.\nA 1000 pound ammonia vapor loss from ruptured vapor piping. Under worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .1 mile before dispersing.\nThis release is very, very unlikely to occur during the life of the Associated Food Stores Inc facility.\n\nAn alternative case release that we call MOST LIKELY, MOST SEVERE was slightly more likely still.\nA 100 pound ammonia loss from a failing ammonia transfer hose during the unloading operation.\nUnder worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .1 mile before dispersing\nThis release is very unlikely to occur during the life of the Associated Food Stores Inc. facility.\n\n\nIV. DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSOCIATED FOOD STORES INC..ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. conducts an annual training and response exercise with the Weber Fire District to practice, train and update the Associated Food Stores Inc. Emergency Response Program.\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. conducts an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit of the entire PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.

Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nFacility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release. The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Weber Fire District.\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes  second nature.\n\nAssociated Food Stores Inc. expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program\n\n(1) Employee Participation is the \"Key\" to a successful program.
