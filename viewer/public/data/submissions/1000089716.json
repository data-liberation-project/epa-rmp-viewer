      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nRadford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP) is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility located in Radford, Virginia. RFAAP is owned by the U.S. Department of the Army, and is currently operated under contract by BAE Systems, Ordnance Systems Inc. effective 1 July 2012. RFAAP has been in continuous operation since 1941. RFAAP maintains an accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, management of change, and employee training associated with the facility's processes. RFAAP maintains 24/7 on-site security and fire services, and coordinates with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee to provide additional emergency response expertise if needed.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances at RFAAP\n\n\n\nThe primary operations at RFAAP are propellant manufacturing processes for both military and commercial purposes. In support of these operations, RFAAP maintains more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances: nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), ethyl ether (60-29-7), ammonia (7664-41-7) and oleum (8014-95-7); therefore, RFAAP is subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68). As all of RFAAP's RMP-covered processes directly support, the facility's primary activity is defined under NAICS Code 32592 for Explosives Manufacturing. \n\n\n\nRMP Covered Processes at RFAAP\n\n\n\nThe RMP covered processes at RFAAP as of the October 2020 5-year update are summarized as follows:\n\n-- Ethyl ether in combined storage and manufacturing processes (inclusive of Solvent Recovery, Activated Carbon Recovery System and all associated storage). Despite the geographical areas covered by these processes, these components are considered one single process of interconnected piping and vessels.\n\n-- Ethyl ether in Transient Railcar Storage. \n\n-- Ammonia in Bulk Tanks at the Acid Area and Associated Piping to the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area for use "

These are considered one single RMP-covered process of interconnected piping and vessels.\n\n\n\nOnce completion of the extended commissioning and prove-out period process for the new D-Line Nitrocellulose Area is completed, the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area will be permanently shutdown.  At this time, the C-Line Nitrocellulose Area components will be removed from the oleum and nitric acid RMP processes for the consolidated Acid and Nitrocellulose Areas tankage and piping process.  Additionally, the ammonia RMP-process for Acid Area tankage and piping supportive of the C-Line SCR system will also be removed.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history was evaluated for this 2020 RMP update. For documentation purposes, RFAAP's onsite version of its RMP document summarizes and evaluates all release events associated with each covered process, regardless of severity (i.e., inclusive of minor leaks contained entirely within secondary containment and with no personnel exposure). On an ongoing basis in order to identify the occurrence of any events that trigger the RMP update requirements to EPA, all incidents of safety and environmental significant must be promptly reported to management and each incident investigated. \n\n\n\nDuring the 2015-2020 5-year accident history period covered by"

Although in this time period, RFAAP did have several acid spills that were reportable to the National Response Center on the basis of exceeding their applicable reportable quantity thresholds, none of these events resulted in either offsite damages to the public or the environment, or onsite injuries, deaths, or significant property damage.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequences Analysis - Worst Case\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Off-Site Consequences Analysis were developed.  Per EPA's guidance, the intention of these scenarios is to provide a basis for planning and discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions. Of the RMP-covered processes modeled for RFAAP, two (2) processes were addressed as flammable substance scenarios, four (4) were addressed as toxic liquids stored at ambient conditions (oleum and nitric acid), and two (2) were modelled as a toxic gas stored under pressure (anhydrous ammonia). \n\n\n\nDue to the size of the RFAAP facility, a distance of 0.8 mi is required to cause impacts to public receptors at the Army Staff Village area. Worst-Case scenarios were evaluated for all covered processes identified in the 2020 RMP, with addition of the Nitrocellulose D-Line ammonia bulk storage and piping and oleum within NGMA Storage at the Nitroglycerin Manufacturing Area. RFAAP followed EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance in developing the Worst-Case release scenarios, and verified the results via RMP*Comp against the results obtained from the EPA's Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.

Based on a review of the USGS Survey Maps for the area covered by the release, potential public receptors include residential areas, schools, and recreational areas (New River). However the RMP*Comp endpoint distance of 3.8 miles is substantively higher than that yielded from application of the EPA Guidance Worksheets and Calculations (2.4 miles). Using this latter method results in population impacts of 2,067, and would also result in impacts to residential area, recreational areas, and schools, but not to environmental receptors. Using either value, this process qualifies as a Program 3.\n\n\n\nWorst Case for Nitric Acid and Oleum Transient Railcar Storage: The worst-case release scenario associated with nitic acid and oleum in transient railcar storage assumes that the volume of the an entire tanker car (189,000 lbs oleum, 185,000 lbs nitric acid) is instantaneously lost to ground and a uniform pool of one centimeter depth is immediately formed. This is the required assumption for the worst-case modeling for this scenario, as the tanker cars are not stored within a secondary containment or impoundment. It is for this reason that although the total volume of the release is larger for the bulk storage tanks of nitric acid and oleum, the endpoint distances are larger for a railcar release since the surface area of the pool is not constrained by a dike.  For a strong nitric acid railcar, the worst case release modeling indicated an endpoint distance of 16.0 miles and impacts to a population of 140,714.

Although a legacy process to the facility, this process was not historically identified as RMP-covered because the Safety Data Sheets document this material as a nearly 50-50 mixture of nitric and sulfuric.

Therefore, development of the overall quantity as derived from the release rate and duration of release are dependent on the specifics of the alternative release scenario selected. Each individual alternative release scenario was evaluated to determine what level of mitigation is considered credible and appropriate based on the specifics of the each scenario. RFAAP considered multiple potential scenarios for each regulated substance, and subjected them to sensitivity analysis for emergency response planning purposes.  To facilitate this exercise, RFAAP utilized RMP*Comp for the modeling, in consultation with the guidance presented in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.

This failure mode was considered appropriate for this analysis due to being more credible for use in disaster planning purposes for the facility, and less duplicative than modeling a tank failure which was already evaluated under the worst-case scenario analysis. Administrative controls prevent filling of the ammonia tanks to greater than 80% of capacity, which is equivalent to a liquid height of approximately 85 inches above the tank bottom. As sensitivity analysis indicated that this scenario is completely insensitive to the duration used in the modeling, a duration of 10 minutes was selected. Only active mitigation is considered for this scenario based on the activation of the Halo water curtain system within the tank location. An effectiveness of 50% for the Halo system was assumed, although a range of effectiveness was also assessed through sensitivity analysis in order to provide a reference for use in emergency planning and response. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for ammonia indicated an endpoint distance of 0.6 miles based on RMP*Comp.

Acid transfers occur even at night, and although the two area's operators are in communication every 30 minutes, especially a partial loss of the transfer volume would not be likely identified and responded by the operators until after a period of time had elapsed. Therefore, release durations ranging from 15 up to 60 minutes were considered via sensitivity analysis, which is the average time-to-completion for a nitric acid transfer between the Nitrocellulose and Acid Areas; an event duration of 45 minutes was selected for this scenario. The release modeling for the selected alternate scenario for nitric acid indicated an endpoint distance of 1.1 miles based on RMP*Comp, and a population impacted by this release is estimated at 50. The size of the public population impacted by this release is estimated at 50 based upon the maximum capacity of Staff Village, as a 1.1 mile endpoint distance is not within offsite residential receptors.

An alternate scenario was considered for oleum involving development of an erosion/corrosion hole 40% from the bottom one of oleum bulk storage tanks in the Acid Area. As the majority of erosive/corrosive failures occur at the vapor-liquid interface, selecting a release point 40% from the bottom of the tank would also be a reasonable location exposed during the usage cycles between refilling. The release was considered to be mitigated by the secondary containment dike at the oleum and sulfuric acid tank component of the Acid Area Tank Farm. Comparative sensitivity analysis was applied to a range of release durations ranging from to up to 90 minutes, and multiple degrees of tank corrosive damage (ranging from a ?u\"-D pinhole leak to a 6\"-D area of tank compromise); all of these possibilities are considered plausible as an initial pinhole compromise can rapidly evolve to a larger damaged area due to the corrosion characteristics of strong acids. The selected scenario utilized a 4\"-D hole in the compromised tank surface and a release duration of 60 minutes, and resulted in an endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.

Each employee involved in the operation of any process at RFAAP is trained on the applicable Operating Procedures. All training includes emphasis of the specific safety and health hazards associated with the equipment and chemicals involved, as well as emergency operation and safe work practices. Initial training for each operator consists of reading the procedure, and being instructed firsthand on process operations via a walkthrough with the procedure in-hand. Upon any procedure change, each operator is retrained using the same methods as for initial training. The Training Department maintains a database of each employee's required training, including the date of the initial training, the date of the most recent training, and the date that the next refresher training is required.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: RFAAP has established written procedures to ensure the ongoing integrity of process equipment and that employees are trained in conducing these maintenance activities. Additionally, the facility has an overarching Maintenance Plan which documents the Preventative Maintenance and Inspection System. The aspects of this plan satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR !?68.73 for addressing the ongoing mechanical integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. The centralized planning and tracking system of the Preventative Maintenance (PM) system at RFAAP is Maximo, which is an asset management software platform used to track the frequency of PMs and the date that the PM is closed. In the event that a defect is observed during a PM and additional work is required, the defect is noted on the work order, the original PM is closed, and a \"PM Defect\" work order is issued to track the corrective action to completion.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Manageme"

Additionally, Form DUP-9728 - Level of Risk Assessment for Management of Change is used to determine the associated level of risk for a change. \n\n\n\nThe Plant Process Control Board (PPCB) is also a key component of RFAAP's overall Management of Change framework, and governs both process and non-process changes. Management Manual MM 1-1.02 - Plant Process Control Board (PPCB) documents this process and aids in ensuring that the applicable requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA 40 CFR Part 68, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 are met. \n\n\n\nAn additional key Management of Change tool utilized at RFAAP is its computer-based Management of Change (MOC) system that can be accessed through any plant computer with network access. In addition to providing a centralized source for accessing the current operating procedures and associated controlled documents, this system also tracks the review and approval process for the appropriate personnel prior to procedure change implementation. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews: RFAAP's requirements and overall process for pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR) are documented in DUP-9483 - Pre-Startup Safety Review, and also discussed in Plant Protection Standard PPS 1.05 -Process Hazard Analysis.  Prior to start-up, a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist form (included in DUP-9483) must be completed and reviewed. The associated checklist ensures that procedures are in place and adequate, a hazards review has been performed as appropriate, and training has been completed prior to startup. Depending on the level of complexity of the process change involved, either the Short Form or Long Form of the checklist must be completed.  Completed and approved checklist forms are retained, at a minimum, until the next"

Following such an event, an incident investigation is conducted and followed up a management review. The root cause failure investigation results and associated corrective actions are evaluated by the PPCB team, and additional corrective actions will be recommended if necessary. The PPCB may request a follow-up review be held prior to operation start-up once to ensure critical corrective actions are completed before the startup can occur.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: RFAAP's Plant Protection Standard 1.77 - Safety Incident Reporting & Investigation Requirements describes the reporting and investigation requirements for events involving explosions, motor vehicle incidents, severe storm or weather damage and spills with occupational injuries. Per this written procedure, the \"investigation team must be formed and the investigation started as soon as possible based on the class of the incident and the conditions surrounding the incident and affected area.\" RFAAP's Management Manual 3-1.01 - Environmental Quality and Safety Incident Reporting additionally describes the process for incidents that are classified as environmental in nature and do not necessarily trigger the Safety incident requirements. All spills at RFAAP are required to be reported and investigated as Environmental events, even if the event is a nominal release entirely contained within secondary containment and without resulting in any health or safety impacts. Investigation of even minor events and near-misses is considered a means of identifying and addressing potential issues, and thereby preventing more significant events. The incident investigation report is reviewed with all affec"

The Disaster Control Plan provides an overarching document for describing procedures, event communication and personnel responsibilities in the event of a disaster, as RFAAP recognizes that the potential for a chemical release exists as secondary to a causative external event, such as a natural event or act of terrorism. RFAAP also maintains a RFAAP Fire Prevention Plan and Hazardous Material Response Plan, as well as other response plans specifically tailored to the personnel at the operations-level and maintenance-level who interact with these processes on a daily basis. \n\n\n\nRFAAP also performs an annual training drill wherein multiple external responders participate with facility personnel in a simulated emergency event to ensure ongoing readiness and familiarity with site response and operations in the event of an actual event requiring coordinated external response.   \n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nThe completion and start-up of the New D-Line Nitrocellulose Manufacturing Process represents a significant advancement in safety for the facility.  When final prove-out is completed for the new process, the Legacy C-Line Nitrocellulose Manufacturing Process will be shutdown and decommissioned.  Although the New D-Line process will utilize the same RMP-covered substances (i.e., strong nitric acid, oleum, and ammonia), C-Line's older acid storage and mixing processes will be functionally replaced by the newer and upgraded tankage at D-Line.  Additionally, D-Line's SCR will utilize a right-sized satellite ammonia tank, allowing the legacy ammonia storage at the Acid Area and the extended piping run to C-Line to be decommissioned and shutdown as well.  Furthermore, the multi-year project to refurbish and improve the Acid Area Tank Farm, inclusive of strong nitric acid and oleum storage, is in progress and will involve improvements/replacements to the legacy tankage as well as to the secondary containment dikes was completed, an"
