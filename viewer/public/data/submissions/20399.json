It is the policy of El Paso Valley Cotton Association to assure, so far as possible, that every employee has a safe and healthful place in which to work.  El Paso Valley Cotton Association is dedicated to providing the resources necessary to fulfill these commitments.  It is also the policy of the company to expect each employee, contract employee and visitor to live up to the responsibility of following all safety rules and committing to safety.  \n\nIt is El Paso Valley Cotton Association's policy to ensure adequate emergency response capabilities exist to handle both on-site and off-site emergencies regarding RMP-covered chemicals.  El Paso Valley Cotton Association executes this policy through employee training, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe El Paso Valley Cotton Association facility is located at 13205 Richfield Street in Clint, Texas.  The facility is situated on Tract 9, Block 20, San Elizario Grant, El Paso County, Texas. Facility Latitude is 31-Degrees 35-Minutes 17- Seconds, Longitude 106-Degrees 13-Minutes 33-Seconds. El Paso Valley Cotton Association handles Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is delivered, stored and transferred to small portable tanks for use by farmers as an agricultural nutrient. \n\nEl Paso Valley Cotton Association unloads Anhydrous Ammonia from both rail cars and transport trucks. The unloading process uses an air compressor to pressurize the unloading vessels and force the Anhydrous Ammonia through the transfer lines into the Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank. This process is repeated in the transfer of the Anhydrous Ammonia from the storage tank to the portable transport vessels (nurse tanks). The storage vessel has a maximum water capacity of 30,000 ga"

      "SummaryText": "llons which at a density of 5.15 pounds per gallon equates to 154,500 pounds of storage capacity for anhydrous ammonia.  However, normal operating conditions are for the storage tank to maintain a volume of 85% or 131,325 pounds. El Paso Valley Cotton Association is also covered under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Therefore, the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements as identified in the RMP.\n\nSummary of Hazards\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3) at normal temperatures and pressures, is a colorless gas made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen.  It is lighter than air and has a sharp, pungent odor that serves as a warning of its presence.  While Anhydrous Ammonia is a relatively toxic substance, it is not a cumulative poison.  It is highly soluble in water and forms a solution known as ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) or aqua Anhydrous Ammonia (commonly used as a household cleaner).\n\nCommercially, Anhydrous Ammonia is made by combining free nitrogen and hydrogen gases under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst.  The process most commonly used is the Harber-Bosch method.  Industrial Grade Anhydrous Ammonia serves as the most economically abundant and efficient agricultural nutrient for the produce industry.  Its pungent odor serves as a self-alarming characteristic.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, (anhydrous means without water), is the liquid form of pure Anhydrous Ammonia gas, technically water-free, and the substance is used universally as an agricultural nutrient.  Other advantages are low initial cost and low pipe friction losses.  \n\nFor transport purposes, Anhydrous Ammonia is classified as a non-flammable gas by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  The nitrogen component of the substance is inert in the combustion reaction and accounts for the limited flammability of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The flammable limits at atmospheric pressure"

      "SummaryText": "are 16% to 25% (by volume) of Anhydrous Ammonia in air.  Ammonia's high lower limit of flammability and low heat of combustion substantially reduce its combustion-explosion and fire hazards. \n\nExposure to Anhydrous Ammonia causes intense irritation to the surface tissues of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.  Exposure to high concentrations of Anhydrous Ammonia may blind, burn, strangle or kill.  The effect of Anhydrous Ammonia on the skin is that of a caustic burn, varying in severity with the concentration of Anhydrous Ammonia and the length of time exposed.  Changes in respiratory and heart action are produced as reflex actions resulting from the irritation of the respiratory tract.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the El Paso Valley Cotton Association facility is a release of 131,325 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia from the system's largest vessel, the Anhydrous Ammonia storage tank, over a ten-minute period.  \nThe toxic endpoint used is 200 parts per million (0.14 milligrams per liter), as defined in the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia.  With a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, and a Stability Class of F in a rural area, the endpoint was calculated to be 5.6 miles from the storage tank, using the RMP*Comp\u00bf modeling software.  The public receptors within a circular area with this radial distance from the facility are schools, public parks, residential areas, and commercial buildings.  The total population of this area was estimated to be 23,600, based on U.S. Census data obtained from USEPA Envirofacts Warehouse.  \n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternate Case Release Scenario for the El Paso Valley Cotton Association facility was chosen to be a rupture in a liquid line.  The specific line chosen was a two-inch diameter liquid feed line, which runs from the unloading station to the storage tank. The release duration was selected to be 15 minutes.

The total population of this area was estimated to be 170, based on U.S. Census data obtained from USEPA Envirofacts Warehouse.\n\nPollution Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) relating to the covered processes is divided into three categories: chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI relating to the chemical hazards is included in MSDS's, that are kept in readily accessible locations for all employees.  PSI relating to the process technology and the equipment in the process is being collected and filed in the Operations office area. El Paso Valley Cotton Association expects to finalize the Process Safety Information not later than November 30, 2000.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) will be conducted on each covered process every five years, or when the process changes.  A PHA on the Anhydrous Ammonia transfer, storage and loading processes has not been conducted. A PHA will be conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at a minimum: Operations, Maintenance, Engineering, and Safety.  The PHA will address the hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents that had a likely potential for a catastrophic release, and engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards in the process.

All Operating Procedures will include provisions for initial startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  The Operating Procedures will also address the operating limits and the consequences of deviation from those operating limits.  Safety and health considerations are an integral component of the Operating Procedures.  El Paso Valley Cotton Association expects to finalize the Operating Procedures not later than December 8, 2000.\n\nTraining\n\nEl Paso Valley Cotton Association provides on-the-job and classroom training to employees responsible for operating the Anhydrous Ammonia unloading and transfer system.  The trainees must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the supervisor, that they possess the skills and knowledge to perform the required duties prior to being assigned the responsibilities.
