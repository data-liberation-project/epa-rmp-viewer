      "SummaryText": "Cleveland Utilities owns and operates a WWTP in Cleveland, Tennessee.  The plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are classified as extremely hazardous substances, for disinfection and dechlorination.  Two release scenarios (worst-case and alternate-case) were modeled using the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres, ALOHA(R) computer program.  The worst-case scenario (i.e., catastrophic failure due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects causing a direct release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine or sulfur dioxide over a 10-minute period, resulted in an endpoint of 2.6 miles and 2.8 miles, respectively.  The estimated number of people in the 2.6 and 2.8 mile radius is 1,700.  The alternate-case scenario (i.e.,  a gaseous release through a short pipe or valve) resulted in an endpoint of 0.41 mile for chlorine and 0.83 mile for sulfur dioxide.  The estimated number of persons residing in the 0.41-mile radius is 40 and  the 0.83-mile radius is 140.\n\nSince the plant uses and stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide in excess of 2,500 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively, it is subject to federal requirements including preparation of PSM and RMP programs.  Stringent RMP requirements (known as \"Program 3 Level\") apply to Cleveland Utilities because of Tenessee's OSHA jurisdiction.  Cleveland Utilities has developed an emergency plan to provide employees with specific details for emergency operations.  Additionally, in-house procedures are in place for training personnel on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems, mechanical inspection of equipment, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response and action plan.  \n\nThere has not been an accident involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place at this facility in the past 5 years."
