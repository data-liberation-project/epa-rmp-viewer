In fact, we have a commendable safety record based upon statistics. Our goal is to not see a single employee injured, and that requires a constant vigilance by all employees.\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nLocated in the Covestro Baytown Industrial Park, Lanxess operates a facility which manufactures maleic anhydride (used in synthetic marble countertops, bowling balls, and artificial sweetener).   \nThe Covestro Baytown Industrial Park is located in West Chambers County on 1,700 acres along Cedar Bayou.  The site is serviced by barge, rail and truck and has pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston Ship Channel region.\n\nRisk Management Program (RMP)\n\nLanxess Baytown has one process covered under RMP.   The process also is a PSM- covered process and is considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management Program.\n\nThere is one chemical used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities defined in the RMP regulations: Butane.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe site is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Baytown Industrial Park site.

Chemical-specific information (Safety Data Sheets), operating information, and information on the equipment in the process are easily accessible.  The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHAs) are conducted in each process.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHAs.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures that address normal and abnormal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\nTraining:\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of their unit and that they understand the necessary actions for abnormal situations.  Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.

All aspects of hot work and abnormal situations are controlled.\n\nManagement of Change:\nThe proper management of change generates appropriate assessment of possible impacts on the level of safety and health on an area.  All impacted documents and procedures are altered as required.  Appropriate personnel are informed regarding changes before they operate the new system.\n\nIncident Investigations:\nIncidents, injuries and near-miss situations are investigated.  Root causes are identified and documented.  Changes in the system are made to prevent reoccurrence.  Incident reports are readily available to assist other areas in preventing similar occurrences.  \n\nCompliance Audits:\nA site-wide compliance audit is conducted every three years of the PSM-RMP program.
