      "SummaryText": "Description:  Sunwest Fruit Company, Inc. was incorporated in 1988.  We pack, ship, and sell tree fruit (peaches, plums, and nectarines), as well as citrus (oranges).\n\nRegulated Substance:  To keep our products cool, we use anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.  Anhydrous ammonia is widely used as a fertilizer and as a refrigerant.  It is considered a self-alarming gas due to it's pungent odor.\n\nSafety Features:  In order to maintain the highest level of safety with our refrigeration system, we use only licensed/certified contractors (B & W Refrigeration) for design, manufacture, installation, and maintenance of our system.  There are multiple safety features built in the system to keep risks to a minimum.  In addition to mechanical safety detectors (pressure and temperature), the system includes an ammonia detection system and a computer control system.  The ammonia detection system will alarm within the building if ammonia releases are detected to allow for evacuation and system control.  The computer control system monitors temperature, pressure and the ammonia detection system and will notify and 24-hour/day monitoring service company (Matson Alarm).  In the event of an alarm, Matson will notify plant personnel and emergency responders.\n\nAccident History:  Sunwest has not had a reportable accident related to anhydrous ammonia at this facility over the past 5 years.\n\nOff-site Consequences:  Assuming the worst-case release scenario (complete ammonia release), ammonia concentrations in air could exceed the Toxic Endpoint up to 1.3 miles downwind of the facility.  Assuming an alternative-case release (hole in the ammonia system), ammonia concentrations in air could exceed the Toxic Endpoint up to 0.3 miles downwind of the facility.\n\nEmergency Response:  The California Department of Forestry and Fire will be the first responders to releases from the facility.  In addition to completing training with the Fire Department personnel, we have involved the City of Parli"

We have completed a review of our facility and emergency response procedures with the City Police and Public Works Departments.  They were provided with copies of our facility plot plan, location of anhydrous ammonia receivers, fire hydrants, drains, compressors, and other safety features.  We also reviewed ammonia hazards, release scenarios, alarm systems, and safety systems.  We have reviewed this same information with first responders from the Fire Department."
