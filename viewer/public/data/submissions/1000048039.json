Process Description\n\n\n\nThe gallium trichloride (GaCl3) process in place at the facility produces GaCl3 by reacting liquid gallium metal with chlorine within several reactors. The liquid gallium metal is placed in a reactor and heated.  Chlorine gas is introduced to the reactor and reacts with the gallium to form GaCl3. Nitrogen is used to purge the chlorine from the equipment. Once the reaction is complete the GaCl3 is then transferred to the container and cooled to form a solid.\n\n \n\nThe process consists of six reactors, one chlorine cabinet, a scrubber / ventilation system, and liquid nitrogen supply. The chlorine is stored within a dedicated room and the design complies with the NFPA400.  The main construction and safety point for the Chlorine room are:\n\n\n\n- Gas room ho"

Operating Procedures Implementation Policy \n\n5N Plus maintains operating procedures which describe all employee tasks, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, and safety and health precautions to be utilized in operation of the GaCl3 Production process. The procedures are designed to be technically accurate and result in safe operation of the process. In addition, they are designed to be understandable to the employees and/or contractors. 5N Plus updates the operating procedures as changes are made to the process or to the operating limits of the process. 5N Plus annually reviews the operating procedures and certifies that they are current and accurate, as required by the PSM/RMP regulations. If the operating procedures are found to be out of date or inaccurate, necessary updates and revisions are made. \n\nThe procedure Documents and records control (PRO-1111-001) includes the information about localisation and access to the SOP's. \n\n\n\nAll phases of system operation are covered by the written procedures. Specifically, procedures are available for [29 CFR 1910 ?119(f)(1)(i)(A)-(G)]: \n\n- Initial startup; \n\n- Normal operation; \n\n- Temporary operations as the need arises; \n\n- Emergency shutdown; \n\n- Normal shutdown; and, \n\n- Startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown. \n\n\n\nThe procedures contain process operation limits, and provide information regarding the consequences of deviation from these limits and the steps required to correct any deviations. Safety and health measures are included in the procedures to warn employees of potential risks and protective action(s) that should be taken [29 CFR 1910 ?119(f)(1)(ii)-(iv)]. \n\n\n\n5. Training\n\n5N Plus ensures that all employees involved with the GaCl3 Production processes at the facility, including maintenance and contractor employees, fully understand the health and safety hazards associated with chlorine and the product GaCl3.
