To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance\" section of this manual has been prepared and implemented. Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\n\n\nThe Coyote Maytown Terminal is a single product terminal that is serviced by both Rail and Truck. The current product through-put and stored at the facility is Butane. Butane is delivered and stored at the site via Railcar and removed from the site via transport truck.\n\n\n\nAll product is delivered to the site via Rail Tank Car. One tank car will deliver approximately 33,700 gallons of liquid. The railcars are spotted on the rail spur, along the northern facility fence, by the servicing railroad (Rainier Rail) and connected/unloaded by trained personnel employed at the facility and using Industry developed Operations procedures for Bulk Storage facilities (i.e., Operations and Maintenance Handbook for LP Gas Bulk Storage Facilities) the product is unloaded as required into transport trucks. Butane is the only product processed at this facility. The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks. The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances as indicated in the following table:\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance: Butane\n\nOn Site (lbs.) & applicability: 450,000 (applicable)\n\nOn Site lbs. = (total gallons) x (lbs./gallon)\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 3, a documented prevention program is required.
