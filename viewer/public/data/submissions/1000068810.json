Normally this carbon dioxide is vented to the atmosphere, but is collected and transferred to our facility via pipeline. The CO2 is purified and liquified using a simple process of drying and distillation. The liquid carbon dioxide is stored in our insulated storage tanks and shipped by truck to customers throughout the West.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \r\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant in the carbon dioxide liquefaction process\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\r\n\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Benicia, CA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nAn Anhydrous ammonia atmospheric monitoring system was installed to ensure the safety of our employees and the community. A carbon dioxide monitoring system is also in place. This enhances our capability to detect minor leaks before they become major events. This system is tied into our plant logic control system that alerts the plant operator of a problem 24 hours a day. The system is also designed to shut down the operation if a major leak is detected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 2020 approximately 305 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia over the course of 85 minutes was released due to a seal failure on one of the Ammonia Pumps. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\n\r\nLinde has an emergency response p"

We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
