This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. Stationary source activities\n3. Regulated substances handled\n4. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios\n5. General and chemical-specific accidental release prevention program\n6. Five-year accident history\n7. Emergency response program\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n9. Summary\n\n[This facility was owned and operated by The Pillsbury Company and was acquired by General Mills, Inc. effective October 31, 2001.]\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is General Mills' policy to comply with the all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation and all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. The plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes a description of the management system, the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), the five-year accident history, the Prevention Program elements, and an Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe plant has also developed a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to comply with OSHA PSM requirements. \n\n2.  Stationary Source Activities\n\nThe plant located in the City of Hazleton in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The plant was acquired by Pillsbury in 1999. The plant produces par-baked goods and frozen dough. The ammonia refrigeration process is used to cool and freeze the finished products. \n\n3.  Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration system at the Hazleton Plant is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The ammonia system is a closed loop which recirculates and reuses the same material. Infrequent makeup to the system is only to replace material lost due to maintenance activities and a small intermittent purge. Th"

All ambient detectors trigger a leak alarm.\n\n4.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) were used for guidance. The Ammonia Guidance tables were used to derive the hazard distances for worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\nReleasing the contents of  the High Pressure Receiver which can contain up to 8,500 pounds (87.5% at 85F) of ammonia represents the worst-case scenario. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. The alternative release scenario was chosen as a quarter-inch hole, which would be representative of a pump seal leak or a gasket rupture. The resulting distance to the endpoint also extends offsite, and public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility are within the distance to the endpoint.\n  \nDiscussion\nThe results included in this analysis indicate that the worst-case release for the ammonia process can extend offsite and reach public receptors. However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant. \n\nOn the other hand, the alternative release scenario is based on credible assumptions. The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios, based on their potential to reach offsite. As mentioned in the Ammonia Model RMP, the alternate ammonia scenario would"

Prevention Programs\n\nFor the Hazleton Plant ammonia system, Pillsbury implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur. Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the ammonia system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, equipment, technology, process flow diagrams and P&IDs.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - A PHA was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in November of 1998.  Recommendations made by the PHA team to improve safety are being addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures - Equipment Operating and Maintenance Manuals, in addition to plant specific procedures, provide written guidance for ammonia system operations.\n\nTraining - Training is provided for all personnel involved with ammonia plant operations.\n\nMaintenance (Mechanical Integrity) - The facility utilizes a computerized preventative maintenance program (MP2) for scheduling and tracking maintenance activities.  Equipment inspections, testing, and preventative maintenance activities are scheduled according to manufacturers' recommendations and/or IIAR Bulletin 109.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure has been developed and is implemented to ensure all changes are adequately reviewed and appropriate sections of the PSM updated.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) - A PSR policy and procedure has been developed to address startups following equipment or system changes.\n\nCompliance Audits - A PSM audit was performed in June 1999. Findings from the audit are being addressed.\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation policy and procedure has been developed to help determine the root cause of an incident a"

Employees were involved in the PHA  and are trained on the operation of the ammonia system.\n\nHot Work Permit - A hot work permit program has been developed and implemented.\n\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place to ensure the contractor is aware of the hazards involved in the work, and to verify the contractor will follow safe work practices in place.\n\n\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that meet the RMP accident criteria since the plant was started-up in 1996.  \n\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program\n\nPillsbury Bakery has an emergency response program in place which includes a chain of command, a emergency response decision tree, and a notification plan.  Efforts are coordinated with the Hazleton Fire Department and their notification is assured in the event of an emergency.  Emergency response teams have been assembled and emergency response coordinators have been named with members of each having specific responsibilities.  Included in the program is protocol for informing all necessary emergency response teams.  Notification and communication can be made via intercom, telephone, or two way radio.  Evacuation plans and procedures have been put in place as well.  In addition, periodic reviews of the emergency response plan are made in order to assure that the plan best suits the needs of the plant.\n\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll recommendations from the PHA and compliance audit are being addressed.

This continuous review process does generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations, but these measures are typi"

The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs. Pillsbury has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies."
