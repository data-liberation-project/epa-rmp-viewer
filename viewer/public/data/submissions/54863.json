Lathrop (Carpenter) manufactures flexible slab stock polyurethane foam (Prime Pour Process) and is one of the process that utilizes Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) (TDI) a RMR regulated substance as the prime ingredient. The second flexible slab stock polyurethane foam manufacturing process called (Rebond Process) uses an commercial 80:20 TDI blend (80 wt% 2,4 TDI and 20 wt% 2,6 TDI) with scrap/recycled polyurethane foam to produce carpet underlay padding. No other RMP-regulated substances are used at this facility.\r\n\r\n1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Carpenter Co. to comply fully with all federal, state and local rules and regulations regarding proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals toxic or otherwise. Furthermore, Carpenter is committed to protecting the health and welfare of both its employees and the surrounding community. To achieve this goal procedures, policies, preventive maintenance and training is provided.\r\nSafety depends on the manner in which TDI handled combined with (1) the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures and check lists that are used and (3) the training imparted to our personnel. In addition regular audits and inspections are conducted to ensure our personnel are aware of the safety requirements and implementing the procedures.\r\n\r\nCarpenter's Emergency Response Program is based on and to comply with OSHA Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120) including the City of Lathrop Fire Department Business Emergency Plan, state and local regulations. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification to the Lathrop Fire Department (local AA).\r\n\r\n2  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe Carpenter Co. operation in Lathrop, CA, is located at 17100 South Harlan Road, Lathrop, CA"

The North of the property is zoned for industries, South of the property has light Industrial and Commercial buildings, to East it is bound by Interstae-5 and West of the property is open area.\r\n\r\nCarpenter manufactures polyurethane foam for use in furniture, bedding, carpet cushion underlay and other applications. The manufacturing process entails the use of TDI as a reactant to produce the foam. TDI is received by railcar and occasionally by tanker trucks and is stored in two indoor storage tanks inside the building. TDI is pumped from the storage tanks to the pouring line through a strainer, heat exchanger and filter prior to entry into the mix head where it is mixed and reacts with other Catalyst and Amines to produce polyurethane foam as slabs.  After curing, it is sent to cutting stations where it is cut to the size and shape specified by our customers. The facility is monitored 24 hrs by security personnel and access to the plant area is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors accompanied by plant personnel. TDI is the only substance handled at this facility that is regulated under EPA Risk Management Program (RMP). The maximum inventory of TDI is 390,000 lbs (assumed to be 1 railcar, with 190,000 lbs/railcar) and 2 storage tanks (100,000 lbs each). This exceeds the TDI threshold of 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3  General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule; CALEPA's CalARP Program and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\r\n\r\n4  Five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nNo accidental TDI release has occurred that qualify for listing in the EPA's required five-year accident history report.\r\n\r\n5  The Emergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nCarpenter has coordinated the Emergency Response Program with Lathrop Fire Department (local AA) emergency HAZM"
