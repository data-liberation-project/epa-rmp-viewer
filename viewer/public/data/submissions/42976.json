      "SummaryText": "This facility is located approximately 4 miles South of the city of Shafter, in Kern County, California.  It is in the business of selling agricultural chemicals to area farmers.  All processes at this facility deal with anhydrous ammonia at volumes in excess of the Federal RMP Program's listed threshhold quantity.  The ammonia is delivered by either rail cars or tank trucks, and is off-loaded into one ore more of 4 storage tanks.  The ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks to either the Ammonium Polyphosphate blending process or into 500 or 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for delivery to area farmers as a nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nThe facility has a training program for employees who handle chemicals and an inspection program by management, to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  Employees are NOT trained for emergency response to accidental releases; contractors will be utilized for this purpose.  The facility has established guidelines for the notification of government agencies in the event of an accidental release which threatens to travel off-site.\n\nProgram 2 is the default program for all facilities.  This facility does not manufacture fertilizers.  It purchases agricultural chemicals and sells them to farmers who use them for crop production.  As such, it is not an OSHA PSM facility, nor does it have an NAICS Code which requires a Program 3.  The facility has public receptors within its worst-case zone and therefore does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 is therefore selected for this facility.\n\nThe prevention program emphasizes procedural and managerial steps which enhance maintenance and training.  There has been one accident in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program is limited to the facility evacuation plan (for which employees have been trained), the county-wide emergency plan with the Kern County Fire Protection District serving as the primary emergency responder, and provisions for notifying area schools and municipal agencie"
