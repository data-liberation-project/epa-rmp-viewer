The site is located approximately 40 miles from the nearest residential neighbor, approximately 10 miles from the nearest industrial facility, and approximately 2.5 miles from the nearest railroad or major highway.\n\n\n\nThe facility accepts for disposal a variety of hazardous wastes by container, tanker truck, or rolloff truck.  Inbound receipts of waste materials for disposal fluctuate dramatically by volume and concentration.  Aragonite makes every effort to control inbound receipts to avoid exceeding RMP thresholds on-site.  All inbound materials are profiled in advance, physically inspected upon arrival, weighed upon arrival, and sampled upon arrival.  Sample analysis is used to determine handling methodology, confirm the materials match what was previously profiled, and to determine incineration feed rates.  Analysis is generally used only to confirm decision making for business or disposal purposes.  RMP constituents are generally not analyzed and the pre-shipment profiling is used to determine the concentration of RMP constituents that may be present at any time.  These are generally based upon generator knowledge and frequently are a worst-case determination.  It has been found that geneators of waste frequently over-estimate concentration ranges when profiling their waste streams.\n\n\n\nAragonite facilities consist of fully permitted secondary containment areas for all waste materials in storage.  Materials are inspected, sampled and placed into storage until a determination as to the proper handling can be made for incineration.  All containment/storage areas are fully permitted for the materials placed into storage.  All ignitable storage areas contain appropriate fire protection equipment upto and including fire sprinklers.

Employees are routinely trained in excess of regulatory requirements to perform their duties.\n\n\n\nAragonite utilizes emergency communications equipment including handheld radios, cellular telephones, landline telephones and public address systems.  The facility is equipped with alarms, loudspeakers and sirens to alert visitors and employees of dangers.  The facility performs a quarterly evacuation drill of the site and coordinates emergency response activities with nearby industrial neighbors and local emergency coordinators.  Many site employees volunteer their time as EMT's, Firemen, and/or other emergency responders for local communities and counties.  The site is also equipped with two fire engines and one ambulance.  Employees are trained as first responders and EMTs for site emergencies.  The facility also provides support to the county in times when emergency response services are unavailable for roadside emergencies.  Site employees routinely assist the county in providing assistance to vehicle accidents along I-80.\n\n\n\nAdditional employee training includes that required by OSHA 1910.120, DOT training, confined space, waste identification and segregation, industrial hygiene, toxicology, respiratory protection, decontamination and emergency response.   Each employee receives specific training relevant to their duties.  Employees receive annual refresher training with a minimum of 8 hours classroom refresher per year.  All employees learn appropriate procedures for emergency reponse.  Spill response, fire response, medical first responders receive specialized training and frequent drills.

Thus predictive filing has become necessary.  The materials in question include butane lighters or aerosol cans confiscated by airport screeners that are identified with a large percentage of butane. Generally, the profiles assume the butane is 50% by weight which is extradordinarily high, but used for calculation purposes.  \n\n\n\nAlso included is diethylamine that are shipped primarly from sister facilities has blendable liquids with worst-case dimethylamine concentrations.  It is rare to see this constituent except in a mixture and generally the concentrations are far below that indicated on the profile.  Frequently, the material is not present at all, but continues to be reported on the corresponding profiles and thus triggers the RMP threshold.\n\n\n\nAll RMP constituents are tracked individually by monitoring the weight of the container and the percentage concentration on a daily basis for all materials on-site and materials inbound that might place the facility above the threshold.  Tracking of individual containers to facilitate disposal before arrival of another shipment is maintained daily to prevent a trigger of the threshold.\n\n\n\nThis site is fully permitted by Utah Division of Solid and Hazardous Waste, U.S. EPA Region 8 RCRA, Utah Division of Air Quality, U.S. EPA Region 8 CERCLA, and U.S. EPA Region 8 TSCA.

The materials are placed into secure storage with appropriate fire protection, and appropriate spill control equipment.  Site employees respond to all site incidents and promptly clean up any spilled material.  Received waste streams are promptly rotated through the facility such that inventory is not allowed to accumulate such that thresholds are exceeded.  All containers are tracked individually both by location and by weight/quantity.  At any time, the facility can determine the exact location of all containes in which RMP constituents might be present.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, all incidents are thoroughly investigated and reported.  All spills, injuries, fires or other incidents are used as training tools and reviewed by the site safety committee and VPP committee to prevent reoccurence.
