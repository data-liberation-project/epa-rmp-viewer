This management system, along with other Corning-\nConcord policies, provides a means to eliminate and/or reduce the potential for hazardous chemical\nreleases at the plant.\n\nPrevention Program Level 3\n\nCorning-Concord is a Program 3 facility.  Therefore, Corning-Concord's prevention program\nprovides for policies, procedures and systems that address all elements of the RMP concerning\nProgram Level 3 facilities and implementation procedures.  Corning-Concord's prevention program\nalso addresses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) Program elements, which are similar to those required by the RMP regulations. \nThe prevention program in place for the facility is maintained in Corning-Concord's Process\nInformation Management System (PIMS) document control system.\n     2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n                       (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\nSite Description\n\nThe 155-acre Corning-Concord plant site is owned and operated by Corning Incorporated,\nTelecommunications Products Division.  The site is located at 14556 Highway 601 South, Midland,\nCabarrus County, North Carolina.  The Corning-Concord plant currently employs 350 full-time\nemployees engaged in the manufacture of fiber optics.  At full production, which is expected by June\n2000, the Corning-Concord plant will employ 650 full-time employees.\n\nRegulated Substance\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant that exceeds the threshold quantity listed in 40\nCFR 68; therefore, chlorine is the only substance at the plant for which the RMP regulations apply. \nThe chlorine storage and distribution system is contained in a specially designed process building. \nAll chlorine utilized at the facility is contained within the Bulk Chlorine Storage Building that is\nequipped with vent make up and exh"

Chlorine is received, stored and utilized in two (2)\nprocesses that distribute chlorine to four (4) control panels. \n\nChlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2 and serves as a chlorinating or oxidizing agent.  Chlorine\nis an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and OSHA listed toxic chemical, an irritant, and a\ncorrosive substance. Chlorine is not a carcinogen or a flammable substance.  OSHA's ceiling\nPermissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for chlorine is 1 ppm.

The first is a \"worst-case release\". The second is a more probable \"alternative release\nscenario\".  For the worst-case release scenario EPA states that \"the facility shall assume that the\nmaximum quantity in a largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to a nonspecific\nfailure.  EPA defines the alternative release scenario as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case\nscenario\".\n\nThe atmospheric dispersion modeling guidance developed by EPA in the Risk Management Program\nGuidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance traveled by the\nchlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".  The toxic endpoint for\nchlorine was determined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm).  This concentration corresponds to the\nEmergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) and is defined by the American Industrial\nHygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that\nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing\nirrevers"

The building is equipped with temperature\ncontrols and make-up vents.  The building is operated under negative pressure created by the vent\nscrubber.  There are two (2) modes of vent operations: normal and emergency.  In the event of a\nchlorine release, the vent system doubles the air turnover through the building.\n\nEquipment Design\n\nThe chlorine piping system is constructed of Hastelloy metal tubing.  This tubing is both compatible\nwith chlorine (non-corrosive) and rated to 1,500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine is only\n150 psig allowing for a 10 to 1 safety margin.  There is a chlorine monitor that detects the presence\nof chlorine in the storage building.  The monitor, along with other plant detection systems, will alarm\nto alert employees of a potential chlorine release.\n                5.0   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n                       (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n                                        \n                                                 Per 40 CFR 67.42(s), no accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Corning-Concord site\nover the last five (5) years.\n                6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n                       (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n                                                 \n\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the facility's Conti"

Emergency operation and\nresponse procedures are reviewed at each emergency response drill evaluation.\n\nThe Contingency/Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with and reviewed by Cabarrus County Emergency\nServices (LEPC member) and the Midland Volunteer Fire Department.  Copies of the program\nare given to local key agencies such as fire, medical, rescue, waste management and police\ndepartments in Cabarrus County.  Aside from the specific contingency/emergency response plan,\nkey elements of the prevention programs are incorporated into the operating culture of the\nCorning-Concord facility.\n\nThe Contingency/Emergency Response Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to releases of\nchlorine.  The plan includes training of all operators in chlorine areas, a primary response team,\nand a back-up response team.  Training is included for responding to catastrophic, severe, and\nmoderate releases of chlorine.
