The first is a worst-case release. The second is a more probable alternative release\nscenario.  For the worst-case release scenario EPA states that the facility shall assume that the\nmaximum quantity in a largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to a nonspecific\nfailure.  EPA defines the alternative release scenario as more likely to occur than the worst-case\nscenario.\n\nThe atmospheric dispersion modeling guidance developed by EPA in the Risk Management Program\nGuidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance traveled by the\nchlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint for\nchlorine was determined by EPA to be 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm).  This concentration corresponds to the\nEmergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) and is defined by the American Industrial\nHygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that\nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing\nirrevers"

      "SummaryText": "ement System\n\nCorning-Concord maintains a management system to oversee the implementation of and compliance\nwith all elements of the RMP regulations.  This management system, along with other Corning-\nConcord policies, provides a means to eliminate and/or reduce the potential for hazardous chemical\nreleases at the plant.\n\nPrevention Program Level 3\n\nCorning-Concord is a Program 3 facility.  Therefore, Corning-Concord's prevention program\nprovides for policies, procedures and systems that address all elements of the RMP concerning\nProgram Level 3 facilities and implementation procedures.  Corning-Concord's prevention program\nalso addresses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) Program elements, which are similar to those required by the RMP regulations. \nThe prevention program in place for the facility is maintained in Corning-Concord's Process\nInformation Management System (PIMS) document control system.\f     2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n                       (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\n\nSite Description\n\nThe 155-acre Corning-Concord plant site is owned and operated by Corning Incorporated,\nTelecommunications Products Division.  The site is located at 14556 Highway 601 South, Midland,\nCabarrus County, North Carolina.  The Corning-Concord plant currently employs 350 full-time\nemployees engaged in the manufacture of fiber optics.  At full production, which is expected by June\n2000, the Corning-Concord plant will employ 650 full-time employees.\n\nRegulated Substance\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance at the plant that exceeds the threshold quantity listed in 40\nCFR 68; therefore, chlorine is the only substance at the plant for which the RMP regulations apply. \nThe chlorine storage and distribution system is contained in a specially designed process building. \nAll chlorine utilized at the facility is contained within the Bulk Chlorine Storage Building that is\nequipped with vent make up and exh"
