The natural gasoline used by Nebraska Energy LLC to denature alcohol contains the following flammable regulated substances:\n\nIsopentane                Pentane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at Nebraska Energy LLC is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving 229,529 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in a single storage tank.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a low population area, the WCS could not affect nearby residential public receptors, but may affect adjacent commercial or industrial public receptors.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.2 miles.  Credit for passive mitigation measures was taken for the dike surrounding the single storage tank during the evaluation of this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at Nebraska Energy LLC is a liquid pool fire resulting from the release of a flammable mixture from over filling the single storage tank (43,576 pounds released in 26 minutes). The release is expected to be isolated by plant operations personnel within 10 minutes. Since this facility is located in a low population area, the WCS could not affect nearby residential public receptors, but may affect adjacent commercial or industrial public receptors. The maximum distance to the heat radiation endpoint (5 kilowatts / square meter) for this WCS is 0.1 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and action.\n\nNebraska Energy LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \nThe"

Because a process at the facility that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n \nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n \nInvolvement and participation by all employees and their representatives is an important aspect of Nebraska Energy\u00bfs PSM / RMP program.  Nebraska Energy LLC employee involvement in the PSM / RMP programs will ensure that all perspectives are considered and that the best ideas are implemented. In addition, all Nebraska Energy LLC employees have the right, and the responsibility, to participate in the development of PSM activities.\n\nNebraska Energy LLC will actively seek employee involvement through these basic approaches:\n\n\u00bf By integrating PSM requirements into normal work activities;\n\u00bf Through participation by interested employees on a voluntary basis;\n\u00bf Through active consultation with all affected employees and their representatives;\n\u00bf By addressing anonymous communication to any supervisor pertaining to any element of the PSM program;\n\u00bf Through participation as subject matter experts in the development of operating procedures and training;\n\u00bf Through participation on the PSM Committee;\n\u00bf Participation in MOC meetings; and\n\u00bf Participation in PHA studies.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n \nNebraska Energy LLC has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes.  The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used or produced in the process, process technology information, and process equipment data.
