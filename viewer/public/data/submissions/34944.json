Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Carroll Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia.  If an accident should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Milledgeville Fire Department, Carroll County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 28947 Elkhorn Rd Milledgeville, IL, is storage and sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of one 30,000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 760,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111, \u00bfStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00bf.

Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and the Carroll County LEPC.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR  A NURSE TANK\n\nThe storage of an anhydrous ammonia nurse tank is 1,000 gallon.  The maximum pounds that can be stored is 4250 pounds.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the nurse tanks entire contents released as a gas over 90 miinutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 4250 pounds which represents the volume of the nurse tank or as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is .36 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a failed safety relief valve.  There is no emergency shutdown considered to limit the amount of product released.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .1miles.  This release has the possibility of reaching beyond the facility boundary.  The release rate is 52 lbs/min.  \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Acci"
