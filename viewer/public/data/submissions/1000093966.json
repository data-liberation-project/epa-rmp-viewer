ADUSA Distribution LLC provides refrigerated warehousing and frozen storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 25,942 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, glycol underfloor heating, and freezer storage.\n\n \n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by ADUSA Distribution LLC- Mauldin FDC to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  \n\n\n\nThe Operator Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  \n\n\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifi"

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room, in the cold storage areas which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no federally reportable incidents nor any that resulted in serious injuries or offsite consequences within the last five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n \n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. The Facility is non-responding and has personnel trained to technically support the HazMat response team if required.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nADUSA Dis"
