The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARS\u00bfs can be used to help the Lewis/Upshur (local) Emergency Planning Committee (L/UEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with L/UEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses.
