The most recent compliance audit was conducted on January 25, 2007.  These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nExeter Specialties will promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Such investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports of incidents will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n \r\n5.\tFive-year Accident History:\r\n\r\nExeter Specialties has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our release prevention policies, there has never been an accidental release at this facility.\r\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan:\r\n\r\nExeter Specialties has a written emergency response plan that includes the accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes evacuations, notification of company supervision, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. \r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nExeter Specialties will evaluate and implement changes as necessary to assure the safe operation of this facility.

      "SummaryText": "1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at Exeter Specialties are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cold Storage of produce.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia and is used as a refrigerant in our cold storage facility.\r\n\r\nThe system is used for approximately 6 months a year in the summer and fall time-frames.  Written procedures are used for initial start up and operation of the unit.  Start up and shut down are performed by licensed refrigeration contractors and includes isolating the ammonia in the receiver tank.  During the down months the contractor inspects the equipment monthly.  \r\n\r\nThis facility fall under the CalARP program level 2.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP *Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nWorst Case\r\n\r\nOur worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from either of our largest Ammonia Receiver Tanks.  In this scenario, 3000 lbs. of Ammonia is released.  Total vaporization is assumed within 10 minutes.  Distances to the toxic endpoints are calculated considering the passive mitigation of the building.  \r\n\r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/se"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.5 miles, affecting 3,163 persons. \r\n\r\nData calculations for both anhydrous ammonia systems (1: #3,000, 2: #2,500) are exactly the same.  The same scenarios can apply to either system.\r\n\r\nAlternative Scenarios to Off Site\r\n\r\nTo calculate a release rate that would show offsite consequence, alternative release scenarios involves the release of ammonia vapor from a shaft seal that is assumed to be controlled in 30 minutes.  At a release rate of 150 lbs per minute, RMP Comp calculates the endpoint to be 0.1 miles, affecting 81 persons.\r\n\r\nThe data for this scenario is exactly the same for both anhydrous ammonia systems present at our facility.\r\n\r\nAlternative Most Likely Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of ammonia vapor from a shaft seal that is assumed to be controlled in 30 minutes at a release rate of 50 lbs per minute.  Only passive mitigation controls (such as a building enclosure) have been taken into account to calculate the scenario and the release is assumed to be controlled by the manual shutdown of the system.  At class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 meters/second wind speed, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is less than 0.1 miles.  At one-tenth mile, the affected population is 81 persons.  No census data is available for <0.1 miles.  This scenario is credible for both anhydrous ammonia systems present at our facility.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the California Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements set out under CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Uniform Mechanical Code.

The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of every five years or whenever major changes in the process are proposed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent review of hazards was performed on January 25, 2007.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Exeter Specialties maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Procedures were last reviewed on January 25, 2007.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nExeter Specialties has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.
