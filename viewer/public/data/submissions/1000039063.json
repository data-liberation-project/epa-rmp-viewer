The approximate location of SRP CGS is 34?X34'34\" North Latitude and 109?X16'18\" West Longitude.  CGS operates two coal fired units (Unit 1 and 2) which have a combined electrical output of 912 gross megawatts (MW).\n\n\n\nIn August 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached a settlement agreement with SRP which requires CGS to reduce its 2007 emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by 21,000 tons per year.  To meet these emission reduction requirements, SRP has implemented the Coronado Emissions Control Project (CECP).  As part of the CECP, SRP will install a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system on Unit 2 at CGS.\n\n\n\nThe SCR system will reduce NOx emissions through the use of anhydrous ammonia which will be stored on site in two 45,000 gallon storage tanks with a maximum storage capacity of approximately 390,000 pounds.  This quantity will provide approximately 14 days of anhydrous ammonia supply. Additionally, a 170,000 loaded railcar may be maintained on-site for a period of time making the maximum total on-site quantity approximately 560,000 pounds.  Due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia in a quantity greater than the threshold value of 10,000 pounds, SRP is required to meet the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions contained in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) Part 68 and the Process Safety Management (PSM) provisions under 29 CFR !?1910.119.  Through the development and implementation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), as contained herein, SRP is satisfying all requirements under 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR !?1910.119.  This executive summary is prepared in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR !?68.155.\n\n\n\n1.1    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EME"

Anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution at CGS is covered by an accidental release Program 3 Prevention Program developed and implemented by SRP.  In addition, SRP has developed a site emergency response program, which includes, but is not limited to, procedures for response to an accidental release, procedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies, and employee training on emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n1.2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCGS utilizes anhydrous ammonia in their SCR system for the purpose of reducing NOx emissions.  The anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under 40 CFR Part 68 and is stored at quantities greater than the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n \n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations, SRP has implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program for the ammonia system at CGS.  This program contains a variety of measures to prevent accidental releases, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n\n\n - Periodic hazard reviews and updates\n\n - Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n\n - Emergency response plan that is coordinated with local emergency response agencies\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations.  CGS employees responsible for handling anhydrous ammonia are thoroughly trained on safety procedures and operation and maintenance procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from the covered process at CGS in the past five years that have resulted in death, injury, or property damage on site, or known offsite impacts (deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage).\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY RESP"

The key components of this program include:\n\n\n\n  - Procedures for reporting an emergency\n\n  - Procedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies\n\n  - Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment\n\n  - Procedures for safely evacuating the facility\n\n  - Procedures for response after an accidental release\n\n  - Training for all employees\n\n \n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was completed for the anhydrous ammonia system in accordance with the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The PHA was performed using the \"What If\" analysis method.  The PHA identified 49 recommendations which, in general, fell into the following categories:\n\n\n\n  - Training\n\n  - Procedures\n\n  - Preventative Maintenance\n\n  - Physical Design\n\n\n\nAs required by RMP regulations, the PHA will be updated and revalidated at least every five years (more frequently if needed based on the Management-of-Change process) to update safety measures and implement improvements as needed to ensure the ongoing safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia system at the CGS facility.\n\n\n\n1.7    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe RMP program requires affected facilities to determine offsite impacts resulting from a prescribed worst-case scenario (WCS).  Per 40 CFR !?68.25, the WCS is defined as the release of the entire volume of anhydrous ammonia from the single largest storage tank or cylinder, over a period of 10 minutes.  In addition to the worst-case scenario, offsite impacts must be determined for an alternative case scenario (ACS), which is defined as an incident that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  For CGS, the alternative release scenario is defined as the release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a railcar failure.
