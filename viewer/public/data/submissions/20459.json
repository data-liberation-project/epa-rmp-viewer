The Facility used a proactive process of identification, evaluation, and mitigation to prevent and or control chemical releases.                                                                                                                                              The Facility's program involved a systematic approach designed to critically evaluate all components of the chlorination processes including: design, technology, operation, maintenance procedures, emergency plans, training programs, and other pertinent process elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    After evaluating the operations, the Facility took proactive steps to ensure that inventories of chlorine were managed efficiently and safety/training programs were updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Facility has also reinforced its plans to manage public safety in the event of a release. Several meetings have taken place involving the Water Resources Department, City Engineer, Fire Department, Safety Officer, Police Department, Dispatchers, and Parks and Recreation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                FPUC takes seriously its resposibility to operate its water plants in a safe manner and has therefore, taken the above mentioned proactive measures to ensure the public's safety.",

The Facility has safety programs in place to prevent accidents, as well as respond to accidents, should they occur. The Facility''s prevention programs include the following:\n\n* Risk Management Plan\n*Process Safety Management\n*Hazard Communication\n*Lockout/Tagout\n*Fall Protection\n\nTo prepare for an emergency at the Facility, the operators have been trained in the following:\n\n*Respiratory Protection\n*Emergency Action and Fire Prevention\n\nThe operators at the Facility are Florida State Certified professionals and have years of experience safely handling chlorine. They receive updated training regarding operations and safety on a regular basis. In addition, the Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorinator system or the stored chlorine, it is Facility policy to notify 911 (Fernandina Beach Dispatcher) and request response to the emergency. Additional emergency response can be obtained through the Nassau County HazMat Team, if necessary. We have discussed this policy with the City of Fernandina Beach Police and Fire Departments. Fire Department personnel have inspected our chlorine system."
