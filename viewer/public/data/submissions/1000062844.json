It is an industrial biotechnology facility that is ISO-9001:2008 and ISO-14001:2004 certified facility that employs approximately 90 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure. \n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes through a fermentation-based process. Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins, and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The site's manufactured enzymes are primarily intended for use in the grain processing industry.   The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-site Maintenance and Laboratory support.  Staff support includes site Management, Safety, Health & Environmental, Engineering, Purchasing, Finance, and Systems personnel.\n\n\n\nChemical Process Safety & Regulated Substance\n\nThe Beloit facility adheres to DuPont's corporate Process Safety and Risk Management standards.  These standards include 14 elements of process safety and Management Leadership & Commitment.  Each element includes policies and procedure that the site is held to via 1st and 2nd Party audit programs.  Management at the Beloit facility is committed to the implementation of the DuPont's Process Safety and Risk Management standard and has appointed a PSM Leader and a team of element leaders to oversee and lead the implementation of each element and the appropriate policies.  Management is committed to employee involvement and participation in many activities such as Process Hazards Analysis, Management of Change, Operation Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Emergency Planning & Response.\n\nThe Beloit facility stores anhydrous ammonia and 29.4% aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and uses them in the enzyme ma"

The longer-term goal is to eliminate anhydrous ammonia from the Beloit facility and use solely 29.4% aqueous ammonia in the fermentation process for pH adjustment.\n\n\n\nSite commitment to Safety, Health, & Environment includes the following examples:\n\nThe Safety, Health, & Environment budget is established to provide:\n\n?    Appropriate and adequate personal protective equipment\n\n?    Appropriate post-offer and annual medical examinations\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Air monitoring equipment and analysis\n\n?    Hazardous waste pick-up for a small quantity hazardous waste generator\n\n\n\nThe role of this support team includes the following:\n\n?    Help identify, prioritize and address physical hazards through plant safety audits\n\n?    Help communicate impacts to employees\n\n?    Help others to act\n\n\n\nMember responsibilities include:\n\n?    Represent their functional areas as members of the Safety Committee\n\n?    Facilitate safety program implementation\n\n?    Help to establish minimum safe work practices\n\n?    Participate in safety walk-arounds\n\n?    Communicate back to their functional teams\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Steering Committee and Process Safety Element Committee are in place.\n\n?    The role of these support teams includes the following:\n\n?    Implementation of the DuPont PSM Program\n\n?    Providing and executing implementation strategies\n\n?    Review of process safety metrics\n\n?    Review audit results and coordinate implementation action\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Core Values and Commitment to Safety, Health, and Environment guide us through sustainable site efforts.\n\nThe DuPont Commitment Safety, Health, and the Environment:\n\n\n\nThrough our Commitment to safety, health, and environment excellence, we affirm to all our stakeholders, including our employees, customers, shareholders, and the public, that we will work collaboratively to bring sustainable, market-driven and innovat"

We will make consistent measurable progress in implementing this Commitment throughout our worldwide operations and support. Responsible Care as a key program to achieve this Commitment.\n\n\n\nNew employees attend ~7 hours of initial safety training, which includes chemical awareness training as well as various OSHA and EPA-required information.  Job task training is ongoing for each employee and occurs with co-worker trainers utilizing training manuals and SOP's.  DuPont believes in being proactive in its training endeavors and strives to encourage employees to attend specific training associated with their job duties that go above and beyond the basic job requirements.\n\nCapital projects deemed necessary for environmental, health & safety reasons are implemented and supported through the capital expenditure process.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe site's Emergency Action Plan addresses how employees, contractors, and visitors shall respond to emergencies.  All employees are trained in the Emergency Action Plan as a part of the established initial safety training for new employees and is being refreshed annually.  The Emergency Action Plan outlines the responsibility of involved personnel during an incident, discusses the On-Scene Commander duties, gives instructions for securing off-site emergency response, addresses internal and external notifications including the media and public, and outlines emergency procedures for general emergency response.\n\n\n\nSpecif"

All employees are provided training as a part of the established initial safety training for new employees and is being refreshed annually.  These procedures address recognizing and reporting small spills and emergencies, PPE and tools for use in investigating and mitigating small spills, and specific instructions for site evacuation.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWe have not had any EPA reportable incidents during the past five years for the anhydrous ammonia process.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia process is new and has not had any EPA reportable incidents.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe most significant planned change to improve safety is the eventual elimination of anhydrous ammonia and replacing it with 29.4% aqueous ammonia.  This change will lower the overall risk profile of the facility.\n\nWe strive for continuous improvement of our safety systems and practices as well as maintenance and production.  Several recommendations from internal PHAs and auditing will be implemented to further improve safety and safe operations for 2017 going forward.\n\n\n\n"
