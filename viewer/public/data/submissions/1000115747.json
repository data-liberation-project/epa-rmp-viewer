The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered process (aerosol packaging) is designed, operated, and maintained safely. Compliance with these regulations helps to prevent releases from this process. Additionally, these regulations require development of procedures to minimize releases if they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: \nPiedmont LLC DBA Voyant Beauty Warehouse is located at 1248 Palmour Drive, Gainesville, Georgia.  The Warehouse provides storage of incoming components and outgoing finished products for the Main facility.  The incoming components include metal cans, plastic valves and caps, and corrugated boxes.  DBA Voyant Beauty outgoing finished products include hair products, body sprays, shaving creams, household cleaners, etc.  Many of these products are aerosols and use a flammable gas like propane to pressurize the containers so that the desired product can be sprayed from the aerosol cans. For purposes of the Risk Management Plan, the Warehouse has been divided into 2 areas, System A \u0096 Aerosol Storage and System B \u0096 Aerosol Storage.  These 2 areas contain storage finished goods that contain \u0093Flammable Mixtures\u0094.   The following is how the Warehouse flammables were calculated:\n\nSystem A \u0096 Aerosol Storage\nAverage size container \u0096 8 oz.\t\t\t\nAverage Aerosol ration \u0096 50%\t\t\t\n0.03 percent aerosol ounces\n0.06 gallons per container\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTotal Pounds:\t0.28\tSystem A\n\nSystem B \u0096 Aerosol Storage\nAverage size container \u0096 8 oz.\t\t\t\nAverage Aerosol ration \u0096 50%\t\t\t\n0.03 percent aerosol ounces\n0."

The Risk Management Plan has been prepared to include predictive filling, as the flammable propellant content of the packaged goods in storage may vary from 0 pounds to over 1,000,000 pounds.\nFor this Plan, System B was determined to be the worst case.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: \nPiedmont LLC DBA Voyant Beauty believes the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.

Quick actions can minimize the damage to both humans and the natural surroundings. Piedmont LLC DBA Voyant Beauty has coordinated emergency response efforts with appropriate local agencies and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: \nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas.
