In 2004, a flammable mixture was used to described the entire process.  In 2009, the mixture has been divided into several chemicals that more accurately describe the process, along with the storage vessels and capacities.  Worst case scenarios and alternative case scenarios have also been updated to correspond to these changes. \n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant, located in Point Comfort, Texas, operates a two step process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate) from natural gas.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has several regulated flammables as part of the natural gas liquids, they are methane, ethane, propane  butane, and pentane. Methane is less than 1% of the total mixture.  The plant has separate storage for propane, as well as butane and pentane flammable mixture.  The plant does not contain any toxic materials above the threshold quantities requiring a RMP submittal.\n \n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the Environment"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents (operating procedures) and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A PSM management document summarizing the reference documents and their location is being developed and will be readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are handled by local management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are planned for completion in 1999 and will be conducted every 5 years until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and  (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant's operating procedures contain procedures that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees will receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator will be paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skill demonstrations) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is scheduled to be conducted at least every year.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  However, the use of contractors is minimal.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant is implementing practices to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplce, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Inspections and tests are planned to be performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or employees will use the management of change system to review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant is developing procedures and practices, applicable to the level of risk, that incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  At present quality assurance is maintained by only using original equipment specifications to order replacement parts, using the original equipment manufacturers to do specialized maintenance and or using certified shops to conduct repair work to national codes.  This helps ensure that new or repaired equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include:  (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that a"

These procedures (and other), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has developed a comprehensive system to manage changes for the covered process.  This system will require that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes will be reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel will be provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's finding and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
