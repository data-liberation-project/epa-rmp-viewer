Both machine rooms are inter-connected to serve all of the cold storage rooms at the facility.  The system has ammonia detection in all cold storage rooms and areas.  The system is controlled by a computer, which will automatically shutdown liquid ammonia flow to a room if a rooms ammonia detector is activated.  There are also other safeguards in the system such as high liquid level shutoffs, and relief valves on all pressure vessels. The system also has an emergency pressure control system, which will automatically shutdown the system independent of other safety controls.",

      "SummaryText": "The Cowiche Growers, Inc. facility is a fruit storage and packing warehouse using ammonia as the refrigerant. The refrigeration system is single stage, and all cooling areas are a flooded style of system.  There are two machine rooms that serve the storage rooms.  In the machine rooms is located the compressors, suction accumulator(s), high-pressure receivers, and other piping associated with the system.  There is evaporative style condensers located either above or beside the machine rooms.  All defrosting of the air cooling units is done with water.  The system is primarily controlled by a computer system, which monitors and logs temperatures and pressures. There are ammonia sensors in every cold storage room, which will automatically shutdown liquid flow to any zone in which an ammonia leak is detected.  The system load is at its peak for approximately 6 weeks during the harvest season.  The rest of the year the refrigeration load is greatly reduced.\nThe worse case scenario was taken to be a failure of one of the high-pressure receivers, which would have the largest amount of ammonia.  This worse case is very unlikely because of ammonia detection, and that the vessel would rarely, if ever, have the quantity of ammonia assumed to be in the vessel.  Several alternative scenarios were considered.  The most likely was determined to be a pipe leak.  Due to engineering controls (ammonia detection, computer control system) this release should be of short duration, with little or no impact on the surrounding area.\nSafety of all employees and others who may be on site is important to Cowiche Growers, Inc.  Cowiche Growers has an emergency action plan, and trains all employees to understand what is to be done if an ammonia release should occur.  Also, any contractors working on site are instructed in what they should do if they discover a leak, or a leak occurs somewhere at the facility and they are to evacuate.  Evacuation drills are done usually twice per year so that se"

      "SummaryText": "asonal workers are properly informed on how to respond.  There has been identified a primary and secondary gathering location for evacuations. Cowiche Growers also works closely with the local fire department, and the county LEPC.\nThere have been no ammonia releases at the facility in the last five years.\nCowiche Growers continues to stress safety at the site through monthly safety meetings, and semi-annul drills.  To further reduce the possibility of an ammonia release, vessel changes are being planned which will ensure better physical security and temperature stable area for storage of ammonia.  Ammonia detection has been added to a machine room to further reduce the possibility of a release.  In addition, intrusion alarms have been installed in both engine rooms to deter theft.  Following the mechanical integrity program, all equipment and safety systems are inspected and tested annually to assure proper operation.   The RMP program is a living, active program that Cowiche Growers plans to continue, to assure both a safe and efficiently operated refrigeration system."
