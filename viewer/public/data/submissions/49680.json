The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the company.\n\nTo accomplish JM Smuckers of Scottsville Ky's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a comprehensive Safety Program that not only includes government mandated safety programs, but also includes safety programs and activities that have been identified industry wide for the prevention of accidents. The objectives of JM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Program are to achieve maximum productivity, efficiency and safety performance.\n\nOne of the activities associated with JM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response program. These programs are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68). JM Smuckers of Scottsville Kentucky Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response program is to prevent the release of ammonia and to minimize the consequences of ammonia releases. The accidental release prevention and emergency response program is also established for the prevention and response to fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of incidents that may result in catastrophic acciden"

Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility operates an uncrustables plant at 1070 Smith grove Road Scottsville Kentucky. \n\nThe facility operates an (compound) ammonia refrigeration system, in which to freeze their product for storage and distribution. Due to the number of safety features put place to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the environment and with the remote possibility of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system would pose a risk to offsite public receptors and have offsite impacts, our refrigeration system is subject to the Program Level 1 requirements of EPA's RMP.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-case Scenarios\n1. Worst-Case\nThe worst-case release scenario at that facility involves the release of  11,520 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period at a release rate 22.1 pounds per minute due to over-filling high pressure receiver during a pump-down. The maximum level of vessel HPR  is limited to 80% of the vessel. \n\nThe worst-case scenario is unlikely for the following reasoons:\n\n-JM Smuckers of Scottsville Ky has policies to enforce only that competent personnel work on the system and has the power to remove any offending employee and/or contractor from the companies payroll and or contracts.\n-The system was designed using standard using standard practices and is maintained by rigid company standards.\n-The maintenance program includes a mechanical integrity audit system.\n-The maintenance program includes a shift monitoring procedure of the refrigeration system by fully trained personnel.\n-Low level controls, sensors for ammonia monitoring, and maintaining a safe ammonia liquid supply to the vessels acts as active mitigation before the release poses a threat to offsite receptors.\n-The piping is routed to avoid impact from traffic sources. A majority of the pipes are located on the roof.\n-Forklif"

Employee Participation:\nThis program ensures that the employees are involved in establishing and implementing the prevention program. Employees are also invloved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that the employees have complete access to the program on company property. Regularly scheduled meetings are held to discuss any concerns.\n2. Process Safety Information:\nWritten information has been collected which enables the employees or members of the general public to identify and understand the potential hazards in the refrigeration system. This written information includes the MSDS program as well as a description of the design of the refrigeration system. The written information also includes the MSDS on the ammonia in the refrigeration, standards, guidelines, a"

Process Hazards Analysis:\nA formal analysis using the What-If/Checklist Technique was conducted prior to the start-up of the system to identify potential hazards. For each Management of Change and at regularly scheduled intervals, a Process Hazard Analysis will be conducted and the corporate review team will review its recommendations.\n4. Operating Procedures:\nWritten operating procedures have been developed that describes the steps to be followed to operate the refrigeration system safely. Every Management of Change and any operation involving the refrigeration system that was not previously identified will have an operating procedure developed and implemented for the actions required.\n5. Training\nA training scheduled has been established and implemented which ensures that all employees understand their responsibility during an emergency situation, whether its evacuating the building, reponding to a release, or various other responsibilities during and after an ammonia release. Additional training schedules have been established and implemented for the operators of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n6. Contractors:\nAll contractors will be screened and evaluated prior to any work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The contractors will also be periodically evaluated to ensure they perform their work duties safely.\nAll contractors that work on the refrigeration system will also be required to have an ongoing safety program that includes compliance to 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.38, 1910.119, AND 1910.134.\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review:\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review will be completed for all new ammonia projects prior to its start-up to verify that all safety programs are established, all the training has been completed by all individuals involved, and construction has been completed according to design standards and guidelines.\n8.
