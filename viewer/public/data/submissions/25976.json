              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites  local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

Facility Policy.\n \nThe owners, management and employees of East Central Iowa Cooperative(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and  propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 601,000 pounds of ammonia (262,650 pounds in two bulk storage vessels and 338,380 pounds in numerous nurse tanks parked in proximity to the bulk storage tanks) and 94,350 pounds of propane. \n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia-  The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.40 miles.  \n\nPropane- The maximum quantity released would be 94,350 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.40 miles.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is as follows:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia- The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 25976,
      "SummaryText": ".  The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.20 miles.  \n\nPropane- The alternate release scenario is a release from hose rupture caused by a pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of 4-inch transfer hose.  The active mitigation devices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 including pre-emergency planning and employee training;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-g"
