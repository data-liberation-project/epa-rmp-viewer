Active mitigation systems include sprinkler systems, scrubbers, neutralization systems, shut-off valves, and other emergency shutdown systems.

The damaged water line was directly connected to an ammonia transfer line, which was used for water injection in the ammonia truck loading process.  Due to human error, the ammonia transfer line containing ammonia under pressure was not isolated or cleared prior to conducting the repairs on the damaged water line. \r\n\tWhen work began on the damaged line, pressure was released through a valve, resulting in a backflow of ammonia into the water line and through the valve.  The event resulted in a release of over 400 pounds of ammonia, which came in contact with and caused facial chemical burns on one of the personnel performing the repairs.  The employee was transported to a medical center; however, after arrival, medical professionals determined that the employee's injuries were not as serious as initially thought, and the employee was released the following day.\r\n\tThe release of ammonia from the event also impacted a nearby highway by causing traffic to be temporarily brought to a halt; however, no evacuations of"

The plan contains procedures for emergency response, such as first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification to local emergency response agencies and the public, and post incident measures.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Pryor Fire Department and Mayes County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The latest emergency response drill was conducted on December 4, 2013 and was audited by an outside contractor. \r\nThe facility also utilizes a plant wide emergency notification system consisting of a remote wireless activated rotating siren centered in the facility and hand held radios to assist with employee notification and communications during emergency situations.\r\n\r\n3.6  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nPCC continues to improves and enhance the safety programs and culture established at the facility.
