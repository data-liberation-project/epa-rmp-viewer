If an accidental release should occur, our facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the inpact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n     The primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 275,000           pounds in 110 portable nurse tanks.\n3.  A WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of an 1,850 gal portable nurse tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity would be 8,098 pounds, which represents the volume of the portable nurse tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  \n     B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.46 mile.\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     Our facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as well as all applicable rules and regulations under the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that; have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     A.  The facility has a written act"
