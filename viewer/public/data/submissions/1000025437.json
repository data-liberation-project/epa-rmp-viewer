Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices. To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Omaha, Nebraska this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119. All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system.\n\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Omaha, Nebraska has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR\n\n191 0.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n At the Omaha Nebraska Plant WE USE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR OUR REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nPROCESS COOLING WITH\n\n Combined Inventory of 66,816 LBS.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68. For ammonia systems\n\nTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.

Process 2 (Engine Room 1)Distance to Toxic Endpoint was determined as 1.2 miles.  Process 1 WCS envelops all public receptors that were involved with Process 2 WCS.  As such the RMPlan for Omaha includes only one reported WCS, that of Process 1.\n\n\n\n       Alternative Release: The Alternative Release scenario of Process 2 (Engine Room 1) does not have any new public receptors when compared to that of Process 1 (Engine Room 2).  However Process 1 (Engine Room 2) reaches a body of water, namely West Papillion Creek.  As such only one AR is reported in the RMPlan and it is that of Process 1 (Engine Room 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Five-year accident history. On December 26, 2006 at approximately 11:45 p.m., the Tyson Foods, Omaha Bacon Plant experienced an anhydrous ammonia leak from a safety relief valve on an ammonia liquid pump resulting in the loss of 716 lbs.  The pump was isolated and the area monitored.  Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, is defined as an extremely hazardous substance per 40 CFR 355.20. \n\n\n\nIn response to the release, the plant was evacuated and the fire department was called for support.  Plant refrigeration and fire department personnel isolated the leak.  Two facility employees were given more than first aid; there were no other recordable injuries involved.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nA SCBA-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site. This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q). The team will implement control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate other than a major incident.  In the case of a major incident / release, the Omaha Fire Department would act as the Repsonders; Tyson's facility team would implement their Emergency Action plan.\n\n\n\nA written Emergency Action Plan has been developed and is on re"
