Commerce Ave.\n\nFresno, CA, 93725\n\nFacility ID 100000163431\n\n\n\n The Chem Quip, Fresno facility stores and distributes swimming pool equipment and supplies along with water treating chemicals for all associated industries. The facility is located at 4753 E. Commerce Ave in Fresno, CA 93725. The surrounding area is industrial and sparsely populated. The facility has an Emergency Response Plan to insure that all regulated substances are stored and transported in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\n\n Through the Emergency Response Plan, Chem Quip Fresno has assessed the potential effects of an accidental release of a regulated substance. This assessment includes a worst case scenario and one alternative scenario.\n\n\n\n The Chem Quip Fresno facility has established a prevention program to prevent the accidental release of a regulated substance. This program includes safety precautions, maintenance, inspections, and employee training. A response program has also been established that requires specific actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. These actions include procedures for notifying public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases, information on emergency health care, and employee response training measures.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n The Chem Quip Fresno facility handles two regulated substances in its distribution operation. The substances are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, which are used for water treatment and disinfection. The Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are stored in 150-pound cylinders in a sprinkled warehouse at 4753 E. Commerce Ave. As many as 60 Chlorine cylinders may be in inventory at one time, and as many as 8 Sulfur Dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nSpecific prevention steps that Chem Quip-Fresno has taken include daily inspections and inventories. Product is analyzed so that the lowest inventories "

Cylinders are stored in a locked area inside the warehouse.\n\n\n\nCylinders are received, stored and shipped in racks designed to securely hold up to twelve (12) 150-pound cylinders. Transport and storage of the cylinders in the secured racks minimize the opportunity of breaking off a valve head, the event that could result in a release of either regulated substance under the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no accidental release or emergency incident in the last 5 years involving either chlorine or sulfur dioxide, or any other hazardous chemicals stored at the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency plan in effect to respond to an emergency chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas release and take the necessary steps to evaluate the facility and notify response agencies and the surrounding community. The basis of the Plan is for the facility to contact the Fire Department (9-1-1) in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAfter reviewing the PSM (Process Safety Management) and Process Hazard Analysis it was revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. The Process Safety Management is committed to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety training.\n\n\n\nAs part of the proposed security measures, from our last Homeland Security inspection on February 2014, 24 hours security surveillance cameras, CCTV system will be installed throughout the facility. The Plan Measures are scheduled to be completed by the end of the 2014 calendar year. \n\n"
