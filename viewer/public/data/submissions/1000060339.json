In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire departments, response personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Regulated Substance Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is retail sales to farm producers. The Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers in our area to farm fields. This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan. Only the facility used for this product will be included in this report.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) Standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.111 for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. WESTCO requires our employees to be trained in the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia prior to working with the product. We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Training is done by classroom work, demonstration, and actual hands on training while being closely supervised.\n\n\n\nInstalled safety equipment includes but is not limited to: excess flow valves, pop-off valves, break-away couplers at risers, emergency shut-off valves, barriers to avoid"

Employees are required to wear goggles and gloves while transferring Anhydrous Ammonia and each location also has two full-face respirators available in the case of an emergency.\n\n\n\nAnnually WESTCO inspects all of our Anhydrous Ammonia plants for the following:\n\n\n\n. Pop-off valves that protect against over filling \n\n. Excess flow valves that protect against a line break.  \n\n. Paint condition and signage on tank and lines.\n\n. Transfer hose condition and expiration dates.\n\n\n\nEach of our locations has an Emergency Coordinator who is responsible for the safety of our employees and deciding if an emergency requires the assistance of Emergency Professionals such as our local fire department.  Our facilities are included in the community emergency response plans and coordinated through the Local Emergency Planning Commission. We maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThe Alliance Terminal is a newly constructed plant, therefore no accident history to report.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38. We provide State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our LEPC to ensure that they conform to the community plans. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSafety improvement, employee training, operating procedures, and equipment preventative maintenance are on-going processes at our facility.
