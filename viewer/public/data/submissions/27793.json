              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center hazardous material release Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems.  The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself.  All components of the systems were designed and installed in compliance with current IIAR, ANSI, ASHRAE and ASME standards.  In order for the system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency.  Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from start up and shut down to normal operations and emergency shut down.  Also built into the system are manual and automatic safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.  Both automatic and manual emergency shut down procedures and systems are designed and built into the system.\n\nOperator training also includes participation in process hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protective equipment in an emergency scenario.  The Process Hazard Analysis (what-if) study also helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safely and effectively in order to mitigate actual and potential releases.  Lock out/Tag out procedures are in place to prevent further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or equipment being repaired.  Spill containment and cleanup procedures and training are in place to minimize the effects of a spill.\n\nGeneral employee training involves a knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning systems and evacuation procedures.\n\nAnnual corporate internal safety audits will include evaluations and recommendations for improving and updating the program.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Distribution Center has implemented the requirements of the Risk Management Plan in order to operate each facility in accordance with regulations and support of best industry standards and practices.  The ultimate objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release.  The facility management has developed an Emergency Response Plan accompanied by appropriate training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.  In order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release the company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures. This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory safety standards as well as Kroger's own internal safety and operational standards.\n\nThe Distribution Center has a rigorous emergency response training program that follows the guidelines of federal state and local regulatory agencies.  Management believes that cooperative emergency response training must include company employees, local emergency responders and regulators in order to provide a safe workplace and environment.  In an emergency all personnel are trained to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander.\n\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center facility contains a refrigerated storage warehouse along with Dry Grocery and transportation services.  The large majority of products stored are food products intended for human consumption which pose no safety or environmental risks.  Anhydrous ammonia, a commonly used industrial refrigerant, is the refrigerant of choice for the cooling systems.  Ammonia refrigeration systems can be safely managed by properly trained operators.  The ammonia refrigeration system functions within a closed piping network serving facility operations.  The refrigeration system is predicted to contain a total of ~30,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIn accordance with EPA Risk Management regulations accidental release scenarios have been proposed and modeled in order to forecast potential effects around and outside the facility.  The primary purpose of this modeling is to provide the Local Emergency Planning Commission with information which can be used in response planning and incidents.  It also is used for Emergency Response planning and training by facility response teams.  The release model used was the RMP Comp supplied by the EPA.\n\nIn the worst case scenario model the high pressure receiver ruptures and allowing discharge of the entire ammonia content in less than 10 minutes.  The potential radius of concern was forecast to be 1.8 miles.\n\nThe alternative, more likely, case modeled forecast a ruptured high pressure pipe which released for 45 minutes.  Based on the RMP Comp model the radius of toxic effect was .2 miles for this event.\n\nThe Kroger Co. is committed to the safe management and operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Maintenance employees, the operators, are trained to operate the system using operating procedures designed to be as fail safe as possible in order to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  All maintenance employees are HAZWOPER trained technicians who will respond in the event of a release.  They are trained to act in cooperation with local responders and the LEPC to provide an effective response to any release.\n\nThe hazardous material release Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems.  The PSM program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of operations from start-up to normal operations to shut downs and emergency response situations including clean-up and restoration to operation.  Normal operations rely on the following:\n\nMaintenance Management Procedures and schedules are used to perform preventive maintenance, repairs and servicing of all system components.  Maintenance records of all work are maintained.  This ensures that the system continues to work safely reliably and efficiently in the intended manner.\n\nSet critical specifications of system temperature, pressure, level or power supply are monitored and will alarm if safe operating parameters are exceeded or interrupted.  Critical exceedances, particularly level and pressure will result in system shutdowns.  Maintenance Technicians will be notified of such exceedances by alarms or alarm indicators.\n\nIn the event of deviations Maintenance Mechanics are trained, operating procedures are written and equipment available to safely analyze the deviation and respond appropriately with safety of the Mechanics, other employees and the public being the primary concern.\n\nLock-out/tag-out, Hot Work, Pump Down and Equipment Entry/Line Break procedures are in place to ensure that all Maintenance actions and equipment are suitable to the situation being addressed.  Equipment is to be isolated, locked out and taken out of service if unsafe to operate.\n\nIf a problem cannot be addressed by facility Maintenance personnel then procedures and necessary authorizations are in place to allow obtaining outside assistance.\n\nProcess Safety information required by the OSHA PSM standard  is in place which properly describes the system and allows effective evaluation and operation of the system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses of the systems have been accomplished using the What-If methodology.\n\nContractor Safety procedures are in place and have been implemented to ensure that contractors working on or around the refrigeration system are properly informed, trained and supervised.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE READINESS\n\nWritten Emergency Response Procedures include reporting, responder and agency notification, evacuation, emergency shutdown and response procedures.  They also include training requirements and expectations and recordkeeping procedures.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan describes management of response operations.  It identifies Response Teams, assigns responsibilities and tasks to teams and team members and sets out procedures for communications, maintaining data and tracking information during a response.  Forms are provided for logging response activities.  Incident review and investigation procedures are in place to provide recommendations for improvements and prevention of recurrences.\n\nThe Emergency Response Training program includes all Maintenance employees and local emergency responders.  This allows coordination and familiarity with the systems and personnel involved.  All facility employees are trained in incident reporting and evacuation procedures.\n\nIt is the intent of Distribution Center management to not only meet any regulatory requirement but to also take a pro-active approach to implementing these requirements to incorporate these requirements into a working safety plan.  The Kroger Co. is in a constant reviewing process of its operations and industry standards in order to provide a safe working environment for our employees, customers and contractors and to avoid any harm to our community and the environment.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Facility Safety Program.  The objectives of the Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program is the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The facility Regulatory Compliance Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGreat Lakes Regional Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  A portion of the facility is a refrigerated warehouse that stores perishable and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is predicted to be approximately 30,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program.\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center facility involves the release of ~17,500 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver (HPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were us"
