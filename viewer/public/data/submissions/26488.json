The owners, managers, and employees of Maplehurst Farms are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilzation of the proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impactr of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.The maximum quantity stored would be 320,000 pounds in the facilitys 46 tanks.  The capacities of these tanks are, 1 -140,000 lb. Tank, and 45 - 4000 lb tanks.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a tem minute time span.  The maximim quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by the design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2.68 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 12000 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 1.18 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental release program.  The facility complies with the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistant with ANSI K16.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  Five year accident history.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammoni"

The Emergency Response Program.  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency respone action plan has been reviewed with local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.  Safety  improvments is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations arew performed to asses tha maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
