These reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Kitty gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Kitty gas plant has a"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\nContractors\n The Kitty gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors; 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with; 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, and 5) safe and hot work permits as required.

This commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Kitty gas plant is located about 10 miles north west of Gillette, Wyoming.  The facility includes compression, dehydration, electrical power generation, refrigerated liquids recovery and a refrigeration system.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, and a liquid product containing propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier liquids.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThere are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Kitty gas plant. \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) at the Kitty facility is the release of flammable substances from a butane/gasoline storage vessel, which form an unconfined vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario pertains to a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butane/gasoline liquids.  The content of this tank amounts to about 164,300 pounds of material.  This amount of material is presumed to release, vaporize and ignite resulting in the VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1.0 pound per square inch endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 miles.  This distance does not include any reside"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken here.  It should be noted that this tank rarely operates full, though this is volume is used in the WCS calculations.\n\nWe have not considered an alternative release scenario (ARS) of flammable substances at the Kitty plant. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   Because processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP), the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Kitty gas plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.
