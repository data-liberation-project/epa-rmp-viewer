GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nThe raw water supplied to Lubbock is treated by a conventional process involving disinfection, clarification (sedimentation), taste and odor control and filtration.  The Water Treatment Plant employs chloramine disinfection which is the combination of CHLORINE and AMMONIA.  CHLORINE and AMMONIA (chloramines) produce what is known as a combined or total chlorine residual.  The process\nof using CHLORINE and AMMONIA to form chloramines enhances the longevity of the CHLORINE.  Chloramines are used as the primary disinfectant to kill bacteria, algae and other microorganisms, which are undesirable in public water supplies.\nThe treatment process and primary quality is continuously monitored by a staff of state certified water treatment operator's 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Water quality analyses are performed by highly skilled laboratory staff composed of degreed chemist and laboratory technicians.\n\n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n    CHLORINE and AMMONIA are present at the Lubbock Water Treatment Plant.  CHLORINE and \nAMMONIA are classified as toxic chemicals under the Environmental Protection Agency's \n(EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  Some of the same properties which make\nCHLORINE and AMMONIA valuable and necessary components of the Water Treatment PlantA?s \noperation also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling each chemical\nto prevent unnecessary human exposure, including the threat to plant personnel, neighboring \ncitizens of the City of Lubbock, as well as the environment.\n\nIt is the City of  Lubbock's policy to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State guidelines and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which CHLORINE and AMMONIA are handled at the plant, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the safe handling procedures, which are in place along with the training of p"

The Water Utilities Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is based upon available information related to CHLORINE and AMMONIA.  The ERP includes procedures for the notification of the City of Lubbock Fire Department, plant personnel and any potentially affected citizenry.\n\n3. THE STATIONARY SCOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAs described in Section 1, the primary purpose of the Lubbock Water Treatment Plant is to treat raw water making it safe for consumption by the citizens of Lubbock.  CHLORINE is received in one- (1) ton cylinders by truck.  It is then utilized in the disinfection process.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, authorized contractors and authorized guests.  The total maximum inventory of CHLORINE is 40,000 lbs.  AMMONIA is received in bulk delivered by tanker truck and is pumped into a 40,000 gallon storage tank.  It is then used in the disinfection process and access to the site is regulated the same as the chlorine site.  The total maximum planned inventory of AMMONIA is 158,780 lbs.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Lubbock Water Treatment Plant complies with all applicable Federal and State guidelines, codes and regulations.  The facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute and adheres to regulation 40 CFR 302 for chlorine and 29 CFR 1910.111 for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.     FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of CHLORINE or AMMONIA  of reportable quantity at the Lubbock Water Treatment Plant within the past five- (5) years.\n\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (ERP)\n\nLubbock Water Treatment Plant employees will respond to minor releases involving CHLORINE and AMMONIA.  More involved releases of CHLORINE and AMMONIA will be responded to by the C"
