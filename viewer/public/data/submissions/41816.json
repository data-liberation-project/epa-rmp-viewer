Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe IMC Phosphates, New Wales Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, emergency equipment, participation in emergency drills, and meetings with local emergency response organizations.\n\nThis commitment is also consistent with the corporation's environmental, health and safety policy, which provides that:\n\na)  All facilities will be designed, operated, and managed to protect the health and safety of the employees and the public;\n\nb)  All employees will be educated on the applicable environmental, health and safety standards, and procedures;\n\nc)  Sufficient human and financial resources will be allocated to sustain these goals;\n\nd)  Audits will be conducted regularly to verify compliance with this policy.\n\nThese corporate policies also emphasize the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, so that all employees and the surrounding community will be adequately protected from potential fire, explosion and/or toxic release hazards associated with catastrophic releases.\n\nIt is IMC Phosphates' policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances.  If an accidental release does occur, IMC Phosphates' trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  IMC Phosphates has a comprehensive program for complying with safety and environmental regulations for all regulated and other hazardous substances handled.\n\n2.  Stationary Source(s) and Regulated Substance(s) Handled\n\nThe IMC Phosphates, New Wales Plant produces monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), and crop nutrients, as well as a variety of animal feed ingredients.  The raw materials used in this process include molten sulfur, phosphate rock and anh"

      "SummaryText": "ydrous ammonia.  The sulfur is burned with air in an enclosed vessel to produce sulfur dioxide.  The sulfur dioxide is then converted to sulfur trioxide and mixed with water to produce sulfuric acid.  In turn, the sulfuric acid is reacted with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid.  Phosphoric acid is then reacted with the anhydrous ammonia to produce the mono- and diammonium phosphates.\n\nRegulated toxic substances involved in this process include:  anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide.  However, anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance that exceeds the threshold planning quantity (i.e., 10,000 pounds) in the process.  As sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide are fully consumed as intermediates in the production process, they are not present in quanitites in the process that exceed their applicable threshold planning quantities.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in four above-ground interconnected horizontal cylindrical pressurized storage vessels at the New Wales Plant.  The anhydrous ammonia is received at the New Wales plant via a commercial pipeline.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "
