The Town of Smyrna Water Treatment Plant is committed to the use of safe procedures and prevention of chemical releases.  Our emergency action plan applies to the use of chlorine in the water treatment process a the Town of Smyrna Water Treatment Plant.  The purpose of the plan is to aid the Town of Smyrna in its efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic releases of chlorine that could result in the catastrophic loss of personnel and property within the facility and possibly the surrounding community.\n\nOur Facility.  The Smyrna Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine as its primary disinfectant in the process of treating drinking water.  The chlorine is stored in a building approximately 100 yards from the main admistration and operations building.  The building usually contains 10 tons of chlorine.  The building is enclosed and with the only possible leaks occuring at the cylinder.  The room has constant video monitoring and a chlorine scrubber along with constant air monitoring of the room for chlorine.  This chlorine monitor activates the scrubber and sounds an audible alarm and sets off alarm lighting.\n\nChlorine presents physical properties and health hazards that would present immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) conditions in the event of an uncontrolled release gas.  The following section consists of a review of the inherent physical and health hazards associated with chlorine for emergency response personnel.\n\nPhysical Properties\n\na.  At room temperatures, chlorine is a gas.\nb.  If chlorine is cooled to 29.3 degrees F, it becomes an amber color liquid.  It is usually shipped as a liquid in order to save space.\nc.  If liquid chlorine escapes from a container it will usually be boiling and convert to a greenish-yellow color gas.\nd.  It has an irritating odor (bleach) and is 2 = times heavier than air, so it will usually gather low to the ground.\ne.  Chlorine is soluble"

The minimum detectable odor level of chlorine for most individuals is 0.3 ppm.  Chlorine will cause irritation of the upper respiratory system and mucus membranes at 3 to 6 ppm.\nb.  The TOSHA permissible exposure limit for chlorine is represented by a ceiling value of 1 ppm.    NIOSH has assigned an IDLH value of 10 ppm for acute chlorine exposure.\nc.  Exposure to exposed skin or eyes can cause serious frostbite burns.\nd.  Inhalation of chlorine gas can lead to adverse acute health effects including:  irritation of the upper respiratory system, violent coughing, choking, nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath and pulmonary edema.\n\nWorst Case Senario.  Chlorine is dropped during loading/unloading/handling, resulting in the rupturing of the cylinder or valve stem and the uncontrolled release of the contents of the cylinder.  Fire in or near chlorine room allowing the fusible plug to melt in cylinder or a faulty fusible plug.\n\nAlternate Senario.  The yoke on the cylinder valve is defective, malfunctions or is improperly installed onto a chlorine cylinder,  resulting in the limited yet uncontrolled release of gas from the cylinder. The valve packing leaks from a defective chlorine resulting in the limited yet uncontrolled release of gas from the cylinder. The yoke is not properly set and tightened on the cylinder valve.

Engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment are used to mitigate the hazards associated with the release of chlorine gas.  These hazard control measures were developed and implemented to increase the effectiveness of the emergency response actions and protect emergency response personnel and the public.\n\n     Engineering Controls\n\n        * Fixed Chlorine Monitor\n\n         -A fixed chlorine monitor is located in the chlorine cylinder storage room.  The monitor will detect      \n          chlorine at 0 to 5 ppm.  The chlorine monitor is connected to the SCADA system to obtain constant\n          readings from the control room.\n\n          *Personal Chlorine Monitor\n\n          -Portable, personal monitors for chlorine are available for use during response to gas release \n           episodes.  The monitors will provide quantification of gas contaminant levels which can be utilized\n           to  determine the type of personal protective equipment deemed necessary and zones for  \n           evacuation purposes.\n\n          *Ammonia Solution Leak Testing\n\n          -Use an ammonia solution to check for leaks within the chlorine process piping or valves.  This is\n           done by discharging ammonia vapor in the area of a suspected leak.  If a chlorine gas leak is\n           present, a whitish cloud will form.\n\n          *Emergency \"B\" Kit\n\n          -An Emergency \"B\" Kit contains devices to stop leaks at the valves, fusible plugs and in the wall of \n           one-ton cylinders.  This Kit is located outside the chlorine room.\n\n       Administrative Controls\n\n          *Training of Emergency Response Team Members\n\n          -Emergency Response Team Members will receive 24-hours of Hazardous Materials Technician\n            training, which fully complies with the requirements of TOSHA 1910.120 (q) (6) (iii).
