The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the facility. The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the North Attleborough Fire Department, if necessary.\r\n\r\n(b) The Stationary Source and Substance Handled: The North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility is a stationary source operating for the purpose of treating industrial and domestic wastewater from the Town of North Attleborough as well as the Town of Plainville.   Chlorine, which is a regulated, toxic substance, is used as part of the treatment process.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The Town of North Attleborough has implemented a comprehensive program to safely manage chlorine at the North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility located at 65 Cedar Road in North Attleborough, MA.\r\n\r\nThe North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility is a public utility, though on March 9, 2018, a legislative bill was passed which applies OSHA standards to municipal workers in the Commonwealth of Mass"
