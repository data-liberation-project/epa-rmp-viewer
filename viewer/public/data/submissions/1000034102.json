We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  In 2008 we were registered to ISO 14001 to further demonstrate our commitment to environmental awareness and stewardship.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility description and regulated substances: The facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, using a pre-polymer blend of toluene diisocyanate mixed isomers (TDI) as one of the raw materials. The TDI pre-polymer is received in tank trucks which pressure unloads the material into an unload tank.  The unload tank is filled only when empty.  The pre-polymer is transferred to a storage tank on an as needed basis.  If a foam formulation calls for the addition of the pre-polymer, the line operator enters that information into the process controller.  The line operator must then enable an auto-fill feature of the run tank and an automatic valve on a recirculating loop will open so that the pre-polymer can fill the run tank.  From there, the pre-polymer is chilled and pumped to the mixing head station on the foam line.  The TDI pre-polymer reacts with other components and is deposited on a carrier as polyurethane foam.\r\n\r\nRelease scenarios: In accordance with RMP reporting requirement changes, our Worst Case and two Alternate scenarios are only contained within Sections 2 & 3. \r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific steps: The facility takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\no Sa"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:  Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases of TDI that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our pre-polymer TDI, the on-site trained Hazwoper Team will respond to small spills.  In the event of a larger spill, it is the facility policy to notify our contract emergency spill response company and request that they respond to the situation. \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  The following is a list of improvements that will be implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases\r\n-Include consequences of deviations in operating procedures\r\n-Improve the emergency response plan to include a description of information to be communicated during an emergency & identify the responsible person for notifying regulatory agencies along with the media\r\n-Increase the frequency of incident investigation training for leaders"
