      "SummaryText": "Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AECI's) New Madrid Power Plant, consisting of two coal fired 600-MW electric generation units.  In 1999 and 2000, New Madrid Power Plant installed two Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce NOx emissions. These systems require approximately 3600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per hour each day per unit; 7200 pounds per hour each day for the facility.   Onsite storage of anhydrous ammonia will not exceed 1.35 mil. pounds stored in four each, 80,000-gallon tanks.  NMPP has six (6) NH3 storage tanks; however, only four (4) tanks are in service at time. The remaining two tanks are kept empty with only NH3 vapor pressure to be used for emergency purposes.\n\nThe RMP relies on the facility Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the anhydrous ammonia system. The PSM program includes employee training in operations, maintenance and emergency response procedures. The facility maintains an on-site Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is trained and refreshed annually to the HAZ-MAT Technician Level. The facility is also involved with the applicable LEPCs. The on-site ERT is trained and equipped to be able to respond in Level A chemical HAZ-MAT suits with SCBA for emergency response in the event of an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\nNew Madrid Power Plant is following the PSM and RMP programs. Prevention and emergency response procedures are in place to prevent or mitigate the potential for anhydrous ammonia releases. Passive and active mitigation systems are in place to prevent or minimize a loss of primary containment.   \n\nThe New Madrid Power Plant last compliance audit was performed in June 2021. In April 2019, New Madrid Power Plant performed a HAZOP Process Hazard Analysis study of the Anhydrous Ammonia process.  The New Madrid Power Plant conducted the required re-validation of the PHA performed in March 2024. \n\nIn the 5 years previous to the submission of this RMP, there have been no accidental release events that resulted"
