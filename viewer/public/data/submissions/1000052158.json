The plan is also exercised in house on an annual basis.\r\nIn order to assist in the evacuation of affected areas and the containment of a release, White Mills Treatment Plant maintains certain equipment on site. A large siren is mounted on the roof of the facility to warn the local area in the event of a chlorine leak. An onsite weather center is available to determine wind speed and direction for more accurate estimating of the affected area. A repair kit for ton chlorine cylinders is maintained on site for the response team to repair damaged containers. Emergency escape packs are available for employees to safely evacuate the facility.\r\nSince the White Mills Treatment Plant has been in operation (October 1990), there have been no accidental releases of chlorine. We feel this is in part due to the written operating procedures, employee training, and aggressive preventative maintenance program administered by Hardin County Water District No. 2. In our efforts to protect the public, the environment, and our employees, Hardin County Water District No. 2 will continue to review our operating procedures, continue to adequately train new employees, continue to require refresher training for all experienced employees, and continue with an aggressive preventative maintenance program."

      "SummaryText": "ystem where all venting goes through a scrubber system.  All tanks and piping are located behind a containment wall in a separate climate controlled room.  The location isolates the process from any vehicular traffic as well as normal personnel traffic.  A very sensitive ammonia detector is located within the room which provides an audible and visual alarm in the event of a release.  \r\nOther measures taken to assure the safety of both processes are strict operating procedures, an overall safety program, and preventative maintenance program. Each operator is required to know and follow the process operating procedures. Along with the operating procedures, Hardin County Water District No. 2 also employs a companywide safety program. Safety training is part of the program, which includes training topics such as chlorine safety, ammonia safety, and hazard communication. As part of the safety program, rewards are given to employees for maintaining good safety records; this gives employees an incentive to follow safety procedures.\r\nPreventative maintenance is one of the most important parts of maintaining a process in a safe and efficient manner. White Mills Treatment Plant has a preventative maintenance program that includes the chlorine and ammonia process. The maintenance program addresses regular inspections of all chlorine and ammonia equipment, annual overhaul of chlorinators and vacuum regulators, regular replacement of critical components, and assurance of a clean supply of chlorine from the chlorine manufacturer. The maintenance technician has the experience to recognize potential problems with both processes and make adjustments if necessary. All of the operators are also trained to perform regular inspections and follow all process procedures.\r\nThe White Mills Treatment Plant is required to comply with the OSHA PSM rule as well as State and Local emergency response requirements. Our facility currently has a written emergency response plan, which is filed with t"

      "SummaryText": "regulating valves will shut down the flow of chlorine. A sensitive spring-diaphragm device is designed to contain gas under pressure. The system also contains an additional spring-diaphragm check valve designed to confine the gas should the first valve stick due to dirt buildup on the seat.\r\nAnother safety consideration is the location of the process. The chlorine supply and equipment are maintained in a room, which is separate from the rest of the facility and always remains locked. Although the room is not airtight and would not prevent the release of gas into the atmosphere, it would considerably slow the escape of an accidental release of chlorine gas. The separate room also protects the process from fire and unnecessary traffic from employees and prevents access from unauthorized personnel. The room is equipped with a chlorine gas detector that provides a bright, red, flashing, light along with an audible horn throughout the plant in the event of a chlorine leak. The detector is very sensitive and able to detect very small amounts of chlorine gas, which would make operators aware of a leak at its earliest stage. Other safety measures include strict operating procedures which includes specific hours for deliveries.  Since a chlorine leak would most likely occur during chlorine deliveries or during the handling of chlorine cylinders, these procedures are required to be done only during the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. This would allow for quicker response from all agencies in the unlikely event of an accidental release. It would also allow for easier notification to public. \r\nThe ammonia process was added in 2015 as a new process used in the formation of a chloramine disinfectant.  The process includes two 2500 gallon bulk storage tanks which hold a 29% solution of aqueous ammonia.  The ammonia solution is transferred from the two tanks to a day tank where the solution is then pumped into the treatment process.  The process is a closed s"

      "SummaryText": "White Mills Treatment plant is a water treatment facility that is owned and operated by Hardin County Water District No. 2. The treatment plant began operation as a new facility in October of 1990 and now provides drinking water to over 50,000 people in Hardin, Larue, and Hart Counties. The facility has a capacity to produce 8.1 million gallons of water each day using coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. The disinfection process requires the use of chlorine gas and aqueous ammonia, which are the processes covered under this risk management program.\r\nThe chlorine is fed through four chlorine ejectors from two - one ton chlorine cylinders at an average rate of170 lbs per day. Each chlorinator has the capacity to feed up to 150 lbs of chlorine per day. There are three chlorine cylinders maintained on site, each of which contains up to 2000 lbs of chlorine. Two of the cylinders are continuously connected to a pair of vacuum regulators that control the flow of chlorine from the cylinders to the chlorinators. The third cylinder is either an empty cylinder waiting to be picked up by the supplier or a full cylinder on standby waiting to replace a cylinder in service that becomes empty. As a user of chlorine, Hardin County Water District No. 2 understands the importance of safety when it comes to the use of such a dangerous product. Safety was a consideration when the plant was originally designed and when the equipment was selected and installed. The chlorine equipment used today is considered some of the best equipment in the industry. The same equipment is being chosen for new processes and as a replacement for old processes. The system is an all-vacuum operation, which reduces gas pressure from the cylinders to a vacuum. The vacuum regulator valves are mounted directly to the ton container valves and all lines and components carrying gas beyond that point are not under pressure. This means that if there is a loss of vacuum for any reason, the vacuum"
