The Peru Facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps designed to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and provide a well-trained work force. The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals. The Peru Facility coordinates emergency response activities primarily with the City of Peru Fire Department. In addition, in an actual emergency, the City of LaSalle Fire Department, LaSalle County LEPC, and other sources of emergency response may be called on to provide mutual aid. The Peru Facility assists local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data sheets for participating companies. Since its certification in November 1993, the Peru Facility has been a participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n\n\n2.Regulated Substances.\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility manufactures polystyrene-based products consisting of one main process area where expandable polystyrene (EPS) is produced and a tank farm where the regulated substance is stored. The polymers are produced in a batch process. The Peru Facility has one RMP-regulated substance, Flammable Mixture (flammable liquid), at the facility. The Flammable Mixture is impregnated inside the polystyrene to cause the beads to expand when heated by the end user.\n\n\n\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that the Peru Facility has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined b"

This includes information pertaining to:\n\n\n\nHazards of regulated substances: For each applicable substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n\n\n\nThe technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n\n\n\nEquipment in the process: Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility has performed process hazard analysis on each covered process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards. The Peru Facility utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process. The Peru Facility assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process. The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are to be implemented within a reasonable period of time.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators, designed to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.

The training emphas safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices. Operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program. The program is comprised of trained personnel who are to follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures designed to ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process. The procedures are designed such that, prior to any change, the following issues are to be considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements. Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are to be informed of and trained in the change. If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are to be updated.\n\n\n\nPRE START-UP SAFETY REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility performs pre start-up safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

Teams comprised of employees and/or consultants with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility investigates incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals. The investigation is to be promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident. To perform the investigation, the Peru Facility has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation. The Peru Facility has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution. Finally, incident reports are to be reviewed with all affected personnel.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility has developed a written action plan for employee participation designed to cover all aspects of its process safety management program.

If hot work is to be performed near a covered process, the Peru Facility issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed. Hot work permits are to be kept on file until the work is complete.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe Peru Facility has developed procedures for selecting contractors that are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work. The Peru facility provides information to them about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed safe work practices. The Peru Facility also evaluates the safety performance and programs of the contractors as a part of their continued employment.\n\n\n\n4.
