Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Phoenix Distribution Center are committed to operating the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with the highest regard for the safety of the public, distribution center personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, distribution center personnel, and the environment the facility has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk management Program rule 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the facilities management system specifically address the prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia and emergency response to an accidental release.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source, Regulated Substance Handled, and Process Description\n\n1.  The Phoenix Distribution Center is located at 1115 W. Alameda Drive, Tempe AZ.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the closed loop mechanical refrigeration system.  \n\n2. The ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the facility which is subject to the EPA rule and OSHA PSM standard.  \n\n3. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance in the ammonia refrigeration system.  At ambient temperature and pressure it is a colorless gas with an irritating odor.  It is highly soluble in water.  The chemical formula for anhydrous ammonia is NH3.\n\n4. The anhydrous ammonia maximum intended inventory is 45,575 lbs.\n\n5. The closed loop mechanical refrigeration system cycles the refrigerant (anhydrous ammonia) from liquid to gas and back again.  The ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the process.  The system cycles the ammonia through various physical states, high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, high pressure vapor, and low pressure vapor in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \n\n \n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has an accidental release "

Five Year Accident History\n\nOver the past five years, the Eastern Distribution Center has not had any anhydrous ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan is detailed in the in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM Document and in the Business Plan for the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injures\n\n3. To protect the environment\n\n4. To minimize property damage\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly area, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  If a release of ammonia were to occur the facility will determine the extent of the emergency.  supervisors will contact employees in their departments to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting area.  The public address system and blow horns will be used in the event that individual contact cannot be made.  Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the Phoenix Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the release.  All employees are trained annually in the emergency evacuation/response plan.  This  Plan is reviewed and updated at least "
