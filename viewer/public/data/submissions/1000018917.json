If an accident should accur, the facility is prepared to work with the Buda Fire Department, Bureau County Local Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 7226 IL RT. 40 Buda IL. 61314, is the storage and distribution of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage ans handling system consits of (2) 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading riser, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored woulod be 680,000 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worse case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worse case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over a 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the larggest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 014mg/L for the worse case scenario is 2.7 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the closing of the tank valves, was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of product release.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is 0.30 miles.

Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergancy Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\nA written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\nProvided state and local authorities the emergancy planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nIn the event of emergancy involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Bradford Fire Department and Bureau County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergancy. Our emergancy action plan have been coordinated with both the fire departmnet and the LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenace of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementaion at this time."
