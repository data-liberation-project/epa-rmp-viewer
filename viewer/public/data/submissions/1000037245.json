      "SummaryText": "The Red Hills Gas Processing Plant is a new greenfield facility that begin operations in Mary 2013.    Because it is a new startup, actual operations may be delayed due to unforeseen equipment failures upon initial startup. Since this is a new Agave facility, there is no accident history to report.\n\n\n\nThe operation of the Red Hills Gas Processing Plant is intended to process 60 MMSCFD of gas.  The gas will be treated to remove acid gas components, dehydrated to remove water and processed to remove heavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream.  Several plant systems will be involved to perform these functions.  The acid gas that is removed by the amine unit will be disposed of by either acid gas injection into a disposal well or by venting depending on the constituents present.   The cryogenic unit is designed to liquefy natural gas liquids from the sweet, dehydrated inlet gas by removing work (heat) from the gas be means of the turbo expander. The cryogenic unit recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) by cooling the gas stream to extremely cold temperatures (-130?F) and condensing components such as ethane, propane, butanes and heavier.  It is the presence of these flammable NGL that cause the facility to be subject to the OSHA PSM process and thus the RMP process.\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the units with the largest amount of NGL (5 NGL storage tanks) had either a catastrophic failure (worse case scenario) or a small leak (alternative scenario).  The flammable material is composed of a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane.  For both the worse case and alternative scenario, the mixture was assumed to be composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage, i.e. highest heat of combustion or pooling factor.\n\n\n\nThe Red Hills Gas Processing Plant is an OSHA PSM facility and as such is subject to 29 CFR 1910.119.  In addition, the facility is subject to 29 CFR 1910.120 (HazWhoper), 29 CFR 19"

Specific practices that are important to Agave's prevention program include a rigorous maintenance program, ongoing safety training, compliance audits, incident investigation, written operating procedures, and process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\nAgave Energy Company has provided onsite tours of the facility to local fire and rescue departments.  Agave has also provided such entities with a written emergency action plan.  Facility personnel are trained in several aspects of emergency response including the proper use of facility SCBA's, fire extinguishers, and H2S safety.  It is Agave's intent that regularly scheduled drills be held to ensure that the facility personnel are aware to the emergency action plan.  In addition, the emergency response plan will be reviewed semi-annual with facility personnel and appropriate changes made.  \n\n\n\nAgave is committed to the gathering and processing of natural gas. Our corporate objectives are to continually increase capacities while minimizing our costs, preventing significant impact to the environment, and protecting the health and safety of employees and the public.\n\n\n\nAgave is committed to complying with all existing and relevant safety and environmental laws and regulations. Agave will continue to commit resources to the pursuit of fair interpretation of existing laws and enactment of future laws based on sound science and economic reality.\n\n\n\nAgave continually considers new technologies, systems, and methods of organization that enhance its ability to achieve these business, safety and environmental objectives and periodically reviews its goals to ensure that the needs of employees and the public are addressed.\n\n"
