The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facilities workers, and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility operates two biomass-fired electricity generating units.  Unit 1 is designed to generate 30 MW gross (28 MW net) of electrical power, while Unit 2 is designed to generate 25 MW gross (21 MW net) of electrical power.  The plant burns agricultural, wood fuels, and other crop wastes in fluidized bed boilers to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.\n\nAmmonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in the boiler flue gas. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received at the plant via liquefied-gas truck and stored in a single 30,000 gallon capacity tank.\n\nThere is a daily maximum of 132,000 lbs of ammonia at the facility.\n\n3a\tWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a 30,000 gallon (Water Capacity) pressure storage tank of ammonia.  Failure of this container will release 132,000 lbs of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire 132,000 lbs is released as gas in ten minutes.  The ammonia storage tank is located outside of any structure or building.\n\n3b.\tAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for the covered process was determined to be the result of an undetected hole in the temporarily connected liquid filling hose from the tanker delivery vehicle to the ammonia storage tank.  It is e"

The estimated duration of this event is fifteen minutes.\n\n3c.\tAdministrative Control\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur, and preferably not to have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedure for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia system operators.\n\n3d.\tMitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur, and preferably not to have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are base upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and related components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of facilities main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases occurred within the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facilityand await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  Kern County incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  Commitments were made under the S"
