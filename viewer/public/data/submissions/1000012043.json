This prevention program covers the K4M resin manufacturing process which utilizes Kettle 4 (K4M).  The manufacturing process is a stepwise batch process using controlled amounts of chemcials reacting in the kettle to produce a formaldehyde based resin.  The process utilizes transfer lines from storage areas to deliver the chemicals.  The piping is considered to be part of this process.",

This policy is for us the basis trust between Arclin and our stakeholders.\nWe will\n-ensure that health and safety are our first priority;\n-minimize harmful environmental impacts;\n-base our work on openness and continuous improvement;\n-develop products, services and operations with consistent quality, which are environmentally preferred and safe;\n-implement this policy according to the agreed health, safety, environmental and quality management system based on ISO or equivalent standards.\n\nWe are committed to comply with applicable governmental laws and regulations and to meet the requirements of other organizations to which we subscribe.\n\nOur employees are our most important asset, and an integral part of the success of our environmental, health and safety programs.  We will properly train, equip and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nWe will review our performance against our objective and targets and update the Environmental Management System as appropriate.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activities at Arclin USA are the manufacture of formaldehyde and specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is one of several ingredients, but the only substance regulated under 40 CFR 68.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\nThe worst case release would be the result of a broken transfer line during kettle charging with the rupture occurring outside the tank storage containment area. The maximum quantity released would be 125,000 gallons of solution that is 54% by weight formaldehyde at a spill rate of 400 gallons per minute.  The maximum quantity released to the atmosphere assuming an initial spill temperatu"

The potential distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.012 mg/liter) is 1.8 miles.  \n\nThe alternative scenario for formaldehyde would be the release of 3,700 lbs of formaldehyde from a transfer line failure.  The maximum quantity released to the atmosphere assuming an initial spill temperature of 65 degrees C would be 0.73 lbs/minute.  It is estimated that the release would be stopped by an employee in no more than five minutes.  The potential distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.31 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Arclin are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM-required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Arclin program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP issues.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nArclin has had no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nArclin has established a facility emergency repsonse plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedure for informing the public and local emergency agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.
