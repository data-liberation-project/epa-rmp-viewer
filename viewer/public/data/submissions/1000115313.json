      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n1.1 Program Overview\nCold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg has developed and is implementing a consolidated program to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\u0095\tTitle 40 CFR Part 68\u0097EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program\n\u0095\tTitle 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\u0097OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management Program\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) program has fourteen (14) major program elements. The Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA) risk management program (RMP) has the same major fourteen (14) program elements, but also has additional requirements for offsite consequence analyses and risk management plan submissions. Since the requirements in these two (2) regulations have substantial crossover, Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg has elected to develop and implement one (1) consolidated program to meet the requirements of both regulations. This consolidated program is referred to as the RMP/PSM program. \n\n1.2 Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg RMP/PSM Program Philosophy\nCold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg is not developing and implementing the RMP/PSM program to simply \u0093check a box\u0094 or avoid regulatory penalties. Rather, Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg is committed to promoting the overall safety and health of employees, contractors, and visitors onsite. Furthermore, Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg has a duty to protect people and the environment in the surrounding community. Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg management and employees understand that a properly developed and implemented RMP/PSM program will help avoid accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. While Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg, works hard to serve their clients, nothing takes precedence over maintaining the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "located in Ellisville, MS which is twenty (20) miles north of Hattiesburg. In order to keep product at the desired temperature, Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg utilizes an industrial closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. This ammonia refrigeration system is considered one (1) covered process having an ammonia inventory of approximately 30,000 lbs. Appendix A to Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 lists the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #: 7664-41-7) as 10,000 lbs. Since the quantity of the Ammonia Refrigeration System exceeds this quantity, it is subject to OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management standard found in Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119.\n\nThe list of substances provided in Title 40 CFR \u00a768.130 also lists the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #: 7664-41-7) as 10,000 lbs. Since the quantity of the Ammonia Refrigeration System exceeds this quantity, it is subject to EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program standard found in Title 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nFinally, the Program Level of the covered process needed to be determined. Since the worst-case release scenario for the Ammonia Refrigeration System would affect public receptors, it is not eligible for Program 1. Further, since the Ammonia Refrigeration System is subject to Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119 it is not eligible for Program 2. The result is that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is subject to Program 3 requirements.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nWhile Cold-Link Logistics Hattiesburg has a thorough RMP/PSM policy, a description of the requirements associated with each program element are summarized in the sections below.\n\n3.1 Hazard Assessment\nCoordinate with a consultant to complete a Hazard Assessment initially, every five (5) years, and if a change necessitates it.
