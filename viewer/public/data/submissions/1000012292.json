The Merck Stonewall emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each covered chemical at the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nb.  Merck Sharp & Dohme Corporation is a worldwide research-intensive health products company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human and animal health products.  Merck Sharp & Dohme Stonewall Plant, located near Elkton, Virginia, was established in 1941.  Currently, the plant employs approximately 780 people in a range of pharmaceutical manufacturing activities such as fermentation, solvent extraction, organic chemical synthesis and finishing and packaging operations.  The facility's products include broad spectrum antibiotics, an antifungal drug, anti-parasitic drugs for human and animal health, a cholesterol lowering drug and medicines for the treatment of the human papilloma virus, asthma, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  The production of the two latter products requires the use of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is charged to process vessels from either railcar or tube trailer.\n\nc.  The Stonewall accidental release prevention program is based on the following process safety management key elements including:\n*     Aggressive and thorough Hazard Analysis (HazOp) performed on all processes\n*     Process specific and safety training for operators\n*     Use of best industry practice for safe handling of highly toxic and hazardous materials \n*     Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\n*     Implementation of both a corporate and local audit program\n*     Preventative and predictive maintenance program\n*     Fully trained and active site emergency response team\n*     Contractor safety program\n\nChemical specific pre"

No accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride meeting the definition of 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\ne.  The facility has an emergency response program, including an on site emergency response team, Hazardous Materials Team, Fire & Rescue Brigades and an Emergency Medical Services Team.  The facility has a mutual aid agreement with the Rockingham County Fire and Rescue Department, which is a member of the LEPC.  This agreement extends the service of the facility's emergency response program teams to the community in the event that additional assistance or equipment is needed.  This program includes emergency response guidelines and procedures for each covered chemical and a notification plan.  Emergency response drill evaluations are typically conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.  Additionally, a reverse 911 system continues to be operated and maintained by the LEPC.  This system has been coordinated with the Emergency 911 Center such that dispatchers can highlight the area in which emergency notifications are needed and activate the system to automatically call residents in the affected area to inform them of emergency situations.  In order to more quickly notify nearby neighbors as well as those on the facility, a shelter-in-place siren has been installed at the facility to provide warning of events requiring shelter-in-place.   \n\nf. The aforementioned emergency response program teams have numerous training programs planned for 2010.  This training is determined using the criteria set by the Virginia Department of Fire Programs and all team members are required to achieve the competencies outlined in National Fire Protection Association Standards 1001, 1002, 1500, 472 and 1670.
