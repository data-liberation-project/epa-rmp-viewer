      "SummaryText": "September 18, 2009\nTo whom it may concern,\n     The City of Glenwood Springs Water Treatment Facility currently utilizes chlorine gas ( 100% ) in the disinfection process. We store a minimum of 6,000 pounds of this material on site at any given time. As I included in the original Risk Management Plan ( 1999 ) I programmed in 8,000 pounds but we have reduced the amount on site after reviewing our plant operations and will be able to schedule chemical deliveries more often so we won't have as much on site.\n     For many years the City of Glenwood Springs has had, what we feel are adequate precautionary measures in place to assist in offsetting the possibility of a major chlorine gas release. Our plan has been subject to some modifiactions over the years in order to improve it. We recently were exposed to a wildfire situation in 2002 where it became necessary to remove the cylinders from the site and relocate them elsewhere in order to protect the public and fire personnel. This transition went very well in the transportation of the cylinders during the emergency and the return to normal operations without any leaks or major events. The City of Glenwood Springs has never experienced any type of gas release into the atmoshere. Other than our in-house procedures at the Water Treatment Facility, we rely heavily on State and Local ( Glenwood Springs Fire Department ) agencies because we are a small entity. \n     I would like to briefly explain how our response would be in the event of even a minor release at the facility.\n     The Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a chlorine sensing device located in the chlorine process / storage area. This sensing device is tested every week by releasing a small amount of chlorine gas ( created by mixing bleach & vinegar ). The chlorine sensing device is also equipped with a separate backup power supply ( UPS ) in case of a power outage. This UPS is also tested under a load every week.\n     In the chlorine process / storage area the"

      "SummaryText": "re is always 2 one ton cylinders on the scales hooked up to the chlorine feed equipment at any given time. We have the capability of storing a total of 4 one ton cylinders in this area but as mentioned earlier I have reduced the inventory to 3 total.\n     Upon detection of chlorine gas at a concentration of 3 ppm in the atmoshere within the process / storage area, it engages an alrm which initiates a signal to the Chlorine Scrubber system and a signal to the in-plant Fire Communicator. The Chlorine Scrubber system will operate to neutralize the leak ( as much as 1 full ton cylinder ) until the \"On Call\" operator / Fire Department shuts the system down after the problem has been corrected. The in-plant Fire Communicator will automatically dial out to an alarm monitoring service which in turn contacts the local dispatch to page the Glenwood Springs Fire Department \n( GSFD ) and the Glenwood Springs Police Department ( GSPD ). The dialer pages out the \"On Call\" operator as well. All parties meet at a designated site as police units seal off certain identified areas around the plant. Once the plant operator and the GSFD evaluate the situation, they proceed to the Water Treatment Plant. The GSFD provides the back up for the operator. After they suit up in their Self Contained Breathing Apparatus(s) ( SCBA ) the operator enters the chlorine area to isolate / repair the leak. In the event of the worst case scenario, the GSFD, GSPD, and State HAZMAT departments would address the situation as per the Emergency Response Plan in place.\n     There have been a few false alarms call outs where this plan has been tested and it seems to be adequate. The Glenwood Springs Fire Department has also initiated mock tests in the past and the plan seems to be in proper order. The Glenwood Springs Fire Department has been involved in cases where there has been chlorine gas releases at swimming pools in the area and their plan seems to work well. The only thing that we lack is an actual majo"

      "SummaryText": "r chlorine gas release to test our plan which we hope never happens.\n     We have an in-house training program the includes the monthly training on the SCBA, rotation of chlorine cylinder changeovers, and loading / offloading of the chemical. In addition to this we attend seminars as they become available to us. We have also began to include some additional training in the form of refresher courses through Chlorine Consultants, Inc. The training is an 8 hour refresher course that the plant operators personnel attend annually. I try to send rotating operators to this seminar. We began attending this training in 1998.\n     We have a very aggressive maintenance program on all of our plant equipment especially the equipment associated with the feeding, handling, testing of chlorine gas or residual. Equipment in the chlorine area includes but is not limited to the chlorine detector system that includes a backup power source, weighing scales, chlorinators, chlorine scrubber system, and chlorine lifting bar assembly.\n     The City of Glenwood Springs feels that the safety of the public and its employees is of the utmost importance and we strive to improve our plan and encourage any constructive criticism reagrding this plan.\n     If you have any questions regarding this plan or find it necessary to obtain more information, please feel free to contact me by phone ( 970-384-6345 ) or by e-mail at jerry.wade@cogs.us.\n\n\n                                                                                                    Thank You,\n\n\n                                                                                                    Jerry K.
