      "SummaryText": "Introduction:  The City of Junction City, Kansas is served by a 10-million gallon per day design water treatment plant, which is owned by the City and operated by Veolia Water North America.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers Section 112r regulated substances maintained at the Junction City Water Treatment Plant, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.\r\nPlant Description:  The Plant maintains only one regulated substance on site: chlorine.  Maximum chlorine storage is 12,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The storage and management of chlorine are addressed in this RMP.  The Plant is located at 2101 N. Jackson, Junction City, Kansas, which is an urban area.  The surrounding area contains some small housing developments, and the downtown area of Junction City is approximately one mile from the Plant. Process Hazard Assessment: A process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine system beginning with cylinder unloading and ending with the chlorine in solution.  A checklist and modified \"What if\" analysis were used.  In the checklist analysis, general questions regarding the storage and use areas, as well as protocols associated with the management of the chlorination system, were answered.  A copy of the checklist is included in the plan.  Following the checklist, each valve, line and piece of equipment in the system was assessed from the cylinder to point of chlorine injection using a system flow diagram.  The valves and other points in the system where chlorine could be released are numbered on the flow diagram.  The assessment is formatted in accordance with those numbers.  Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each point in the system.  Comments are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section.\r\nPrevention System: The Plant has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each e"

      "SummaryText": "lement of the chlorination system routinely.  There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on the system.  No work on the chlorine system is done without the Facilities Supervisor being present. At the beginning and end of the daily operating period, and as each cylinder is changed, the valves and piping are tested for leaks.  There are Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation.  The SOPs are written and posted in the appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  The system is equipped with new chlorine detectors in both the chlorine feed and storage rooms with a second detector now in the storage room; the monitoring system for the detectors was also updated.  Along with the new detectors and monitoring system an Automatic Valve Shut Offs mounted on the containers were installed.  They are actuated to close the chorine container valves if chlorine leak is detected; they can also be shut manually from emergency stop button located outside of chlorine rooms.  Ventilation is provided in the chlorine rooms only when a worker is present. \r\nEmergency Response Plan:  Plant personnel are allowed and trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by pressing the emergency stop button or by turning off a valve either manually.  Any response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by the Junction City and Fort Riley Fire Departments. The Plant has an agreement with the both Fire Departments, which is included in the Plan.  A complete copy of the Emergency Response Plan is also included in this Plan.\r\nAccident History:  The Plant has had no chlorine releases in the past five years.\r\nEquipment Replacement:  The Chlorine Feed System was upgraded in 2018 to modernize equipment"

      "SummaryText": "and replacement of all the pressurized piping to a vacuum system.  The Plant Operations Staff were included in the design and installation of the system so that their experience could be included and a thorough knowledge of the new system could be gained.  Several lessons from the past were incorporated in the new design including a simple industry standard set of equipment and an open architecture that makes operation, maintenance, and fault detection easily within the skill set of the staff.  \r\nSafety Programs:  Veolia Water North America and the operating staff take a commitment to the safety of the employees and the public served very seriously and has designed a safety training and audit program that includes safety training on at least a monthly basis.  The Treatment Plant received a nationally recognized safety achievement award in 2006.  The facility also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management program for this substance.  Veolia and the City of Junction City have partner closely to continue pursuing methods and equipment to improve the safe handling and storage of all on-site chemicals."
