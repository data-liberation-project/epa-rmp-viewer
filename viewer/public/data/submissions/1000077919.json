LACC has identified potential release scenarios and taken care to develop operating procedures to monitor and address potential releases as well as defined emergency response plans in the event that an incident occurs.\r\n\r\nLACC manufactures ethylene in an ethane cracking process.  The regulated substances handled above the reporting threshold include propylene, chlorine, ethylene, ethane, 1,3-butadiene, butane, butene, pentane, propane, and methane.  \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are addressed in LACC's programs and procedures.  The LACC prevention program includes site procedures related to mechanical integrity, employee participation, hot-work permitting, and contractor management.  Operating procedures have been developed and management of change procedures track changes that may affect any process safety information, process hazard analysis, and / or operating procedures.  A pre-startup safety review is also conducted per the site procedure to ensure the site processes are adhered to and employees and / or contractors are trained on the process they will come in contact with.  LACC has site procedures to address routine compliance audits and evaluations against site procedures and will conduct third-party audits every three years, as required.   In the event an incident does occur, a site incident investigation procedure is utilized to look at the root cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to be implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of a related incident.\r\n\r\nAs the facility is a newly constructed unit, LACC has no five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nLACC has an emergency respons"
