By virtue of the flammable characteristics associated with the propane and commercial butane present at the facility, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these materials to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby businesses and members of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Safety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle propane as well as on the various safety devices incorporated into the design of our equipment.  Futhermore, comprehensive training received by our employees adds to the inherent safety of our distribution facility.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the National Propane Gas Association's LP-Gas Safety Handbook/\"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures/How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires\"..  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of propane or commercial butane, if a release does occur, the facility has a  coordinated remergency response program that includes interface with the Fire Marshall, the County emergency agency,and a cooperative business mutual aid society (PSMA).  These written programs and coordination provide a  high level of emergency training to private and public  response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to receive, store and redistribute propane and a commercial butane mixture to wholesale customers.  The flammable products arrive at our facility via pipeline, rail car, or transport trucks.  The facility has severa"

Larger volumes of propane and commercial butane are stored in underground storage caverns via liquid storage wells operated by the Petal product handling terminal.  The two products are redelivered to to whlesale customers for transport via pipeline, rail car or transport truck.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, maintenance contractors, transport truck drivers and rail car switching personnel..\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are propane and a commercial mixed butane product which varies in compostion depending upon the original source of the product.  Most of the liquids stored at the facility are kept in underground liquid product storage wells.  A relatively pure liquid ethane product is also handled by the Petal storage facility.  The ethane is received from DOT regulated pipelines, sent to storage in an underground liquid storage well, and is returned to DOT regulated pipelines from storage.  The ethane stored at Petal is in storage incident to DOT pipeline transportation, exempt from the EPA Risk Management Program regulation.  Up to 1,200 gallons of ethyl mercaptan is also stored at the facility for use as an odorant in rail car and transport truck propane shipments.  The quatity of ethyl mercaptan in storage is at all times less than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified in the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with (NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition/NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition).\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\n\nHattiesburg NGL Stora"

The reviews focus on operating procedures, equipment functions and handling practices to identify possible hazards.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are revalidated periodically.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hattiesburg NGL Storage maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\n\nHattiesburg NGL Storage has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided periodically as needed.  \n\nMaintenance\n\nHattiesburg NGL Storage carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functioning.   Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in these practices.  Furthermore, personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nHattiesburg NGL Storage conducts audits on a regular basis "

      "SummaryText": "to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nHattiesburg NGL Storage promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of propane.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nHattiesburg NGL Storage has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  There was one incident in the last five years that involved an empty insulated railroad tank car that began leaking a small amount of product about half way through the loading process.  Facility staff quickly shut down, isolated and began to empty the railroad car to limit the amount of flammable product that would escape.  Although County emergency responders shut down the nearby highway and rail line, and evacuated some nearby residents as a precautioin, the ambient hydrocarbon levels near the leaking railroad car did not exceed 20% of the lower flammability limit on hand held hydrocarbon detectors.  The reported incident did not involve any equipment, material or procedure deficiencies under the control of the Petal terminal management or operating technicians.    \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nHattiesburg NGL Storage carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental release of propane.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment,  evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nOur facility's emergency response plan is based upon"

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEnterprise Petal product handling terminal has an ongoing operations safety program which has a goal of eliminating all accidents, and, should this goal fail, insuring a prompt response to any incident to reduce or mitigate the possible consequences to terminal employees, nearby facilities, or the general public.  This program includes the periodic review and revalidation of the location Process Hazard Analysis, and prompt action to address safety action items recommended by the review team.  As part of the location's ongoing effot to improve the safety of the design and operation of the product handling terminal, the folloiwing projects are currently planned to improve the facility safety.\n\n*  Improvements to the facility auctomatic control and position indication of installed safety shutdown valves.\n*  Installation of a new flare tip with a smokeless flare system and air blower to improve combustion of vented hydrocarbons\n*  A new computer based system is being implemented to improve the facility mechanical integrity program\n*  A project is planned to upgrade the location electrical switchgear to improve the terminal operating reliability.\n*  The terminal has a long range plan to improve overall facility security."
