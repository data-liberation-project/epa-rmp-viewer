It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\r\nregulated substances. Such releases are not foreseeable but our plans are fully coordinated with the highly\r\ntrained emergency response personnel at the Springfield Fire Department to control and mitigate the\r\neffects of any releases.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\r\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. All of the ammonia inventory is used as a\r\nrefrigerant.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements\r\nset out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under\r\n29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
