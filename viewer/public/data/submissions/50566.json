              "Description": "Both Processes 1 and 2, the LPG Bullet Tank and the five LSR Bullet Tanks, are eligible for Prevention Program Level 3.  Program 3 impose prevention program requirements, hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.\n\nWorst-case release analyses were performed for the Thomas Refinery as discusses in detail in the Executive Summary and under the Flammable Substances Worst Case and Alternative Release Sections.  The distance to endpoint for the LPG tank was determined to be 0.4 miles which affects one residence.  The distance to endpoint for the LSR tank was determined to be 1.0 mile which affects one residence.      \n\nThe Thomas Refinery has not had an accidental release in the past five years that led to death, injury, or responders or restoration activities for exposure to a receptor because the facility has been closed.  \n\nAccording to topographic maps of the area surrounding the Thomas Refinery there is one residence within the 0.4 and 1.0 mile radii that will be affected by a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nThis RMP must be certified by the owner, operator, or senior official with management responsibility for the person(s) completing the RMP.  Program Level 3 requires certification that no additional preventive steps are required to maintain compliance with the RMP rule.\n\nIn an emergency situation, the Thomas Refinery employees are aware and trained in the proper escape and evacuation procedures.  Currently, Operators A are the operators of the Thomas Refiner that may be on-site during an emergency situation.",

Program 3 impose prevention program requirements, hazard assessment, management, and emergency response requirements.\n\nWorst-case release analyses were performed for the Thomas Refinery as discusses in detail in the Executive Summary and under the Flammable Substances Worst Case and Alternative Release Sections.  The distance to endpoint for the LPG tank was determined to be 0.4 miles which affects one residence.  The distance to endpoint for the LSR tank was determined to be 1.0 mile which affects one residence.      \n\nThe Thomas Refinery has not had an accidental release in the past five years that led to death, injury, or responders or restoration activities for exposure to a receptor because the facility has been closed.  \n\nAccording to topographic maps of the area surrounding the Thomas Refinery there is one residence within the 0.4 and 1.0 mile radii that will be affected by a vapor cloud explosion.  \n\nThis RMP must be certified by the owner, operator, or senior official with management responsibility for the person(s) completing the RMP.  Program Level 3 requires certification that no additional preventive steps are required to maintain compliance with the RMP rule.\n\nIn an emergency situation, the Thomas Refinery employees are aware and trained in the proper escape and evacuation procedures.  Currently, Operators A are the operators of the Thomas Refiner that may be on-site during an emergency situation.",

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Thomas Refinery is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors in the surrounding community and the environment.  This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Thomas Refinery is a small refinery which receives crude blend from well production.  The crude blend is fractionated into liquified petroleum gas (LPG), light straight run (LSR), intermediate naptha, heavy naptha, kerosene, diesel, and residue products.  All marketable products are trucked or pipelined out.  The only potential flammable mixtures with NFPA hazard ratings near 4 are the LPG and LSR products which are stored on site in pressurized tanks and contain ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and various hexanes in a mixture.  The worst case and alternative scenarios discussed in this plan calculate the endpoint distance for both flammable mixtures.  \n\nThe worst case scenarios for the LPG and LSR bullet tanks assume the capacity of the tanks are released in a vapor cloud explosion using the heats of combustion for each component of the mixture in accordance with EPA's RMP OCA Guidance.  The LSR tanks are located in such close pr"

      "SummaryText": "oximity, a vapor cloud explosion from one tank could trigger explosions from other tanks; therefore, the sum of each LSR tank?s capacity was used to determine the maximum weight of the LSR flammable mixture.  Since the heats of combustion for hexane plus is not included in the RMP guidance nor are they regulated substances they are assumed to be equal to the heat of combustion of pentane as they are potentially flammable.  The endpoint distances for the LPG and LSR processes are 0.4 miles and 1.0 miles, respectively.    \n\nThe alternative scenarios for the LPG and LSR bullet tanks assume a release occurs due to a process piping break resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  More specifically, both scenarios assume the release is due to a 2.5 inch valve failure (hole with circular diameter of 5 squared inches which is located in the liquid space of the tanks.  Both liquid and vapor space release calculations were performed in accordance with EPA's RMP OCA Guidance.  In both processes, if the valve failure was located in the liquid space of the tank(s), a larger release occurred resulting in a endpoint distance at the lower flammability limit of 36 (LFL of ethane - most conservative) at 0.1 miles for both processes.  \n\nThere are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals),   1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40 CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident "

      "SummaryText": "Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  Please see the Thomas Refinery Process Safety Management Program Guideline 301 Employee Participation for further information.   \n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the established safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.  Please see the Thomas Refinery Process Safety Management Program Guideline 701 Training for further information.   \n \nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area. Please see the Thomas Refinery Process Safety Management Program for further information.  \n \nThis facility has implemented a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.

      "SummaryText": "cedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program ensuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area. \n\n5 Year Accident History\nSince the Ventura Refinery has been idle for the previous five years and there have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances which resulted in offsite effects.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Ventura Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instructions for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures. Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs that are on the market today.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.  Please see the Thomas Refinery Safety Manual for further information.  \n\nThe RMP was submitted via the RMP*Submit software package on October 15, 2006."
