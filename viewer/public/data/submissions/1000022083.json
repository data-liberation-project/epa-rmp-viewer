Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  O. K. Foods strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual worker training, diligent equipment maintenance and the use of various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Heavener Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of poultry products.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tank.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility refrigeration maintenance personnel, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe EPA-regulated substance used at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 61,969 pounds.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIG"

      "SummaryText": "ATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of the largest receiver and a release of its entire contents in 10 minutes.   O. K. Foods policy restricts the carrying amount at any time to 80%of capacity, but for argument sake, the full amount being spilled has been examined.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor.  \nDistance to endpoint: 2.9 miles\nPopulation affected:  5,937\n\nAlternative Scenarios\nThe alternative scenarios investigated included all suggested release scenarios each with its consequential threat zone and population affected as indicated in Title 40 Part 68:28.  Scenarios investigated include:\n1.    Leaking transfer hose - Distance to endpoint: 1.0 miles.  Population affected = 1,340.  Quantity leaked = 2970 lbs/min X 360 min.\n\n2.    Process piping leak - Distance to endpoint: 0.1 miles.  Population affected = 0.  Quantity leaked = 24,000 lbs.\n\n3.    Vessel or pump leak due to crack or valve failure - Distance to endpoint: 0.3 miles.  Population affected = 79.  Total quantity leaked = 48,000 lbs.\n\n4.    Vessel over fill or over pressurization venting through a relief valve - Distance to endpoint:  0.6 miles.  Population affected = 363.  Quantity leaked = 48,000 lbs.\n\n5.    Shipping container mishandling or breakage leading to a spill.  Distance to endpoint = 1.6 miles.  Population affected = 3,136.  Quantity leaked = 33,605 lbs in one hour.\n\nIt has been determined that scenario 4 is the most likely to occur.\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nThis O. K. Foods facility has had no accidents or releases in the last five (5) years.\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Steven Chiamsachang, Plant Manager.  Mr. Chiamsachang will administrate in conjunction with the O. K. Foods management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Sequoyah County Local Emergency Planning Commit"

Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive combination of classroom and On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written and oral testing.  They are observed by senior maintenance staff and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge before they are permitted to conduct maintenance procedures on ammonia-containing equipment.  \n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nWe work very closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Muldrow Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.  Company personnel are fitted and trained in the use of emergency response protective equipment.  Guidelines for their use and the procedures for response are established.  An emergency contact chain has been developed and maintenance, security, safety, and environmental personnel meet regularly to review processes and procedures.   \n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n\nCurrently, O. K. Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  Our preventative maintenance program is above standard and our ammonia Process Safety Program is reviewed and updated annually.  Our program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available.\n\n"
