The Johnson Cooperative Grain Company, Inc. strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place. Our owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program. More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe Johnson Cooperative Grain Company, Inc. maintains and operates their Manter Anhydrous Ammonia Plant in strict accordance with all state and local authorities. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement. Changes or improvements in the facility's equipment will be acted upon immediately following the enforcement agency (KDA's) request, or as found to be necessary by our staff. \n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and employees are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses ammonia proof goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of emergency safety water during nurse tank and maintenance operations. \n\nWith the above-mentioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absolutely no injury accidents or property damage have occurred at this facility for the past 5 years.\n\nOur emergency action plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders. The Johnson Cooperative Grain Company, Inc. provides plant tour"
