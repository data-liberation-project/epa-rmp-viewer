Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n          The Wilson Lake Water Treatment Plant is strongly committed to employee, \n\n     public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive\n\n     accidental release prevention program in place that integrates areas such as design,\n\n     installation, management practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee\n\n     training associated with the chlorination process at our facility.  The chlorination system\n\n     at our plant is designed to meet industry standards and is well maintained.  Appropriate\n\n     controls and alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine. \n\n     Furthermore, all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\n     (EPA) Prevention Program Level 2 are adhered to.  \n\n          In the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the\n\n     Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments,\n\n     as well as, Harcross Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  These institutions provide\n\n     highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.   Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\n          Our facility is a publicly owned water treatment plant.  Our primary activity is\n\n     treating potable water and pumping it into the distribution system for public use.  We\n\n     provide water to the residents, businesses, and industries in Florence, Alabama and much\n\n     of Lauderdale County, AL.  We have one regulated substance, Chlorine.  Chlorine is used\n\n     for disinfecting the water.  The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 12,000\n\n     pounds.\n\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": " possible chlorine release scenarios, a \"worst case release\" and \"alternative\n\n     scenario\" were analyzed in accordance with EPA's RMP regulations.  To perform the\n\n     required scenario analyses for our facility, we used reference tables for the Area Locations\n\n     of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] model provided by the American Water Works\n\n     Association (AWWA).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n           The worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity of\n\n     chlorine in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified\n\n     failure.  Our largest vessel is a ton (2,000 pounds) container.  Neither passive nor active\n\n     mitigation was considered.  At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 m/s windspeed, and a\n\n     temperature of 101?F, a maximum distance of 3.04 miles is obtained corresponding to a\n\n     toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially affected residential population was\n\n     estimated to be approximately 19656.  Several public receptors and no environmental\n\n     receptors were identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\n\n\n          The alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine release is less severe and is \n\n     more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The scenario chosen involves\n\n     a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the\n\n     5/16 diameter valve body opening.  The total quantity released is 317 pounds with an\n\n     average release rate of 5.28 pounds per minute and a  maximum sustained release rate of\n\n     10.5 pounds per minute.  At class D atmospheric stability, a 3.0 m/s windspeed, and a\n\n     temperature of 101?F, a maximum distance of 0.57 miles is obtained corresponding to a\n\n     toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\n\n     Prevention Steps.\n\n\n\n          Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release\n\n     prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  The\n\n     following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is\n\n     in place at our facility.\n\n\n\n     Safety Information\n\n          Our facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical\n\n     hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the chlorine process.\n\n\n\n     Hazard Analysis\n\n          Our facility conducts a comprehensive overview and analysis of our chlorination\n\n     system to ensure that the associated hazards are identified and controlled efficiently.  The\n\n     methodology used to carry out this analysis is a hazard review checklist specifically\n\n     designed for water treatment plants.  This checklist was designed to meet the requirements\n\n     of The Chlorine Manual published by The Chlorine Institute.  The analyses are performed\n\n     by qualified personnel and are revalidated at  regular intervals.  Any findings related to\n\n     the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n     Operating Procedures\n\n          For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorination process, our\n\n     facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes\n\n     of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency\n\n     shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a change.  The\n\n     information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the\n\n     chlorination process.\n\n\n\n     Training\n\n          Our facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\n\n     employees who are operating the chl"

Process equipment examined by these checks\n\n     includes among others, ton containers, piping, chlorinators, vent systems, rotometers, and\n\n     ejectors.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous\n\n     training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the\n\n     maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\n     Compliance Audits\n\n          Our facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions\n\n     set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
