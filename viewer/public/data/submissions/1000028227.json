      "SummaryText": "1.0   Executive Summary\r\nLake Shore Mojave LLC owns but Lake Shore Energy Operations Group operates the Mojave Cogeneration Company in Boron, California.  The facility operates one Westinghouse aero-derivative combustion turbine generator (CTG) with a maximum nominal gross output of 53 megawatts (MW) (43 MW electricity plus 10 MW steam).  The CTG burns pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas exclusively.  It is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system and ammonia injection for the control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  Anhydrous ammonia is supplied to the SCR from a 12,000-gallon storage tank.  The working capacity of the tank is limited by administrative controls to 85 percent capacity, or approximately 10,200 gallons (approximately 52,428 pounds). \r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored and used at Lake Shore Mojave LLC of 61,680 pounds exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for regulation under the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 68), the 10,000-pound threshold for regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation (29 CFR 1910.112) and the 500-pound threshold for regulation under the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) RMP program.  Lake Shore Energy Operations Group has developed this plan to document the plans and programs Lake Shore Mojave LLC has in place to comply with these three regulatory programs.\r\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the Lake Shore Mojave LLC facility meets the requirements for a Program Level 3 facility under the federal and CalARP RMP programs, based on the storage of 12,000 gallons (61,680 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia, the potential to impact an off-site public receptor due to the worst-case release of ammonia from the process, and a release of ammonia within the last five years.  \r\nLake Shore Energy Operations Group has elected to develop a new combi"

The system has a NOx analyzer and ammonia flow controllers to regulate the flow of ammonia to the SCR.  The ammonia tank has redundant pressure relief valves to ensure safe operation of the tank.  The ammonia tank is a horizontally-oriented cylindrical tank.  The tank is constructed of carbon steel which is compatible with anhydrous ammonia.  The tank has a design capacity of 12,000 gallons, and is limited by administrative controls to an operating capacity of 10,200 gallons.  The tank is equipped with a deluge system that will flood the tank (externally) with copious amounts of water in the event of an ammonia release.  The tank is installed within a concrete containment structure that will contain up to 12,000 gallons of liquid.  A simplified process flow diagram is shown as Figure 1-1.

Equipment photographs are shown in Appendix A.\r\n1.5 Program Level 3 Prevention Program\r\n1.5.1 Process Safety Information\r\nLake Shore Mojave LLC relies on the chemical supplier for chemical safety information.  The ammonia supplier is Pacific Diazo, of Bakersfield, California.  A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia is included in Appendix B.  Regulatory citations for elements of the Program Level 3 Prevention Program are from 19 California Code of Regulations (CCR) \u00a72760.\r\n1.5.2 Process Hazards Analysis\r\nA team composed of Lake Shore Energy Operations Group and RMP engineers conducted a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) on May 2, 2012 for the anhydrous ammonia process at the facility.  The team consisted of individuals experienced in operation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system, hazards analysis, safety management, environmental health and safety issues, and performance of a PHA using appropriate techniques.  A complete description of the PHA process is provided in Section 4.0, and the PHA worksheets are provided in Appendix C.\r\nWhat-If approach was used to evaluate potential hazards in the ammonia system at the facility.  This approach is approved methodology for conducting a PHA under the CalARP, RMP and OSHA PSM programs.  The objective of these methodologies is to identify potential deviations from normal operating conditions that could lead to a release of a regulated substance.  \r\nThe PHA Team broke the ammonia process down into three nodes: unloading of ammonia, ammonia storage and delivery to the SCR, and general site hazards.  These nodes were broken down further into elements for evaluation.  Elements are usually individual components that could fail, such as a valve, pump, or hose.  \r\n1.5.3 Operating Procedures\r\nThe Lake Shore Energy Operations Group is a commercial power plant, and as such, has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all of the operations necessary to ensure safe and reliable operatio"

      "SummaryText": "hore Energy Operations Group has recently conducted a thorough 3-year RMP compliance audit, a thorough safety inspection of the ammonia tank and distribution system, and a comprehensive PHA for the ammonia process.  Lake Shore Energy Operations Group took corrective action immediately for each deficiency identified in these reviews. \r\nDuring the development of the OCA for this RMP / PSM, Lake Shore Energy Operations Group evaluated the potential consequences of a worst-case release of ammonia.  Based on this evaluation, Lake Shore Energy Operations Group determined that it was necessary to install a containment and water deluge system on the Boron facility anhydrous ammonia tank.  Lake Shore Energy Operations Group made this decision for three reasons:\r\n1. General industry practice is to install a water deluge system on anhydrous ammonia tanks at power plants.\r\n2. A containment vessel will contain the movement of spilled anhydrous ammonia while it evaporates, and will also collect a portion of the ammonia saturated deluge water, thereby reducing the surface area of the ammonia spill and limiting emissions of ammonia.\r\n3. The entire town of Boron, including the Fire Department station, is within the significant impact threshold radius for the worst-case spill.\r\n4. The Kern County Fire Department Hazardous Material (HazMat) response team is located in Bakersfield, approximately 90 miles away.  Consequently, there would likely be at least a 1.5 hour response time for arrival of the HazMat team if a release were to occur. \r\nThe deluge system mitigates a release of ammonia by absorbing the ammonia in copious amounts of water.  This will lower the vapor pressure of the ammonia, reduce the evolution of vapor to the atmosphere from the resultant aqueous solution, and spread the duration of the release to atmosphere over a much longer period of time.  This mitigation will effectively lower the concentration of ammonia at offsite receptors.\r\nLake Shore Mojave LLC completed co"

The deluge system is designed for a flow rate of 0.25 gallons per minute per square foot of area with a total flow rate requirement of 296.8 gallons per minute.  The containment structure has a capacity of approximately 12,000 gallons and provides containment for the ammonia-saturated deluge water captured by the containment system.  The containment structure limits the surface area of the ammonia solution to the dimensions of the structure, and thereby reduces the release rate of ammonia into the atmosphere (relative to an uncontained pool of ammonia-saturated deluge water), which in turn reduces the resulting ammonia concentration at potential offsite receptors."
