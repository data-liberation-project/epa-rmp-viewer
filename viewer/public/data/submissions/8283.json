If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  It is the policy of Coash Inc. that any personnel that will be handling, involved in storing, or transportation of NH3 will be trained in the safe handling of it.  Safety meetings are held on various topics including anhydrous.\n\nOur St. Edward facility is a branch office of our Albion NE Plant.  Anhydrous, chemicals and lawn products are distributed to farmers from the Coash office.  Anhydrous is received, stored and distributed for direct application by farmers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 55,000 pounds in our one 12,00 gallon storaged tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be unloading a semi weighing 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe worst case release scenarion would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 55,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is .99 miles based on Degadis Modeling.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose at the anhydrous load-out resulting in a 4,000 pound release.  The distance to the endpoint would be .73 miles based on Degadis Modeling.\n\nThere have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at our facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nOur facility has implemented"
