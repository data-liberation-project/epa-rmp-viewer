The City of Fayetteville Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) meet the established criteria that require Program compliance through on-site storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, in excess of threshold limits.  At the WWTP, chlorine is used for disinfecting treated effluent, followed by addition of sulfur dioxide for reducing the effluent chlorine residual.  Chlorine is also used to disinfect potable water at the WTP, which is located adjacent to the wastewater facility.  Both the WTPand WWTP qualify for Program Level 2 regulation.\n\n\n\nThe City of Fayetteville is committed to providing essential municipal water treatment services while avoiding accidents that place human and environmental health at risk.  These goals are met through a comprehensive Accident Prevention Program and a coordinated Emergency Response Plan.  Specific elements of the Accident Prevention Program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage, handling, and use include:\n\n\n\n-On-site provision of safety information as required by State law, ASTM standards, and ASME standards \n\n-Identification of hazards associated with the storage, handling, and use of listed chemicals\n\n-Periodic review of equipment operating procedures, supplemented with written guidelines\n\n-Implementation of on-the-job training and observational competency testing programs\n\n-Periodic review of equipment maintenance procedures, supplemented with written guidelines\n\n-Performance of program compliance audits \n\n-Performance of incident investigations\n\n\n\nT"
