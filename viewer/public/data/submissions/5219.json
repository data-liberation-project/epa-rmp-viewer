Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed, and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 140,000 pounds stored in one (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.    \n\n10-34-0 Liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a hi"

After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0).\n\nSituated above the holding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pushes air up the tower.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down through the packing (i.e., Pall Rings) back down to the holding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaporates and cools the solution.\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization flows to a storage tank.\n\nNPK (nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium) grade fertilizers are manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, water and other raw materials to achieve the proper ratios. During this process the ammonia is added to the water to create an aqueous ammonia solution. This is the source of nitrogen for the fertilizer. The other sources of phosphorus and potassium are added to this solution in the amounts desired to achieve the proper NPK ratio (ie., 5-10-10, 16-4-4, 7-22-5).\n\nSlow release fertilizers are manufactured by combining water, anhydrous ammonia, and other raw materials. This process is done at an elevated temperature to form a certain molecular structure"

Ammonia is used in this process as a source of nitrogen for the fertilizer.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 140,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.16 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the storage tank is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the storage tank.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 0.56 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.
