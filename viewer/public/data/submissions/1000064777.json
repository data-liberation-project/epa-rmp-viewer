Inc.(C&D) is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a diversified line of consumer and health care products.  The C&D above designated locations consist of warehouse storage and shipping areas for the full line of C&D consumer products.  Manufacturing operations and/or administrative offices are also present (or nearby).  The local manufacturing operations are not subject to RMP requirements as no RMP chemical thresholds are associated with the manufacturing processes. \n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe operations affected by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers.  Product is received in palletized cases via trailer truck at site loading docks.  The product is moved within the warehouse to a designated aerosol storage location via forklift trucks.  Aerosol product is removed from the warehouse via forklift truck and loaded onto trailers for shipment to customers.  Pallets may be broken down by hand and cases re-palletized to accommodate less than full pallet orders.\n\n\n\nManufacturing operations at the plant do not involve RMP regulated hazardous materials above threshold amounts.  Various hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the finished good aerosol products stored in the warehouse.  Hydrocarbon propellants are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potenti"

Additionally, US Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.  The aggregate volume of flammable mixture in the Level II and Level III aerosol can inventory will exceed the RMP threshold.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe C&D Distribution Centers have no history of accidental releases associated with the regulated hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nPrevention Programs\n\n\n\nIn accordance with USEPA regulation and results of the hazard assessment, the Church & Dwight Distribution Centers are classified as a Program Level 1 facility.  Program Level 1 facilities are considered by USEPA to present minimal risk to the community.\n\n\n\nC&D has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards.  C&D takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Assessment\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?

Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nIn addition to C&D's management programs, specially designed systems to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an automatic, early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouses.  Aerosol storage racks are segregated by chain link fence and are equipped with in rack sprinkler systems to further mitigate aerosol flammability accidents.  All C&D forklift operators are trained and certified.  The firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected and tested quarterly by an outside independent company. Safety a"

The plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  The plan is shared with the local Fire Department and county Emergency Services, as appropriate for the warehouse location.  In the event of an emergency affecting the local community, C&D will work closely with the local, county, and state agencies to ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nC&D strives for continuous improvement of its safety programs.  C&D trains our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  C&D encourages its employees to suggest improvements or changes that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of programs and equipment, including forklift trucks.  The system and programs are routinely audited, typically by an outside company, to evaluate effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.\n\n \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nAerosol Storage in Warehouse\n\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. \n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS) Analysis\n\n\n\nPrepared by: Mark Hughes, CHMM, Sr. Manager Environmental Operations, Church & Dwight Co Inc.\n\nDate: June 22, 2015\n\n1.

The propellant blend constitutes approximately 61% of the final aerosol antiperspirant/deodorant product by weight and 86.9% of the final aerosol dry shampoo by weight.  The dry shampoo also contains approximately 5% denatured alcohol by weight.  Additionally, each mixture has a flash point below 100 degree F, and is therefore also subject to OSHA's PSM program.\n\nFlammable mixtures are subject to the RMP if there is a regulated flammable substance in the mixture above 1%, and the entire mixture meets the NFPA-4 criteria.  If the mixture meets both these criteria, you must include the total weight of the mixture (not just the regulated substance) in the threshold determination.\n\nNFPA-4 definition is: \n\n\"Material that will rapidly or completely vaporize at atmospheric pressure and normal ambient temperature or that are readily dispersed in air, and that will burn readily.\"\n\nBased on this definition the referenced mixtures would meet the flammable mixture requirement.\n\nThe covered process includes receipt, storage, and distribution of aerosol cans, which contain flammable propellants.\n\n\n\n1.2.    Threshold Quantity\n\nThe following analysis was completed to determine whether the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity for RMP and PSM would be exceeded.\n\nThe contents of each container contain a flammable mixture with greater than 1% of a listed flammable material, and an NFPA rating of 4.  Therefore the entire weight of the mixture inside the can must be used in determining threshold quantity.\n\n1.2.1    Aer"

Program 3 is the most stringent set of requirements while Program 1 is the least stringent.\n\nIn order to qualify for an EPA Program Level 1, the following conditions must be met:\n\n?    No off-site receptor in WCS hazard zone\n\n?    No \"reportable\" accidental releases in the last 5 years\n\n?    Emergency Response procedures coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning committee/local agencies.\n\nFacilities are considered Program Level 3 facilities if they are subject to OSHA PSM or are a listed North American Industrial Classification System (NAICs) company, unless they satisfy Program 1 criteria.

WORST CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nThe WCS is defined as:\n\n\"...the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the defined endpoint\"\n\nBased on the USEPA guidance, Risk Management Program for Warehouses (40 CFR Part 68), EPA 550-B-00-009, March 2009:\n\n\"For a release from a vessel, you need only consider the largest amount in the vessel. For the specific case of a warehouse, the largest vessels are 350 gallon totes, 55-gallon drums, 10-gallon pails, 150-lb cylinders, and other containers that are small relative to typical vessels in a chemical plant. Therefore, the spillage of the contents of one of these containers constitutes the worst-case scenario, although you may well be able to think of scenarios in which a quantity greater than Q as defined above can be released. Other credible scenarios could involve simultaneous damage to more than one vessel. EPA recommends that you consider multiple-vessel release scenarios, if credible and appropriate, as alternative release scenarios.\"\n\nBased on this guidance, the WCS can be defined as the loss of containment on a single aerosol can.
