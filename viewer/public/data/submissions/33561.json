      "SummaryText": "The Park Ten Foods facility located in Houston, Texas is a pork processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process raw pork into food products for distribution to retailers.\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia,  safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at the facility. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State and Local codes.  The facility was completely remodeled in 1999 which included replacing the high pressure ammonia receiver with a new tank and the majority of the piping system.  The remodeling provides newer equipment and the benefits associated with new facilities. This food processing facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State and Local codes and regulations.\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and  comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity. \n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\n?  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n?  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damag"

The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n?  A process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted in late 1999 and a PHA re-validation is schedule for late 2004.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \n\n?  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n?  For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n?  Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n?  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the "

The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.   Representatives of the Houston Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to contain any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
