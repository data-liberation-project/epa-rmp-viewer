Facility Policy\n   The owners, management, and employees of the Garden City Co-op, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n   The primary activities at the facility are to receive, store and transfer anhydrous ammonia to be sold to farmers for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 80,500# in one 18,000 gallon storage tank and eight 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n3. The Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenario\n   A. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the 18,000 gallon supply tank at a rate of 15,000 lbs/min over a 5 minute period. This would be the total quantity of the tank, which represents the 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 2.70 miles and would effect some of the approximately 120 residence who live within the radius.\n   B. The alternate release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is 0.64 miles and would effect some of the approximately 10 residence who live within the radius.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n   We have implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage ans Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1919.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or signifi"

The Emergency Response Program\n   The facliity has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38, has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), and has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facilities. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implelentation at this time."
