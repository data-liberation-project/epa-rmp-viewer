Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll ammonia releases, regardless of size, are investigated following incident investigation procedures.  The objective is to identify recommendations that will prevent these releases from re-occurring. Safety improvements are made to equipment and procedures using this technique to continually improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration systems at the Othello facility.  These procedures in conjunction with Hazard Analysis findings, Audit findings, and continuous scrutiny of the systems following Mechanical Integrity procedures result in continuous upgrades to minimize the likelihood of ammonia releases."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMcCain Foods USA, Inc. is committed to being a responsible member of the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  McCain\u00c2\u00bfs Othello facility is a potato processing plant which produces frozen potato products, such as French Fries and tater tots, for the retail and service markets.  Ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is used in the refrigeration system at the facility.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\nA.  Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nMcCain Foods uses many precautionary measures to prevent or minimize the accidental release of ammonia from the refrigeration systems.  These precautions include built in safety systems that will generate alarms or automatically shut down the refrigeration system if design limitations are exceeded (eg. Pressures, temperatures, or vessel operating levels).  These safety systems in conjunction with PLC automated control ensure that the system operates within safe limits minimizing the likelihood of an ammonia release.  A comprehensive Preventative Maintenance program is used to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of all equipment in the refrigeration systems and mechanics and operators are trained to maintenance and operating procedures to minimize the chance of human error and to maintain a well informed and qualified group of refrigeration personnel.\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThere are two ammonia refrigeration systems at the Othello facility.  Ammonia is the only substance handled at the Othello facility covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations.\n\n\nC.  Worst-Case & Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario describes a leak that lasts for 10 minutes releasing 17,500 lbs of ammonia from a single vessel with a toxic endpoint of 2.6 miles.\nThe altern"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Othello facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program regulation. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n- Employee Participation\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Operating Procedures\n- Employee Training\n- Contractor Safety\n- Pre-startup Safety Review Procedures\n- Mechanical Integrity (Preventative Maintenance Program)\n- Hot Work Permit (Non-routine Work Authorizations)\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n- Compliance Audit Procedures\n- Trade Secret Statement\n\n\nE.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been only one accident in the last five years.  It occurred in August of 2006.  The root cause was vessel over-pressurization resulting in a relief valve opening and venting to atmosphere per design.  The release lasted for 12 minutes with a total estimated quantity of 400 lbs of ammonia being vented to atmosphere.  There were no injuries after 50 people were evacuated.  One person reported to hospital for a cautionary check with immediate release.  Engineering and procedural changes were made to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident.\n\n\nF.  Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the Othello facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia releases and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  This program has been coordinated with the Adams County Emergency Management and the"
