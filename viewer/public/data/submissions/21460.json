Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. - Lynchburg, Virginia (MarkWest) facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program in place at the Lynchburg facility encompasses such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Campbell County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses propane storage and wholesale distribution.  The one substance present at the facility regulated by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is propane, which is delivered to the facility by rail car and tank truck.  The propane is stored in one of nine 30,000-gallon capacity vessels.  The propane is then distributed to various customers by tank truck loading.\n\n \n\nTotal quantities of product stored in each of the 30,000-gallon capacity vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief vessels provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\n\n\n\nBased on the administrative controls described above, th"

Therefore, the maximum quantity of propane present at the facility is equal to nine vessels containing 27,000 gallons each: 241,000 gallons (the equivalent of 1,027,112 pounds) of propane. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables  and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from one of the nine 30,000-gallon capacity vessels in the propane storage process.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 27,000 gallons (114,124 lbs) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Offsite receptors would be affected.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from one of the ten 30,000-gallon capacity vessels in the propane storage process.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 49,000 lbs of propane due to a loading hose ruture.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion. Off-site receptors would not be affected.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Pre"

The propane storage and distribution process at MarkWest is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest Lynchburg facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The \"What If?\" methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup after turn around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that the employees operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is "

Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as required.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the  provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
