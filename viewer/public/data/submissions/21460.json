This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program in place at the Lynchburg facility encompasses such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Campbell County Local Emergency Planning Committee which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses propane storage and wholesale distribution.  The one substance present at the facility regulated by the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is propane, which is delivered to the facility by rail car and tank truck.  The propane is stored in one of nine 30,000-gallon capacity vessels.  The propane is then distributed to various customers by tank truck loading.\r\n \r\nTotal quantities of product stored in each of the 30,000-gallon capacity vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 90% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief vessels provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\r\n\r\nBased on the administrative controls described above, th"

Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as required.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nMarkWest conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the  provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every three years as required by the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.58) and any corrections required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMarkWest investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to preve"

All reports are retained for a period of five years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nMarkWest believes that successful RMP, PSM, and accident prevention programs require a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, MarkWest employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP program, in particular, information relating to and resulting from process hazard analyses. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nPeriodically, MarkWest hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor is undertaken.  MarkWest has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards relating to the contractor's work and the associated processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nMarkWest has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.

Therefore, the maximum quantity of propane present at the facility is equal to nine vessels containing 27,000 gallons each: 241,000 gallons (the equivalent of 1,027,112 pounds) of propane. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables  and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from one of the nine 30,000-gallon capacity vessels in the propane storage process.  The scenario involves the release of the entire quantity of the vessel, approximately 27,000 gallons (114,124 lbs) of propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Offsite receptors would be affected.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from one of the ten 30,000-gallon capacity vessels in the propane storage process.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 49,000 lbs of propane due to a loading hose ruture.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in the vapor cloud explosion.
