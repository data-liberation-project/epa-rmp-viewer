Our facility is completely under cover below ground surface.  We utilize Ammonia (Anhydrous) as a refridgerant for our facility.  Our primary business is providing cold storage warehousing opertaions for the food industry.  The total amount of Ammonia that we have on-site is 35,000 pounds at any given time.\n\nOur system is that which enables us to keep all the ammonia self contained within the closed loop system that we have.  All the ammonia is stored in the area known as the Engineer Room and has a ventilation that would ventilate the area if a release directly outside above the faciltiy.  This room is self contained and with the most updated emergency shut-off system available at the time of installation to assure complete isolation of ammonia in case of a release should ever occur.\n\nKansas City Cold Storage & Ice Company, has personnel trained and on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week to mitigate or implement a emergency response team to report to our facility.  Our plant engineer and plant operators are trained to the First Responders Operational Awareness Level as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.120 (e)(q).\n\nShould there be a case where there has been a release of ammonia, the plant engineer would isolate the release and notify our outside emergency response team to report to our facility.  Our contracted emergency response team is Environmental Technology and Services of Kansas City, Missouri.  They would be responding to our facility to mitigate the release.\n\nThe worst case scenario that could occur within the facility would be that of a result from a natural disaster or major fire to the facility, thus causing the release of all 35,000 pounds of ammonia into the environment.  In this case Kansas City Cold Storage & Ice C"

In this case our plant engineer and operators would isolate the release and make the repair to the equipment.  Plant Engineer would then notify supervisor of the release and make proper notification necessary for the size of release.\n\nKansas City Cold Storage & Ice Company, is always seeking new information and training for personnel to reduce the risk to employees and other personnel in the immediate area long with protecting the environment.  We take great pride in our safety record with not having a reportable release within the past five (5) years.  We take great measures to keeping up with the new standards pertaining to the refrigeration industry in order to improve our safety for our facility and community."
