Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the City of\nNorwood Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is primarily used for production of fluid milk and ice cream products. The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration systems is approximately 38,000 pounds. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 8.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If Scenarios. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are reevaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, United Dairy Farmers, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place so that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. carries out well documented maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to provide proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems"

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at United Dairy Farmers, Inc. to manage changes in ammonia systems technology, equipment, and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, is opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an unintentional release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. truly believes that Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention is a team effort.
