Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the City of\nNorwood Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is primarily used for production of fluid milk and ice cream products. The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration systems is approximately 38,000 pounds. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 8.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/"
