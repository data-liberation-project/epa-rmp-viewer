Propane is inherent to both the polyethylene and polypropylene processes.  \n\n4.0      Offsite Consequence Analysis\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on the Solvay Polymers, Inc.  facility.  The subject analysis consisted of  Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario analyses. \nTwo Worst Case Scenarios were completed for flammable RMP compounds since each  Worst Case Scenario shows RMP impacts to different offsite receptors.  The first is a release of 330,000 pounds of isobutane from an isobutane storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The second is a release of 8,400 pounds of ethylene from the ethylene header, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Based on the RMP analysis, the  pressure effects  formed by the Worst Case Scenarios for these flammable compounds would reach offsite industrial endpoints but would not reach residential populations at the RMP endpoint.\nOne Worst Case Scenario was completed for toxic RMP compounds.  This scenario is an instantaneous release of 3,000 pounds of titanium tetrachloride liquid from a storage vessel, resulting in a toxic gas cloud.   Based on the RMP analysis, the resulting toxic cloud would reach offsite industrial endpoints but would not reach residential populations at the RMP endpoint concentration.\nWorst case weather conditions are considered (stable, low wind speed) for all Worst Case Scenarios.  In addition, the Worst Case Scenarios did not consider any existing safety systems or mitigation actiivities.    No environmental receptors are within the RPM Worst Case Scenario impact areas.\nTwo Alternative Release Scenarios were completed for flammable RMP compounds since each Alternative Release Scenario shows RMP impacts to different offsite receptors.
