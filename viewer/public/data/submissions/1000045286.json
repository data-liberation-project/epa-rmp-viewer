      "SummaryText": "The Mott's Wastewater Treatment Plant installed an anhydrous ammonia tank in October 1998.  Since then, the tank  has been refurbished and received a certifcate of operation as required every three years from the PA Dept. of Labor and Industry (L & I), with the most recent certifcate received as of 11/8/2006.  New pressure valves were added to the system in 2004 and again in 2007.  The tank feeds ammonia vapor directly into the wastewater treatment lagoon as a nutrient for the micro-organisms.  The tank capacity is 2,300 liquid gallons; however, the tank in never filled to more than the 85% level.  Therefore, the maximum actual amount stored in the tank is 1,995 gallons, which equates to 9,970 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Even though the actual amount stored is less than the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds, Mott's has and will continue to prepare a Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe ammonia system consists of a tank, regulator, check valve, and piping.  The tank also has two pressure release valves and overfill protection.  \n\nMott's has an emergency response plan which is coordinated with the local Adams County, PA. LEPC, and an emergency evacuation plan.  There have been no releases to date.  All wastewater treatment operators have had ammonia handling training.  The facility demonstrates compliance with OSHA and ANSI standards, and maintains an Environmental Management System.  "
