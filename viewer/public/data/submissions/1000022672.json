California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\nA?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR A?68\nA?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR A?5189\nA?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR A?1910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Warmerdam Packing LLC has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1    WARMERDAM PACKING LLC, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Warmerdam Packing LLC has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name             Process Chemical    Process Quantity(lbs)\nAmmonia    Refrigeration   Ammonia                    34,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nWarmerdam Packing LLC has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1.    Prep"

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Warmerdam Packing LLC business practices\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter&copy; software to ensure that all necessary Warmerdam Packing LLC employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nWarmerdam Packing is a commercial packinghouse for fruit - apples, cherries, peaches, nectarines and some grapes.  The facility has one (1) ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity in support of production activities.\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each cold room where it passes through a liquid feed solenoid, expansion valve, and then into an accumulator vessel.  The liquid drops in pressure and temperature as it passes through the expansion valve into accumulator vessels serving cooling coils.  Ceiling mounted evaporator coils are located in seven controlled atmosphere and one bin rooms, as well as two refrigerated hallways and a loading dock.  Accumular vessels for these coils are located on the rooftop, or are mounted on corridor walls outside of the rooms themselves.  Forced air evaporator coils are located in one precool and two cold storage rooms, as well as two precool zones.  The coils and their accumulator vessels are behind bunker walls.  There are three new and one old hydrocoolers with dual flooded coils and surge tanks.  Produce from the field is cooled by water which itself has been cooled by passing over the hydrocooler coils.  Low pressure vapor and liquid are returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to main accumulators located in the engine rooms.  The vapor is piped to one or more of six reciprocating and one screw compressors which elevate "

The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe ammonia system at the facility consists of vessels which are interconnected.  Therefore, it was treated as a single process.\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nWarmerdam Packing LLC has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Warmerdam Packing LLC facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also as"

California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR A?3220\nA?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR A?1910.38 \nA?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 A?5192(q)\nA?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR A?1910.120(q)\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Warmerdam Packing LLC continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Warmerdam Packing LLC's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Warmerdam Packing LLC's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nWarmerdam Packing LLC has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard a"

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, Warmerdam Packing LLC has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\nFor the future, Warmerdam Packing LLC now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Warmerdam Packing LLC employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Warmerdam Packing LLC will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n"
