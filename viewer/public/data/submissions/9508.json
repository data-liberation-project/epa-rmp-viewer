OUR FACILITY WILL BE APPLYING CHLORINE IN THE TREATMENT PROCESS TO DISINFECT THE WATER.  THE FEEDING APPARATUS IS NEW AND STATE OF THE ART WITH DETECTORS AND ALARMS TO MINIMIZE ANY RELEASE THAT MAY OCCUR.  THE STAFF AT PVUD HAS BEEN TRAINED BY OUR SUPPLIER FOR SAFE HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE GAS.  THE CHEATHAM COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE DIRECTOR HAS BEEN GIVEN AN ONSITE TOUR OF OUR FACILITY AND UNDERSTANDS OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN.  CONTINUAL TRAINGING WILL BE REQUIRED OF ALL PLANT OPERATORS TO INSURE SAFETY PROCEDURES ARE CURRENT AND EFFICIENT.\nTHE MANAGEMENT HAS DESIGNED THE FACILITY WITH SEVERAL SAFETY FEATURES TO MINIMIZE LOSS IF A RELEASE DOES OCCUR.  THE FACILITY HAS CHLORINE MONITORS AND ALARMS IN THE CHLORINE STROAGE ROOM AND THE FEEDING ROOM, WITH NEW EMERGENCY BREATHING DEVICES.  ALSO, TWO EMERGENCY SHOWERS WITH EYE WASHES ARE INSTALLED.  WE HOPE THE REDUCE, IF NOT ELIMINATE ANY LOSS IF A RELEASE OCCURS.\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO MODELING WAS PERFORMED USING THE EPA ASSUMPTIONS AND CONCLUDED WITH AN ENDPOINT OF 1.3 MILES  WITH  APPROXIMATELY  500 PEOPLE."
