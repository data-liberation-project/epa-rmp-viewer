The chlorine supplier complies with Cylinder and Ton Container Procedures for Chlorine Packaging, Edition 2, Revision 1, June 1994.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Regular inspections of chlorine storage and piping systems ensure system integrity and provides for preventative maintenance and repairs. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the Oroville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThis facility is a 22 MW electric power generation unit.  Chlorine gas is used to prevent biofouling in the cooling tower and fire suppression pond and pumping system.  The chlorine storage system at each process, consists of two, one-ton cylinders, with only one cylinder in service at any time.  The system is designed to prevent rapid loss of chlorine gas.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of one-ton cylinder when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in release of 2000 lbs. of chlorine gas.  Sudden failure of the tank was assumed to release the contents, resulting in a cold vapor cloud that moves offsite under at 1.5 meters per second under stable atmospheric conditions that minimize mixing. The results of this analysis indicate that a worst case chlorine release results in a toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) that extends 1.3 miles.  Although the two chlorine processes are isolated with respect to each other, they are sufficiently proximate so that the affected area resulting from a worst case release from either process is the same.  Therefore the worst case scenario is identical for both process locat"

      "SummaryText": "t-if\" analysis was selected and utilized along with a checklist.  The process hazard analysis was developed based on water treatment industry guidelines and process specific criteria.  Certain initiating events were determined to pose a minimal risk.  The facility is located outside of the 100 year flood plain (Zone X) and in an area if low-risk for seismic activity (Zone 3).  Severe weather events are unusual, but a maximum wind speed of 80 MPH could occur in a severe thunderstorm or F-1 tornado.  There are no flammables, explosives or incompatible organic chemicals in proximity to either chlorine process area that could cause, or contribute to, tank failure.  Chlorine storage and use occurs at a location, remote from any roadways or railways, and is therefore not exposed to off-site traffic.  \n\nCatastrophic failure of a tank was not identified as a likely scenario.  The process hazard analysis identified scenarios that could cause equipment damage, or result in equipment failure with the worst case release being from a broken valve or failed fusible plug.  Potentially catastrophic failures are adequately addressed by unit design and safety engineering integral to the cylinder and regulator unit.  \nThe PHA identified the need to modify several standard operating procedures, and identified labeling, flexible chlorinator line support and protection, and vehicle exclusion barriers as deficiencies to be addressed.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nWritten operating procedures are in effect for general chlorine safety operations, container loading and unloading, normal startup, normal shutdown and emergency procedures.  Supporting procedures apply for specific equipment operations such as crane safety procedures at SMP5.  Chlorine cylinders are delivered by All Pure Chemical Company which operates in accordance with written Standard Operating Procedures.  Procedures at the facility include off-loading delivery vehicle, mounting cylinders in operating position, removal and placemen"

The chlorination process is relatively simple and process changes are not expected to occur unless alternative anti-biofouling chemicals are implemented or chlorine operations are consolidated at a new location.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nAll visitors and contractors on site must register with the office.  Contractors are informed of specific hazards in the areas they are assigned work, and are be accompanied by plant personnel for orientation.  All contractors are required to produce proof of an adequate safety plan, and are required to conform to safety and environmental standards at the plant.  Contractors that perform work at the facilities are required to participate in an orientation training session the first time that they are on site.  The training includes site rules, basic safety requirements, handling of emergencies, fire protection information and hazardous materials present at the site.  \n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\nA welding and cutting safety procedure is in effect.  POPI has developed and implemented a written procedure for the issuance of \"hot work\" permits.  No welding or hot work is required or authorized in the vicinity of the chlorine tanks.  There are no welded fittings or pipelines.  Repair of moveable shelters can be performed at a location remote from the tanks and pipelines.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents related to the regulated equipment in the past five years, nor for the history of the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPOPI has developed and distributed a business plan for emergency response pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 25503.5 and subdivision (b) of Section 25505 of the Health and Safety Code.  A copy of the Business Plan is available in the Control Room and main office.\nEmergency response is based on recog"

The policy for emergency response at Pacific Oroville Power is to immediately notify the hazardous materials response team (Kelly Ridge Volunteer Fire Dept.) of any emergency.  The Kelly Ridge team is equipped to handle chlorine emergencies and maintains an inventory of repair parts including fusible plugs.\n\nPOPI personnel are equipped only with escape breathing apparatus and will not respond to a significant leak or rescue situation.  Small fires will be contained and mitigated with water sprays and fire extinguishing equipment onsite.  Emergency notification is required for any release or threatened release of a hazardous material which poses a significant present or potential health, safety or environmental hazard.  The plant manager is designated incident command when present.  The senior operator is designated incident command when management is not present.  Incident command is transferred to emergency responders upon arrival.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA process hazard analysis was conducted on June 4, 1999 using a what-if and checklist analysis.  Several deficiencies were identified that require modification.  POPI is currently revising several standard operating procedures.  Upon completion, these more detailed procedures will be implemented through training and review.  The chlorine process areas were audited.  Improved signs, vehicle exclusion barriers and general clean-up were identified as priorities.  Improved lighting is to be installed for night operations.  POPI is also in the process of evaluating leak detection and alarm equipment.  Improved documentation of equipment being specifically approved for use in chlorine service is being obtained."
