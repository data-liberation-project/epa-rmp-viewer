The facility designation as the Tayman Drive WTP is used herein.  The Tayman Drive WTP is located at 440 Tayman Drive in Midlothian, Ellis County, Texas.  The Tayman Drive WTP produces potable water for the City of Midlothian.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Tayman Drive WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Tayman Drive WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Water Plant Manager is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include a commitment to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are profic"

Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Tayman Drive WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe Tayman Drive WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code.  The WTP is located inside the Midlothian city limits, and the Tayman Drive WTP is included in the Ellis County Emergency Response Plan.  Coordination activities are conducted through the City's Emergency Manager in accordance with ?68.93 with the first responders [the City of Midlothian Fire Department] and Ellis County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) at least annually, and more frequently if necessary.  The Tayman Drive WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Tayman Drive WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Tayman Drive WTP.  The City of Midlothian's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrou"
