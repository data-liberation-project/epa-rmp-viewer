Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nPappas & Co. carries a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of discovery, defensive emergency actions including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our safety equipment that might be needed is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nCounty of Fresno is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.

We remove field heat from locally grown seasonal vegetables and short term storage in our Cold Storage Facility. There are no major changes to the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nReport organization includes; Certification statement, Summary, Detailed Elements and Map of  Potential Impact.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Pappas & Co. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Packing and storage of fresh produce..  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration in a closed loop system.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, MARPLOT, Landview6  and RMPCOMP software.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  In this scenario all of the Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes"

      "SummaryText": "place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. There is no mitigation by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Due to the rural location minimal off-site impacts would occur. This is obviously a theoretical exercise and extremely unlikely or even possible.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Ammonia Refrigeration compressor shaft seal failure.  The leak is stopped after 60 minutes by manual isolation of the equipment.  Isolation has no impact on toxic endpoint and quantity is reduced slightly. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is < 0.1 miles. Population impacts are 0. This is a much more typical release from this system.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with California Mechanical Code 2001.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nPappas & Co. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular inter"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  Our SOP's also include sections on Quality Control, Ammonia Unloading, Lock-out/Tag-out, line opening, Oil Draining, Adding Oil, replacing SRV's, Emergency Pressure Control, and Confined Spaces. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nPappas & Co. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed. We regularly attend the Cold Storage Technologies annual safety day.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nPappas & Co. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
