This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nBama Foods, LTD. maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Bama Foods, LTD. facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 9\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 180-200 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 42,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThe facility also follows re"

      "SummaryText": "cognized standards and good engineering practices using state and local codes and IIAR standards.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors throughout the facility which will alert plant personnel in the event of an ammonia detection.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that Bama Foods, LTD. has not had any RMP reportable accidents in the last five years (March 2009 - March 2014).  Such \"accidents\" would involve serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  However, the facility had a minor incident which occurred on May 25, 2013.  The incident investigation showed that the evaporator coil of AU-23 had corroded, resulting in a pinhole leak.  Mitigation measures that resulted from the investigation consisted of the replacement of the evaporator coil.  The facility also continues to conduct corrosion monitoring as part of the Mechanical Integrity program.  The evaporator was returned to operation on July 26, 2013.  \n\n        \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBama Foods, LTD. has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained throughout the year.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.  \n\n\n\nPLAN"
