(PRI)  recognizes that the protection of the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the general public, as well as the protection of the environment, are among its highest corporate policies.  In support of the principles of its Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy as it relates to accidental release prevention and emergency response, PRI will identify the potential for accidents and emergency situations and develop, maintain and test emergency response plans which provide for the protection of the health and safety of its employess, the public, and the environment adjacent to its operations.  To ensure \"due diligence\" in the management of EHS issues and compliance with the corporate EHS Policy, PRI has implemented an EHS Management System. To this end, all levels of management are held accountable for EHS protection within their areas of responsibility, while each employee is accountable for the performance of their job in compliance with the EHS Policy.\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances - The Smith Ranch Project produces uranium (yellowcake) using in-situ leach technologies.  The Project has one regulated substance/process; an anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution system.  Anhydrous ammonia is added to the precipitation circuit at the Central Processing Plant for pH control during yellowcake processing.  The system operates on demand and consists of an appoximate 18,000 gallon (water capacity) storage vessel,  vaporizer, piping, and other appurtenances.        \n\n(c) Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios - Administrative controls limit the maximum capacity of the anhydrous ammonia storage vessel to approximately 91,000 lbs.  The worst-case scenario consists of an unmitigated release of the entire contents of the vessel, at maximum capacity, over a ten-minute period.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp computer program, the distance to toxi"

The worst-case release impact distance includes two residences and public lands to which access is not restricted for hunting, etc.  No environmental receptors were identified within the worst-case release impact zone.\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of the failure of a 1/2-inch nipple connected to a pressure gauge on the liquid end of the vaporizer circuit.  Shearing off the nipple would create a hole approximately 0.31 square inches in diameter.  Using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the release rate was estimated to be 741 lbs/minute over a period of 10 minutes.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp computer program, the distance to toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.5 miles.  No public or environmental receptors were identified within the alternative release impact zone.\n\n(d) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - PRI's general accidental release prevention program is based on the design and use of equipment in accordance with industry codes and standards and good engineering practices, proper training of operators and maintenance personnel in the effective use of operating procedures, and completion of hazard reviews.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), including full-face cartridge respirators and/or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), that is worn by operators and maintenance personnel whenever an ammonia line is opened, and employee awareness of the hazardous properties of ammonia.\n\n(e) Five-Year Accident History - No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at the Smith Ranch Project within the last five years.\n\n(f) Emergency Response Program - Based on the relatively remote location of the Smith Ranch Project and the amount of time needed by local responders to address an emergency situation, PRI has  implemented an Emergency Response Plan fo"

The Plan consists of evacuation and response procedures, procedures for notification of local responders and the public, and documentation of emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures to ammonia.  The Plan has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee of Converse County, Wyoming, and incorporated into the Community Emergency Response Plan.\n\n(g) Planned Changes to Improve Safety - PRI plans to conduct an updated Hazard Review of the anhydrous ammonia system during 2003.  Any changes to the ammonia system or chemical safety program will be addressed following completion of the Hazard Review."
