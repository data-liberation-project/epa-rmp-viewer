If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Gardena City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThis facility manufacturers a wide range of composite structures and high temperature materials for the defense and commercial markets.  Propane is used as a process gas in the manufacturing of high temperature brakes and as a fuel for forklifts.  The propane is stored in four 1,150-gallon storage tanks.  Pipes and valves are used to convey the propane from the storage tanks into manufacturing process, while propane for fuel is dispensed directly at the tanks.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario. \n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 1,150-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60 ?F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles. There are no private homes within the distance to the endpoint.  A total population of 46 people from other sources (businesses) is within the endpoint.  The Alternative Summary Scenario, with an endpoint of 0.03 miles, would only affect 4 people.\n\nThe residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected under each scenario.  The population residing in the resulting circle was estimated from the most recent U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census data using the Block Group Uniform Density Method as contained in the LandView III Environmental Mapping Software obtained from the Bureau of the Census.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preve"
