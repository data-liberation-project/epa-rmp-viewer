              "Description": "MMPP Martin  Expansion Project stores anhydrous ammonia onsite for control of nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions from the plant?s four combustion turbines.  Ammonia is delivered to the site by tanker truck and is stored in one, above ground, carbon steel pressure vessel.  Pressure is maintained through the use of two electrical vaporizers to maintain a minimum pressure of 80 psig.  Maximum pressure is 300 psig.  Ammonia vapor is conveyed via pressure to each unit?s selective catalytic reduction process, where it is diluted with air and then injected into the flue gas stream upstream of a catalyst.\n\nMMPP Martin Expansion Project is a new facility and as such, the Prevention Program elements discussed here were utilized to help define how this facility was designed and how it will be operated and maintained.\n\nThe prevention program at MMPP consists of \n1) Engineering controls \n2) Establishment of safe standard operating procedures and training.  \n3) Process Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n4) Establishment of management of change process\n\nEngineering controls include the following:\nEstablishment of maximum fill level.\nProviding relief valves\nProviding interlocks to prevent filling the tank if pressure or level is high.\nProviding remote emergency stop pushbutton to shut down process.\nProviding unloading area sensors for ammonia release detection.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures address\nAnhydrous Ammonia Handling\nUnloading\nNormal Startup, Operation, Shutdown\nEmergency Shutdown and Operation\nStartup Following a Turnaround or Emergency Shutdown\nTaking Equipment Out of Service\nTemporary Operations\n\nTraining is tailored to categories of personnel involvement and exposure to the anhydrous ammonia.  All employees receive general information regarding anhydrous ammonia hazards, the MSDS, emergency procedures, and the location of relevant documents which are available for all employees to review.  Personnel directly involved with site safety, ammonia unloading, and facility operations and maintenance receive more detailed information regarding specific operating procedures and check sheets.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment was performed with a group of twenty-five people from MMPP, the adjacent FPL Manatee Station, LaRoche (the ammonia supplier), and Tropicana (a near-by large user of anhydrous ammonia with extensive experience).  Follow-up sessions were held as items were evaluated and decisions were made regarding actions to be taken as a result of the identified potential hazards.\n\nWhile MMPP operation of the Martin Expansion Project is expected to be only for three months, a Management of Change process was established to document changes is the process.",

      "SummaryText": "SYSTEM DESCRIPTION.  The MMPP Manatee Expansion Project provides five additional electrical generating units on the property of the FPL Manatee Power Plant.  These five units include four combustion turbine-generators, and one steam turbine-generator.  Nox emissions of the combustion turbines are reduced through the use of selective catalytic reduction.  That process consumes ammonia.  At this site, the ammonia is provided in anhydrous form.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 20,000 gallon steel storage tank, surrounded by a concrete retaining wall.  Ammonia is delivered by tanker truck in liquid form.  The maximum level to which it is filled is 86%.  In the tank, the ammonia is stored as liquid under pressure.  Two 100% capacity vaporizers are provided to ensure pressure is maintained at lower temperatures.  Pressure will vary from 80 to 300 psig.\n\nAmmonia vapor is transported via pressure to each heat recovery steam generator's ammonia injection skid, where the ammonia is diluted with air prior to injection into the flue gas upstream of the catalyst.\n\nOPERATOR ORGANIZATION.  Martin-Manatee Power Partners is a limited liability corporation formed by parent companies Zachry Construction Corporation and Black & Veatch for the purpose of engineering, procuring, and constructing the expansion of the Manatee power plant.  As a part of its contractual obligations to owner FPL, MMPP must operate the facility for three months.  It is under this obligation and temporary operating scenario that this RMP is being filed.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM.  \n\nMMPP and it?s parent companies have a long-established very high expectation regarding safety and environmental protection.  The following documents were established at the outset for the Manatee Expansion Project:\n\nSafety Recovery Plan\nHazardous Energy Control Procedure\nSite Emergency Response Plan\nSite Specific Safety and Training Manual\nSite Environmental Control Plan\n\nThe following  letter from Zachry Construction Corporation P"

It is provided here to illustrate the Company?s dedication and commitment to safety:\n\nCORPORATE SAFETY PHILOSOPHY\n\nLETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n\nTo all employees,\n\nThe philosophy by which we operate our Company has several components that are just as relevant and important today as they were when the company was founded.  Most important among these is a concern for the well being of all our employees and a desire to create a work environment that values the safety and health of our workforce above all else.  By all established and recognized metrics, we have been quite successful over the years in meeting our safety goals.  We have not, however, been as successful as we would like to be and, clearly, not as successful as we can be.  Not until we identify any potential hazards that might exist at our worksite, and manage our work such that our employees are not at risk, can we be truly satisfied.  We must accept nothing less from ourselves.\n\nTo achieve this ultimate goal requires not only active participation in our safety processes by all employees; it requires constant commitment and leadership from everyone.  It is critical that all employees feel a strong sense of responsibility, empowerment, and accountability when it comes to ensuring that everyone works safely.  Only by working together, with every employee doing their part, can we make safety incidents a thing of the past.  Without question, safety is everyone?s responsibility.\n\nWorking safely is not always easy or expedient, but it is always smart and, more importantly, it is always the right thing to do.  It is also an integral part of the way Zachry Company will conduct its business.  Additionally, there is an expectation that all employees will conduct themselves in a way that consistently demonstrates proper and safe behavior.  I am confident that, together, we can continue to improve our performance and meet every goal we set for oursel"

Zachry\n\n===============================================================\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is covered at this site under the OSHA PSM rule.  Specific to this RMP, the prevention program at MMPP consists of (1) Engineering Controls, (2) Establishment of safe Standard Operating Procedures and Training, (3) Process Hazard Assessment (PHA), and Establishment of Management of Change Process.  These are described in more detail in the Prevention Program Description.\n\nThe overall approach to minimizing risk of accidental release is based on a foundation of sound engineering design,  careful construction with high attention to QA/QC practices, development of appropriate standard operating procedures, and training for affected employees.  Design has included features such as engineered controls to prevent overfilling of the tank, breakaway valve stations to minimize release should a truck pull away before uncoupling, monitoring stations for detection of accidental releases, and water sprays to help minimize migration of vapor releases.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  This is a new facility with no prior history with anhydrous ammonia.  There have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the time of this filing.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.  The employees of MMPP and neighboring FPL Manatee Station are not trained as first responders.  In the event of a large-scale release, site personnel will follow an established emergency response plan which includes notification of MMPP management, FPL management, 911, local emergency responders, and previously identified firms with the capability and willingness to respond to anhydrous ammonia releases.\n\nLocal emergency personnel have been involved in training provided by MMPP regarding the anhydrous ammonia facility and its potential risks.\n\nAll site personnel have received training.

Personnel who may have to enter a high concentration area inn order to isolate a system with a manual valve, for example,  have received 24-hour training.  They must remain clean-shaven at the point of SCBA mask contact, and have been instructed in the use of the appropriate protective PPE and SCBA.\n\nMMPP considers the delivery of ammonia at the site to be one of the highest risk periods..  Unloading will be done by the ammonia vendor by their qualified personnel.  As an additional safety measure, MMPP will station a trained person, with protective suit and SCBA to observe the unloading and intervene if necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  A PHA process was undertaken as a part of the RMP.  Identified issues were considered and addressed.  As this RMP is being filed prior to initial arrival of anhydrous ammonia on site, there are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
