In the plant VA offloading procedure there are several specific instructions which include the required maximum tank level in which more material can be added to the tank, a step that instructs one to ground all vessels being transferred to and from, continuous monitoring of the VA vessels during transfer, and safe detachments from the VA vessels take place with the help of dripless fittings.  The emergency response policies are all located in Plant Emergency Response Plan.  All emergency response instructions are written to insure that mitigation efforts are carried out in the safest and most environmental friendly steps.
