In the plant VA offloading procedure there are several specific instructions which include the required maximum tank level in which more material can be added to the tank, a step that instructs one to ground all vessels being transferred to and from, continuous monitoring of the VA vessels during transfer, and safe detachments from the VA vessels take place with the help of dripless fittings.  The emergency response policies are all located in Plant Emergency Response Plan.  All emergency response instructions are written to insure that mitigation efforts are carried out in the safest and most environmental friendly steps.  The following is an example of our vapor release procedure:\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTION PLAN FOR VAPOR RELEASE\n\n\nIF YOU DISCOVER A VAPOR RELEASE: \n\n7 Notify Group Leader.\n7 Immediately check %LEL with combination O2/combustible gas meter.\n7 Group Leader will notify Rohm & Haas Texas Safety Dispatch for informational\n purposes only or to respond.\n7 If Safety Dispatch is requested to respond, Group Leader or designee will sound the \n Emergency Evacuation Alarm.\n7 Group Leader or designee will notify Rohm & Haas Texas Safety Dispatch with the \n following information:"
