Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Farmers Coop Association (Ainsworth) are\n     committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.\n     If an addidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\n     department, or other authorties, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the\n     people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\n     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct \n     application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000-gallon storage tank.  Anhydrous \n     Ammonia is also stored in 61-1000 gal wagons for another 311,100 pounds.  The\n     maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 441,150-pounds.  Propane\n     is stored in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of propane\n     stored would be 188,700-pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenerio\n\n     a.     The worst-case scenerio for each chemical would be the release of the total\n             contents of the largest storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\n             Anhydrous Ammonia - The maximum quantity released would be 130,050\n             pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\n             capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of\n             dispersion of the gas to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles.\n\n             Propane - The maximum quantity released would be 94,400 pounds, which\n             represents the volume of the largest storage"
