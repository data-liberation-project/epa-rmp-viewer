      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nFacility Description\r\nThe AmeriGas Oroville terminal is propane storage and distribution facility.  The process involves unloading rail cars into the propane bulk storage tanks using compressors and loading transports and bobtails using Liquid Pumps.\r\nThe facility includes five (5) above-ground storage tanks with capacity of 30,000 gallons each. It has two (2) Compressors used to unload the rails cars.  The terminal has a siding with five (5) rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload propane to storage tanks using a system of Compressors. Compressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tank and compress them or increase their pressure and discharge into the rail cars to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the pressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid propane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks.\r\nThere are two (2) bulkheads. The terminal has one (1) Liquid Pump. \r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\r\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Supervisor who are able to immediately assist to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas cu"

      "SummaryText": "stomers.\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\nWorst Case Scenario \r\nThe worst case scenario that was considered was catastrophic release of propane from a 30, 000 Gallons Tank. Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n The facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. \r\nNotification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. If an actual incident occurs, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required. \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes."
