Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and trained on any applicable change in operating discipline associated with the modification.\n\nRMP compliance will be confirmed through an annual RMP audit performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.58. A report of the findings will be generated following the audit, and all deficiencies and/or recommendations will be promptly addressed and the resolution documented.\n\nProcedures on incident investigation, reporting, and documentation are being developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.60. The investigation will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Incident investigation reports will be maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\n\nProtec Pac USA believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\nD. Five-year accident history\n\nThe Protec Pac USA Sidney facility is a new installation, therefore, the five-year accident history section is not applicable.\n\n\nE. Emergency response program\n\nProtec Pac USA has developed an integrated emergency response program that complies with the RMP and PSM requirements. The emergency response plan includes:  \n\n* Procedures for informing the Shelby County LEPC and the community about any accidental releases;\n* Documentation of first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental exposure; and\n* Procedures for emergency response after an accidental release of isobutane.\n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Protec Pac USA\n\nProtec Pac USA is a new packaging products facility scheduled to be operational by November 2005.\n\nProtec Pac USA is strongly committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from workplace and accidental release hazards. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our emergency response policy requires immediate notification of the proper authorities and evacuation of the affected area. Safety, environmental protection and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with the Shelby County Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, and other community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n\nB. Description of stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Protec Pac USA facility, located in Sidney, Ohio, manufactures packaging materials. The plant operations include a polyolefin foam production line that employs isobutane as a manufacturing aid.\n\nPolyolefin foam is a plastic product made of polyolefin resin that can be produced in various thicknesses and colors and rolled to different lengths. This process involves mixing resin with talc, aging modifier, and other additives; extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized plastic extruder; adding a blowing agent (isobutane); then cooling the material and forcing it through a die. The storage quantity of isobutane exceeds the RMP threshold of 10,000 pounds. Isobutane is a flammable gas that is stored at the facility in a 18,000-gallon pressurized tank at 250 psi. The isobutane storage and piping system also includes a low pressure pump station, unloading"

      "SummaryText": "station, high pressure pump system, and gas detection devices.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses for isobutane were conducted for the Protec Pac USA facility. The USEPA RMPComp program was used to analyze the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was based on an isbutane release equal to the full capacity of the storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. This release results in an area of concern which extends 0.4 miles from the storage tank location. The alternative release scenario was based on a leak from isobutane piping with a release duration of 5 minutes. The estimated end point distance associated with the vapor cloud explosion resulting from the alternative case scenario is 0.2 miles from the storage tank location. The release scenario details are found in the RMP Report.\n\n\nC. General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nIsobutane is a regulated substance under both the EPA RMP and OSHA process safety management (PSM) rules. Therefore Protec Pac USA has developed a comprehensive program to meet the requirements under the RMP and PSM standards. Key components of the accident prevention and safety program include: Safety information; Hazards review; Operating procedures; Training; Equipment maintenance program; Management of change; RMP compliance audits; Accident/incident investigation; Routine physical safety audits.\n\nOur facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58 (Standard for Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases) and ASME standards for pressure piping. The air handling system is capable of maintaining the isobutane concentrations below 10% LEL in the Environmental Chamber, 2% LEL in the Inventory Room, and 1.5% LEL in the Customer Warehouse.\n\nPer the RMP Program Level 3 requirements, a process hazard analysis program has been developed. This analysis is performed to identify, evaluate, and contro"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nThe employee training covers the following aspects of health and safety: safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures, and hazards communications. In addition to the training received upon employment, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job that exposes the employee to new hazards. Our safety manual contains safe work practices, health and safety hazards, descriptions of the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. Emergency and first-aid procedures are also covered. Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he/she received and understood the required training.\n\nProtec Pac USA carries out well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: isobutane storage vessel, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel; training and procedure usage are also part of our maintenance discipline. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nWritten procedures are being developed at Protec Pac USA to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures"
