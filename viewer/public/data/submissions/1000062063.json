This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as receipt of containers and product, storage, and employee training associated with the chemicals at this facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nUnder the Accidental Release Prevention Program, responsibility for the proper handling and storage of toxic gases stored at this facility is overseen by the production manager and by the Compliance Assistant. Additionally, OXARC, Inc. senior management have responsibility to ensure facility managers and compliance personnel keep the program up-to-date and that all reports and findings are taken care of in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility is accessible to about 20 authorized employees and is secured during non-operational hours.  There are two substances at this facility above the threshold quantity: sulfur dioxide and chlorine (separate, not in mixtures) in cylinders with capacities of 150 pounds and 2000 pounds. The estimated maximum amount of sulfur dioxide on hand is approximately 32,000 pounds total in the containers listed above. The maximum amount of chlorine on hand is approximately 60,000 pounds in the containers listed above. There are no filling processes performed of either chemical at this facility. Only processes associated with sulfur dioxide and chlorine are the storage, loading/unloading, and transportation in and out of this location.\r\n\r\n3.\tGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThis facility has taken all of the necessary"
