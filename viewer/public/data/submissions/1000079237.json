      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\r\nAt the beginning of the 1900s water-borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.).  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine's introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S.  dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\r\n\r\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule in volume 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The goal of these regulations is to reduce the risk to employees, the public, and the environment by preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is regulated because it stores chlorine above the threshold quantity defined in these regulations.\r\n\r\nThe RMP Program Level 3 regulations are similar to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) rule in volume 29 CFR part 1910.119."

Preston WTP has always understood the risks associated with chlorine and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  The John E. Preston WTP's track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, the John E. Preston WTP has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP and PSMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe key element of complying with the RMP and PSMP rules is development of policies, operating procedures, maintenance programs, and emergency response plans to ensure the safety of employees and the public.  MDWASD is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to its employees and protecting the public, on-site and off-site property, and the environment from releases of chlorine.

The facility's mission is to protect public health by providing safe drinking water.  The John E. Preston WTP is located at 1100 West 2nd Avenue, Hialeah, Florida.  The plant is bounded by West 2nd Avenue to the east, West 13th Street to the north, West 9th Street to the south, and by West 3rd Avenue to the west.  The John E. Preston WTP covers 17.3 acres.  \r\n\r\nThe John E. Preston WTP stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule. The chlorine system at the John E. Preston WTP provides chlorine to the softened water to maintain required disinfection levels for drinking water.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the John E. Preston WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is delivered by the Florida East Coast Railway in 90-ton rail cars.  The rail cars are delivered to the John. E. Preston WTP via a spur to the chlorine car enclosure.  The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure. The liquid chlorine flows from the rail cars through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the Chlorine Room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms to ensure that normal temperature is maintained.  Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators. The chlorinators control the feed rate of the chlorine gas to the process.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces hypochlorous acid that flows through polyvinyl chloride piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\r\n\r\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine system is provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include emergency shut-off"

MDWASD will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the chlorine process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations evaluated, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\r\n\r\nThird-Party Audits:\r\nMDWASD has developed procedures to engage a third-party to conduct third-party audits when required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit:\r\nThe John E. Preston WTP requires that employees and contractors employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.  The John E. Preston WTP uses a permitting program to ensure that hot work is conducted safely on, or near a process involving chlorine.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History Summary:\r\nNo reportable releases/accidents have occurred at the John E. Preston WTP during the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary:\r\nMDWASD has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan (ERP) specifically-tailored to each facility that complies with 40 CFR 68 subpart E.  The following paragraphs summarize key elements of the MDWASD ERP.\r\n\r\nEmployees working with the chlorine process are Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) technician level trained.  The HAZWOPER-trained staff will respond to chlorine leaks.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Miami-Dade County Hazardous Material Team may be solicited to aid in handling a chlorine leak.  \r\n\r\nThe ERP has been coordinated with local response agencies (Fire Department, Miami-Dade Office of Emergency Management).  The main elements of the MDWASD's ERP are: (1) chlorine release response flow chart, res"

The PHA identified certain recommendations to improve safety.  MDWASD is currently evaluating the recommendations resulting from the May 23, 2019 PHA.  The key planned safety improvement at the John E. Preston WTP is to replace the elemental chlorine with sodium hypochlorite (bleach).  It is roughly estimated that construction of the proposed sodium hypochlorite facility will be completed in late 2021."
