This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor of Tucson has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (September 2002) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).
