In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used in conjunction while transferring chlorine.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment (dated April 6, 2004), the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Pool Chlor of Tucson's response plan is for qualified and trained operators to don SCBAs and mitigate the release.  Otherwise, if qualified and trained operators are not available Pool Chlor of Tucson will call 911 in order to reach the Tucson Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Pool Chlor of Tucson has a B-kit available at the facility in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool Chlor of Tucson has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (September 2002) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (April 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit have been completed.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
