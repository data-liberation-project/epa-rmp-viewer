AT OUR LOCATIONS THAT HANDLE ANHYDROUS AMONIA WE KEEP SAFETY GOGGLES, RUBBER GLOVES, AND RUBBER SUITS FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO WEAR.

THE LOCAL FIRE CHIEF IS AN EMPLOYEE, AND ONE EMPLOYEE IS A MEMBER OF THE GROOM VOL. FIRE DEPARTMENT.   WITH OUR DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WE CAN HAVE A TEAM ON SITE IN A VERY SHORT TIME.  WE ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO KEEP ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT IN TOP SHAPE, IN  ORDER TO KEEP ACCIDENTS TO A MINIMUM. WE HAVE HAD ONE ACCIDENT IN THE LAST 5 YEARS WITH JUST MINOR INJURIES. NO PROPERTY DAMAGE.--OUR FACILITY HAS: A.  A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29.CFR 1910.38;  B.

PERIOCIC EVALUATIONS ARE PREFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME.\nOUR WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF 90,000 LBS.
