The receiver checks the paper work for accuracy then forwards this to their supervisor for a double check from management then signed and dated. The truck is then backed up into an intrinsically safe unloading area with numerous safeguards to prevent release of pentane. Theses safeguards include the HMI that will not allow material to be pumped if its max volume is reached, the scully system to ensure the process is thoroughly grounded before allowing the material to be pumped. There are also both stationary and portable LEL detectors being used to ensure the atmospheric conditions do not reach an explosive level. These LELs are included in a mechanical integrity program and checked monthly. Only qualified operators shall perform these tasks and their competency in these tasks are evaluated by their supervisor or a member of management knowledgeable in these tasks. There is no smoking permitted on this property except in designated smoking areas that have been determined to be safe from the process. The mixing skid that has a 2-hour fire rating is where the Pentane is added into the process. This room is monitored with stationary LEL detectors and has an exhaust fan to evacuate an accumulation of vapors. The mixture is then pumped into a batch system and from there is pumped to the pour table and then the laminator. There is an exhaust fan that will continuously evacuate the volatile material from the laminator system and vent to the RTO. There are alarm levels built into the system. With any mechanical deviation an alarm will sound requiring the operator to correct the situation. At a 15% concentration of pentane an alarm along with a white strobe light will flash and shut the system down and activate the exhaust fan. At a 40% concentration of Pentane the emergency alarm will sound requiring all employees to evacuate the building and call for the Hillsboro Fire Department to assist.",

The Risk Management Program and Process Safety Program formalize and document these activities. Johns Manville is committed to conducting its operation in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substance handled:\n\nThis facility manufactures polyisocyanurate insulation panels for the construction industry. A flammable mixture containing two related substances, n-pentane and isopentane, is used in the manufacturing process. \n\n\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe hypothetical worst-case scenario is a failure of the 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to capacity, despite a 90% capacity limit, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to hazard modelling software, impacts from this explosion using the worst-case assumptions could cause injuries and damage property located in an area between the storage tank and the hazard endpoint. The hazard endpoint in this case corresponds to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) and is estimated to extend 0.4 miles from the storage tank.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a hose rupture caused by a truck that pulls away while the hose is still connected to the pentane tank. This would result in a spill of approximately 7 gallons (this amount is the maximum quantity of pentane that could be in the hose). If a spark were to ignite the spilled liquid and vapors, the resulting explosion could impact persons or property located within 150 feet of the unloading area. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of a pentane release in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard "

Some of the specific activities in the prevention program are described below.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAn in-depth Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the system has been conducted prior to start up and any following risk reduction measures will be implemented. Qualified personnel will revalidate the PHA every five years.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Pentane system was designed in accordance with all applicable codes and standards (NFPA, ANSI, ASME, etc.). A Pre-startup safety review will ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure that any change is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. Critical equipment is maintained, tested and inspected on a planned periodic basis to ensure proper operating conditions.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nWritten operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators. To complement the written procedures for process operations, Johns Manville has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the emergency operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented fo"

Personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nJohns Manville promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root causes and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Johns Manville periodically conducts an audit to evaluate whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
