This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the gas processing facility.  Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of an accidental release, trained gas plant personnel in conjunction with the Lamesa Fire Department will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility is located near Welch, Dawson County, Texas.  It is designed to process 20 MM scf/day of gas.  The overall process consists of a variety of processes to produce natural gas liquid (NGL).  The gas plant has several regulated flammables, including methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane.  In addition, the gas plant processes hydrogen sulfide (H2S) which is also a regulated substance. \n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the Program Level 1 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest vessel containing a mixture of flammable substances.  The maximum capacity of the vessel is 62,000 lb of flammables including non-regulated flammables.  It is assumed that the complete inventory is released and ignited, resulting in the VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.32 mile.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nA WCS associated with a release of a toxic substance is no"

Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nOXY USA Inc.'s Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples for employee participation range from review of system changes for plant processes to being a member of the Safety, Environmental, and Risk Engineering (SERE) team.  In addition, plant employees participate in many activities aimed at identifying and correcting potential hazards in the plant.  All plant employees must report unsafe conditions and acts.  All employees have the authority to shut down any work due to unsafe conditions or acts.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis information.  Specific personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

For specific areas within the plant, OXY USA Inc. has documented safety-related limits for process specific parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nOXY USA Inc. also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility has a comprehensive program to help to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analysis is performed by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations and includes all plant personnel.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are documented and are forwarded to and reviewed by Op"

All approved mitigation recommendations in response to PHA team findings are documented, and actions taken or not taken are recorded and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to Operations Management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operation, (3) temporary operation, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operation, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\n\nTraining\n\nTo support the written procedures for process operation, the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees are given an overview of the gas plant operations and procedures before being assigned to a process.  The overview includes training with emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform the work in a safe manner, (2) have the necessary knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
