Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards Plant 2 operates a table grape cold storage facility in Delano, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n?    (5) Precoolers\n\n?    (7) Cold Storage Rooms\n\n?    Refrigerated Hallway\n\n?    Shipping Area\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. All control valve groups are mounted on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within a refrigeration machinery room or directly outside near the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nMachinery Room\n\n?    (1) FRICK Model RXF-24 Compressor\n\n?    (1) FES Model 13L Compressor\n\n?    (1) Frick Model RXF-101 Compressor\n\n?

(12) Spiral Fin Aluminum Bunker Coils - 9 Rows Wide x 6 Rows High x 240\" Finned Length\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator above the high pressure receiver. From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards Plant 2 was built many years ago and has been modified by California Controlled Atmosphere several times in the last 20 years. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Each entrance to the machinery room contains emergency refrigeration and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidenta"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards Plant 2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 60,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards Plant 2 has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards Plant 2's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

Nevertheless, Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Columbine Vineyards Plant 2's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Columbine Vineyards Plant 2's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards Plant 2 has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Columbine Vineyards Plant 2 will continue to maintain overall plant worke"
