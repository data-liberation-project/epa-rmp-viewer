Red Shield Environmental will manufacture kraft market pulp at the facility commensing in May of 2007.  The mill is located on the Penobscot River in Old Town, Maine.\r\n\r\nThe facility produces northern hardwood and softwood pulp. Pulp is produced on one Kamyr continuous digesters. The pulp from the digester is piped to the bleach plant. The bleaching operations use chlorine dioxide, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Emissions from the chlorine dioxide stages of the bleach plant are collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber. Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and stored as a dilute aqueous solution. The emissions from this process are also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\r\n\r\n2.\tRegulated Substances and Process\r\nRed Shield Environmental operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance: chlorine dioxide generation and storage.

A process vessel (D1 pretube) had been rinsed with water and drained. The water rinse did not fully clean the pretube and the remaining stock drained onto the floor. Due to the high residual in the pulp, unreacted chlorine dioxide gas was evolved from stock in the area. The employee washed down the area and opened building doors to improve ventilation but later experienced respiratory discomfort and received prescriptions medications.\r\n\r\nF.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nRed Shield Environmental Old Town Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public and the environment. The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance.

This is an \"all risk\" system developed for on-scene management of any emergency event. The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact of personnel changes upon the emergency plan. Periodic emergency drills are conducted within the plant to maintain preparedness and to identify areas for improvement. The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes or facilities. In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC.

Old Town Mill has around-the-clock communications with the LEPC to ensure notification of the public in event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response.\r\n\r\nG.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRed Shield Environmental continually strives to improve operations at its facilities in order to reduce the potential of an accidental release to the environment. In 1999, the Old Town Mill replaced the chlorine bleaching system with an elemental chlorine-free system. The new system consists of chlorine dioxide oxidizing bleaching system. This change has resulted in the complete phase out of elemental chlorine from the mill. The use of chlorine dioxide greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the bleaching process. The elimination of elemental chlorine in the bleaching process has reduced the worst-case distance to toxic endpoint. Red Shield Environmental believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment.\r\n\r\nH.\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the off site consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors. Pubic receptors are off site residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release. Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentratio"

These analyses comprise the hazard assessment.\r\n\r\nI.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis for a Toxic Substance Release\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at Red Shield Environmental is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a storage tank containing 190,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution. In accordance with the definition of worst case for toxic gases under RMP regulations, the entire 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide, in solution, were assumed to be released over a ten minute period. Based on the structural integrity of the tank and interconnected piping, Red Shield Environmental considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning. Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than that of ambient air. For this reason, a concentrated plume resulting from a large accidental release would display dense-gas behavior. That is, the near-field dispersion would be controlled by gravitational \"slumping\" caused by the density difference. EPA's 1996 RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) lists a number of refined dense-gas dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs. Among these models is the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1). DEGADIS, developed by the U.S Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to simulate dispersion of dense-gas releases, is the only dense-gas model included in U.S. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (40 CFR Parts 51 and 52, Appendix B).

These low dispersion conditions are common at night with fair skies. No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine dioxide is set by regulation to 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L). This is equal to the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) level of 10 ppm, divided by a safety factor of 10 to account for sensitive individuals. The IDLH, developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is intended to protect healthy workers from irreversible health effects or escape-impairing symptoms for exposures of up to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies \"surface roughness\" as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees. 'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings or forests and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of Red Shield Environmental, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly ?urban? in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is more ?rural?, especially along the Penobscot River. In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Red Shield Environmental has elected to include only the modeling results obtained assuming ?rural? surface conditions.

The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 32,500, based on the 2000 Federal Census (Census 2000 TIGER/Line Data). The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, public recreation areas, environmental receptors (Sunkhaze Refuge) and industrial/commercial areas.\r\n\r\nJ.\tAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine Dioxide\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide solution is pumped from generation and storage to the bleach plant through a 6 inch diameter pipeline. The chlorine dioxide pipeline is supported by a pipe bridge, which is approximately 250 feet long. Normal solution strength is about 10.5 grams per liter.\r\n\r\nThis alternate-scenario is the rupture of the 6-inch diameter chlorine dioxide pipeline on the pipe bridge inside the bleach plant. It is assumed that the approximately 250 feet of pipe would drain before the flow could be shutdown. This would release 32.21bs of C1O2.\r\n\r\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*CompTM (Version 1.07) software. In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions. The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed). No mitigation of the release was considered. Because the surface roughness in the immediate vicinity of Red Shield Environmental is urban in nature, an urban surface roughness value was utilized in the alternative release modeling.\r\n\r\nThe estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.
