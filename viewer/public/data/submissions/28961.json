High pressure gas from the wells is sent to a high pressure separator with the gas being routed to a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in a 42,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank (administrative controls limits level to <50% of  tank) operating at approximately 115 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility either by pipeline or transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in a 4,000 barrel bulk atmospheric storage tank (administrative controls limits level to <50% of tank) and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. \n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances as indicated in the following  table:\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest vessel of 42,000 gallons (administrative controls limits level to <50% of tank) .  Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single larges"

The condensate storage scenario yields a distance to the endpoint of 0.2 miles. Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario uses administrative controls to limit the volume thus limiting the distance to the endpoint. At a limit of 50% capacity for the NGL and condensate storage tanks facility personnel will halt production until some or all of the product is removed. \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The operator is aware of the General Duty Clause in the Louisiana regulations (see Section 1.4 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Program\" document in the front sleeve of this plan) and accidental release prevention is a policy adopted by the operator.\n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
