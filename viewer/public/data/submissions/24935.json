      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy for West Bend Elevator is the following: Rodman  complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur at our Rodman location, signs are posted that refer to Jeff Bonnstetter who is employed by West Bend Elevator Co.  Signs also refer to Darrel Herscher who is employed part-time seasonally by West Bend Elevator Co. and is also a member of the Rodman Fire Dept.  Jeff and/or Darrell will decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is 50,490 pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 5,050 pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be 10 minutes.    According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 2.6 miles.  Rodman has 2 bullet tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  There are an estimated 150 people within this radius. Our alternative case scenario is a transfer hose failure.  This hose failure would result in a quantity release of 5,954 pounds of anhydrous each minute for a 2 minute period of time.  According to EPA lookup tables the distance to the toxic endpoint is .5 miles.  Within the radius of either scenario are residences and recreation areas.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA'S accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator Company holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees followed by an exam.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems. "

      "SummaryText": " Receiving ports include one-way valves to protect from product discharged during receiving.  Also within the past year we have installed steel barricades 8 feet apart around the perimeter of the bullet tanks.  These steel barricades are sunk to a depth of 4 feet below ground level and cemented for strength.  These steel barricades protrude 3 1/2 feet above ground level.  This should minimize vehicle contact with bullet tanks at the storage facility.  The bullet tanks are locked when the plant facility is closed to deter vandalism or accidental discharge of ammonia at the plant.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Rodman Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the County Disaster Co-ordinator, Rodman Fire Dept Chief and members.  The Rodman Fire Department has inspected our facility and is familiar with it.  We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans except as follows.  We are currently investigating the use of locking devices on nurse wagons to prevent or deter theft of ammonia for meth labs.   We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
