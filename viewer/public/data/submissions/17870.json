      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF LINDBERG'S RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n I. INTRODUCTION\nA. Background\nLindberg Heat Treating Company (LINDBERG), 284 Grove Street, Worcester, MA processes a wide range of steel and alloy metal products in heat treating furnaces to harden the material to customer specifications.  As part of its heat treating processes, LINDBERG uses anhydrous ammonia gas as a reactant.  The nitrogen component of the ammonia gas penetrates the outer layer of the metal being treated in a furnace and the reaction serves to harden the metal.  The residual ammonia and gaseous by-products from this process in the furnace are typically flared off. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is one of the toxic substances that is subject to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68).   These regulations require a subject facility to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) when a listed substance is handled, stored, manufactured, or used in certain quantities.  The RMP threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  Since LINDBERG has an anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a maximum capacity of 53,466 pounds at its facility, it is required to have a Risk Management Plan. No other chemical at LINDBERG exceeds the RMP thresholds of applicability.\n\nII. LINDBERG'S RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nLINDBERG's Risk Management Plan, of which this Executive Summary is a part, complies with the specific requirements in EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) for Program 3 processes.\n\nA. RMP*Submit Data Elements\nThe files submitted to EPA during October, 1999 include the data elements completed using EPA's RMP*Submit program and two graphics files (*.jpeg) portraying the radii of the zones of impact for the worst-case release and the alternative release scenarios.  Please refer to the RMP*Submit files for the complete submittal made to EPA. \n\nB. Chemical Safety and Prevention\nAnhydrous ammonia requires proper storage and handling precautions to prevent exposures to co-wo"

It is LINDBERG's goal to meet or exceed, where possible, all state and Federal requirements regarding protection of the environment.  As such, the management at LINDBERG has implemented numerous measures to prevent, mitigate, and respond to accidental release of ammonia at the facility.\nAt LINDBERG, managing the risks and hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia begins with the employees.  It is LINDBERG's policy that only trained, experienced Lindured and Nitriding Process Technicians operate the associated equipment. Furthermore, all employees are encouraged to make recommendations to further ensure safe handling of ammonia.\nA review of past deliveries of anhydrous ammonia indicate that typically 15 tons (30,000 pounds) were delivered when the storage tank volume approached 10% (about 5,500 pounds). With this historical perspective LINDBERG has decided to formalize limiting deliveries of ammonia to not exceed 15 tons by including it in the Process Hazard Analysis section of its PSM Plan as an administrative control.  As a practical matter LINDBERG's Purchasing Department will limit deliveries accordingly.  With this control in place LINDBERG will be able to reduce the quantity of ammonia on site from a maximum tank capacity of 53,466 pounds to no more than 40,000 pounds thereby reducing the area of toxic endpoint in a worst-case scenario.\nThe installation, inspection protocol and routine maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia storage and supply system at LINDBERG are in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI K61.1-1999), Compressed Gas Association (CGA G2.1-1999) and OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111) guidelines and recommendations. \n\nAnother key aspect of LINDBERG's prevention program is its compliance with OSHA's PSM Plan.  The PSM Plan includes a Hazard Analysis that identifies problems that may lead to a release and/or exposure to ammo"

PSM Plan also evaluates training, maintenance, management of change, and inspection activities related to proper use, storage, and handling of ammonia.\nFinally, LINDBERG's 5-year accident history shows that there has not been an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes configuring a given release scenario (e.g., worst-case) and predicting the maximum distance to the edge of the impact area (called the zone of impact).  CAPACCIO used guidance from EPA to define the release scenarios for the alternative release and the worst-case release.  CAPACCIO used EPA Reference Table 23 from Section 10 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis to estimate the distance to the Toxic Endpoint for an Alternative Release Scenario.  To determine the Worst-Case Scenario, CAPACCIO used EPA Reference Table 9 from the same source to estimate the distance to the Toxic Endpoint.\nThe concentration of ammonia that defines the zone of impact is based on EPAs Exhibit B1 Data for Toxic Gases. The endpoint represents a safe level of exposure below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.  The endpoint for ammonia is 200 parts per million in ambient air.\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is the more probable release for the facility.  For the alternative release scenario, EPA allows the facility to define the conditions of the release using reasonable judgement, process knowledge, and practical assumptions.  As opposed to the worst-case release scenario, the alternative release scenario becomes the more realistic accident scenario.  CAPACCIO used the following parameters to determine the zone of impact for the alternative release scenario:\n7 The scenario is that a one inch (outside diameter) schedule 80 ste"

In this instance, the excess flow valves that would shut down the supply of ammonia were assumed to fail.\n7 The release rate is 17.5 pounds for ammonia per minute for 60 minutes.\n7 The meteorological conditions are representative of average atmospheric stability (D stability) and 3.0 meters per second wind speed.\n7 The release takes place outside the building in an open area with no mitigation.\n7 The release from a break in the pipe would be in a gaseous state and would be considered to be neutrally buoyant.\nThe result of the alternative release scenario for LINDBERG was a distance of 0.1 miles.  Using EPA-approved methodologies, CAPACCIO determined that there are no schools, hospitals, correction facilities, recreation areas, or sensitive environmental receptors within the zone of impact.  However, there are residences, commercial and industrial receptors within the zone of impact for LINDBERG's alternative release scenario. CAPACCIO estimated that the population within the zone of impact to be 80 people using EPA-approved methodologies.\nRefer to the attached graphics file called lhtalter.jpeg for an illustration of the zone of impact superimposed onto a street map of the region.\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nThe EPA prescribes the worst-case release scenario.  Every facility subject to RMP must evaluate the worst-case release using the same parameters.  For toxic gases, the release must incorporate the following parameters:\n7 The release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure over 10 minutes.\n7 Meteorological conditions are representative of worst-case atmospheric stability (F stability) and 1.5 meter/second wind speed.\n7 Release at the ground level, regardless of the actual location of the vessel or process.\n7 Only passive mitigating measures (such as building enclosures) may be incorporated into the modeling.\n7 The anhydrous ammonia in the"

The result of the worst-case release scenario for LINDBERG was a distance of 2.3 miles.  Using EPA-approved methodologies, we determined that there are schools, or sensitive environmental receptors within the zone of impact.  In addition, there are commercial and industrial areas, recreation areas, residences, day care centers, schools and hospitals within the zone of impact for LINDBERG's worst-case release scenario.  We also estimated that the population within the zone of impact is 83,561 people using EPA-approved methodologies.  \n\nD. Emergency Response Program\nIn spite of the fact that LINDBERG has never had an ammonia release, LINDBERG has prepared a Process Safety Management Plan to ensure rapid response in the event of an accidental release. Training of key emergency response employees is currently underway. The upgrade of the tank distribution system and emergency shutoff valves is planned for the near future.  In the event of an emergency that may potentially impact the community, the Worcester Police Department will notify residents and businesses."
