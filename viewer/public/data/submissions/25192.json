Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company Valley City Litchville are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nIf such a release does occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Barnes County Emergency\nManagement Agency, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have up to\n140,000 pounds anhydrous ammonia stored in a fixed  tank at our Sanborn Facility (Figure 1).  \n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe worst case and alternative case release scenarios for this facility were modeled Cenex Harvest\nStates who utilized the DEGIDIS model.   The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (140,000 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\nthe toxic endpoint is 1.16 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a the endpoint is 32\npeople.\n\nThe alte"

The estimated population within this endpoint is 4 people.\n\n  \n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville maintains a detailed record of safety\ninformation that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs\nassociated with all processes (Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville maintains written operating procedures\nto ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures\naddress various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible\nto operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville has a comprehensive training program\nin place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating\nprocedures associated with these processes (Appendix C).\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville conducts documented maintenance\nchecks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.

Examples of process equipment\nthat would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems,\nrelief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment\ndeficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner\n(Appendix D).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Sanborn Ammonia Facility to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville routinely conducts pre-startup safety\nreviews related to new processes and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are\nconducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are\nsuitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville conducts compliance audits on a regular\nbasis to determine whether the plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being\nimplemented.  Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Farmers Union Oil Company of Valley City Litchville truly believes that process safety\nmanagement and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged\nto express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
