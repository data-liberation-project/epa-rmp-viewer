The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Martinez Plant utilizes a regeneration process to manufacture various strengths and grades of sulfuric acid. Its acid is used in the gasoline manufacturing process at refineries, metals mining, processing pulp and paper, agricultural chemicals and pesticides, and water treatment. The only chemical stored and used in the Martinez Plant that is covered by the EPA RMP regulation is anhydrous ammonia (NH3). The Plant uses anhydrous ammonia at its abatement tower to control sulfur dioxide emissions. This process generates ammonium bisulfite as a by-product fertilizer that is sold seasonally. \n\n3. Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case and alternate release scenarios for this RMP update and re-submittal, Martinez Plant used the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, and MARPLOT software for estimating population and for mapping.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) for ammonia stored on site is the release of the total contents of the storage tank of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) over a 10-minute period. No credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario.  \n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for ammonia stored on site was selected from the results of the process hazard assessments that were completed for the ammonia storage unit. The ARS associated with the release of ammonia at the Martinez Plant is a leak in the hose during the unloading of an ammonia tank truck.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Martinez Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68 for this covered process.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is i"

The methodology used for these analyses are HazOp/Checklists.  The studies are performed by a cross-functional team of qualified personnel with expertise in risk analysis, engineering, process operations, and maintenance.  All process hazard analyses are revalidated every 5 years.  Any findings resulted from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, the Martinez Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.. The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  All operating procedures are reviewed and recertified annually.\n\nTraining\nThe Martinez Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure all operations personnel are competent in the operating procedures associated with the processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Martinez Plant carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these inspections include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.  Maintenance procedures are performed by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices and the potential hazards associated with each unit.  Fu"

All corrective actions are tracked via a computerized work order management system.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Martinez Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  All changes are reviewed for potential health, safety, or environmental concerns.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change and training is provided on the modification.  All relevant documentation and drawings are updated as part of the action items resulting from the changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Martinez Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operation and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also performed for any process that has been idle for longer than six months.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Martinez Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years.  The plant's personnel are responsible for developing an action plan to address all recommendations resulting from audits in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Martinez Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in the release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent recurrences.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information related to the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulted from process hazard analyses.\n\nApart from their participations in process hazard analyses, pre-startup safety reviews, and management of change reviews, employees are encouraged to participate on various health, safety, and environmental improvement teams that are active on site.\n\nContractors\nOccasionally, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  It is the Martinez Plant's policy to inform the contractors of the processes and known potential hazards related to the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of all the emergency response procedures should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors working onsite are expected to work according to all of the safe work practice policies in place for our employees. \n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Martinez Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period that meet the EPA definition of an RMP-reportable release.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Martinez Plant maintains a well trained emergency response team and a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Martinez Plant has developed a strong safety culture and embraces the continuous improvement of its safety program. Although no major changes are currently planned, the Martinez Plant implemented the following noteworthy changes that have improved safety and significantly reduced the overall risk footprint since the 2004 RMP re-submittal: \n\n1. In November 2004, the Plant completely ceased the production of oleum, de-inventoried, sanitized and isolated the oleum production unit.\n2. In August 2006, the Plant implemented a significant reduction in its maximum onsite inventory of anhydrous ammonia through administrative control."
