We will properly train, equip and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThis policy shall be communicated to all employees and made available to the public.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activities at Dynea are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced from the processing of methanol delivered to the plant via rail car and tank truck.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 53.5% by weight. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Dynea are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Dynea?s program elements have been expanded to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Dynea?s PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whethe"

      "SummaryText": "r the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nDynea Toledo has had no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n \nEmergency Response Program\nDynea Toledo has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Dynea to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde.  Dynea employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs."
