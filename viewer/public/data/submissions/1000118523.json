This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia system. The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of prepackaged agricultural chemicals to farmers, including the regulated substance, aqueous ammonia. \n\nAqueous ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 25,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqueous ammonia, based on 24% ammonia by weight and conversion rate of 7.54 lb/gal, is approximately 93,000 pounds.\n\nBased on the facility's NAICS code (42491 Farm Supply Merchant Wholesalers), the facility is required to follow the EPA RMP and the CalARP Program 2 for aqueous ammonia as required by the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA, the Sutter County's Environmental Health Division.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the worst-case release scenarios is defined as a release from the largest storage vessel at the facility. The most recent Hazard Assessment report contains details on the modeling.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the alternative-case release scenarios is defined as a release scenario that is more likely than the worst-case release scenario. The most recent Hazard Assessment report contains details on the modeling.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalational hazard; and thus, the use of aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community.

Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility employs a regional Environmental, Health and Safety Specialist to facilitate training and RMP implementation. As part of the implementation of CalARP Program 2 for aqueous ammonia, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of aqueous ammonia. Prevention elements for Program 2 are listed below:\n\n- Safety Information (SI)\n- Hazard Assessment (HA)\n- Operating Procedures (OP)\n- Training (TRN)\n- Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n- Incident Investigation (II)\n- Compliance Audits (CA)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no reportable releases of aqueous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWilbur Ellis - Yuba City is exempt from the emergency response requirement; however, there is an emergency plan in place covering response to releases, and it is presented in annual emergency response training for all involved personnel.  The facility does meets the following criteria:\n- Annually filing of the Hazardous Materials Business Plan is completed for Sutter County. \n- Coordination with the local Fire Department. \n- Established procedures to notify emergency responders as part of the \"Pre-Fire Plan/ Emergency Procedures.\" All Yuba City employees are trained in these procedures. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements. To improve the safety of the aqueous ammonia system, Wilbur-Ellis is in the process of implementing non-destructive tests to evaluate the mechanical integrity of the tanks. At a minimum, inspection frequencies will follow industry sta"

Recommended improvements and identified deficiencies from the inspection checklists, compliance audits, and PHA studies will be included on the facility CAPA log along with the priority, employee responsible, and targeted completion dates.\n\n1. Update operating procedures to address criteria outlined in company-wide management system. \n2. Replace NFPA diamond on the oil-based liquid product storage tanks. \n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describes methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety, and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing incidents and employee injuries by combing the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
