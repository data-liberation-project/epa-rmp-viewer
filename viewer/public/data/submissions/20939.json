      "SummaryText": "Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses one chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is Ammonia for the refrigeration system.  We currently have maximum storage capacity of 16,000 pounds of Ammonia at the Decatur facility.\n\nWayne Farms LLC-Decatur believes that the RMP chemical that we store and handle on site has very real and potential dangers.   However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators, techniciansand HazMat Team\n4. periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading its processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nWayne Farms LLC-Decatur also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Decatur Fire Department.  The Morgan County Fire Department has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur facility.  The Decatur Fire Department conducts annual site visits to our facility and is prepared to respond to a possible spill or leak.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling, storage and operation of ammonia and utilize outside ammonia experts to periodically inspect our systems integrity, train system operators and upgrade systems to improve safety.  As a result of Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur's safety program, Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur has had no releases of ammonia which resulted in any off site injury or illiness in the past five years.\n\nBecause of the large quantities of ammonia Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur maintains on site there is a"

      "SummaryText": "very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur uses EPA's OCA Guidance for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (16,000 pounds in 10 minutes), a .7 mile radius around the Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur facility may have to be evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 149 people in the surrounding community may be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.   \n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nProcess piping leaks could result in 500 pounds of ammonia being released over a 10 minute period.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance Model, this 500 pound release of ammonia could travel less than .1 miles and could effect 3 members of the general public. \n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms LLC-Decatur believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms LLC has taken to minimize these dangers.  Wayne Farms LLC-Decatur has a long-great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Morgan County."
