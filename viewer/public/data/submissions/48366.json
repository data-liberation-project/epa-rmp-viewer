Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that:\n     (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, \n     (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, \n     (3) training for all affected employees is complete, \n     (4) a process hazard analysis has been performed and \n     (5) process hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed and \n     (6) actions required for start up have been completed.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nXII.     Incident Investigation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nERCO trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, injuries to employees, the public, or impact the environment.  Incident investigations are designed to determine the facts, identify the root causes, and provide recommendations for ensuring that the incident does not recur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved.

The procedures include all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and other medical procedures, the use of emergency equipment, the use of personal protective equipment, evacuation plans, and community emergency response notification procedures.\n\nProcedures for maintaining emergency response equipment are also contained in the emergency response plan.  There are procedures that address maintaining, inspecting, testing, and using the critical equipment needed in an emergency.  Employees receive periodic training in the duties they are expected to perform during an emergency, and any change in the emergency response plan is administered through the management of change process so that affected employees are notified.\n\nThe emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.

We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care\u00ae.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling of chlorine.  \n\nERCO is in compliance with the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care\u00ae Security Code.  A security vulnerability analysis has been conducted and ERCO has implemented comprehensive security procedures and improvements such as perimeter digital video camera system, improved perimeter lighting, and an access control system.  A transportation security plan has also been implemented including necessary training of affected employees.\n\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.

Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves which limit the amount of chemical released, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate personnel protective equipment, and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  Should a release occur, we use a dispersion model, Systematic Approach For Emergency Response (SAFER), and meteorological data from our weather tower to predict the plume direction and size, downwind ground-level concentrations, and the estimated time at which the plume will reach off-site areas.
