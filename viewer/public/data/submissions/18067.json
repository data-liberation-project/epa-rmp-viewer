Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nPrevention to reduce an accidental release include:\n  7 Quarterly inspections of the tank, and all valves\n  7 Emergency response policies are included in the Spill Prevention, Control & Countermeasures/Installation Spill Contingency Plan (SPCC/ISCP), dated April 1998  \n  7 On-site personnel are trained to respond to accidental releases\n  7 On-site 24-hour Fire Department\n\nb. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n  7 Primary Activity:  Newport Chemical Depot (NECD) is an U.S. Army Installation that stores and safeguards the nerve agent VX.  NECD's Major Command is the Army Materiel Command.  NECD is a Government Owned/Contractor Operated (GOCO) facility.  Mason & Hanger Corporation is the current operating contractor.  There is no production on-site at the installation.\n  7 Use of Regulated Substance:  Propane, CAS# 74-98-6, flammable, is the regulated substance.  Propane is processed in an propane-air station to create a mixture to fuel generators for heat and energy.  The system was installed in 1995 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  7 Quantities Handled or Stored:  There is a maximum of 14,400 gallons, 61,056.0 pounds, or 27,694.5 Kg (at 600 Fahrenheit) of propane that can be stored in the 18,000 gallon aboveground storage tank. \n\nc. Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nWorst-case scenario is a release scenario which creates an explosion, releasing 100 percent of the chemical in a vapor plume at ambient temperature and pressure.  The worst-case for a 100 percent release, with 10 percent of the total release exploding in the vapor plume, would travel 0.32 miles. The closest public receptor is located 0.58 miles from the propane tank.  Calculation for the worst case release scenario is located in the Offsite Consequence Analysis.  \n\nd. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nSinc"

Five-year Accident History\n\nNo accidents have occurred at Newport Chemical Depot during the previous 5 years.  The propane tank was installed and filled in 1994.\n\nf. Emergency Response Program \n\nOn-site trained personnel, as well as on-site 24-hour trained First Responder/EMT Fire Department personnel, coordinate with local fire departments.  Coordination also is with the Vermillion County Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\nProgram 1 criteria does not require compliance with 40 CFR 68.95, Emergency Response.\n\ng. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nFurther consultation with USA CHPPM to improve safety measures."
