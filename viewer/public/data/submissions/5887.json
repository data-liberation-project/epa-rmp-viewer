      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR SUPERVALU, INC. CRANSTON RI\n\n  SUPERVALU has begun its facility risk management program by defining the process.  The process at the perishable facility is one of refrigeration.  To define would be to say that the anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant to absorb heat from an insulated vault area and maintain temperatures of -10 f, 28 f, and 34 f.  The process of absorbing takes place through evaporators that are suspended from the ceiling of the vaults. The anhydrous ammonia is pumped into these evaporator air handlers with the use of sealed pumps at the rate of 4 to 1 ratio.  This means that 4 times the amount of refrigeration is pumped in to the evaporator that can be boiled off during the refrigeration cycle.  The refrigeration is then recycled to the pump packages.  The screw compressors maintain the pressures required to maintain the desired temperature, by sucking a vapor off the top of the pump packages.  This vapor is then compressed into a high-pressure gas and piped to an evaporative condenser on the roof of the facility.  The high-pressure gas is then condensed by removing heat from the refrigerant pipes by passing water and air over them, thus condensing the high-pressure gas into high-pressure liquid.   This liquid then drains into a high pressure liquid receiver.  The level of refrigerant in the pump packages is maintain by a float switch allowing liquid refrigerant into the low stage and high stage pump packages, each having its' own float switch.  This liquid is supplied by liquid in the high pressure receiver.  There, the process being performed is one of boiling (therefore absorbing heat) and condensing (therefore rejecting heat into the atmosphere) within a closed loop system. \n \n\nThe facility's approach to chemical safety is taken from the Supervalu Ammonia Hazard Control System (SAHCS).   Within SAHCS are the following policies:\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n  We have on-going process safety meetings.  Employees, management"

Employees have been involved in every aspect of the PSM program.  There have not been any additions to the process since installation of the original equipment.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe contractor information that was compiled during construction is complete.  Although we, through the process hazard analysis have approached all aspects of the information to confirm these facts.  Since the process involved is one of refrigeration , the majority of the information needed is compiled on the M.S.D.S.  Toxicity permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, corrosive data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous of inadvertent mixing of different materials all are contained on the M.S.D.S. and are on file.  It is also covered by our hazardous communication program posted in the warehouse.  \n\nINFORMATION ON TECHNOLOGY OF THE PROCESS\n\nBlock flow diagrams have been made on a one-line diagram for simplicity.  They include the zone valve locations for quick reaction by untrained eyes.  The as built mechanical drawings and electrical diagrams are readily available in the maintenance office.  They are updated to show changes that have occurred.\n\nMAXIMUM INTENDED INVENTORY\n\nThe Cranston facility has 17000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  Since our process is one of refrigeration all of our equipment is and has been purchased and sized for the pressure and temperature relationships of NH3.  Each and every aspect of the process has been examined by hazard analysis.   \n\n\n\n\n\nEVALUATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEVIATIONS\n\nSupervalu feels that since all of the equipment involved has been chosen with respect to NH3 that there are no deviations,  therefore no consequence.\n\nMATERIAL OF CONSTRUCTION\n\n                  Documentation on site.\n\nPIPING AND INSTRUMENTS DIAGRAMS\n                  \n                  Documentation on site\n\nEL"

Cranston RI division is a warehousing and distribution facility built in 1987 and expanded in 1989 for the storage and distribution of perishable food products.\nThe operation consists of three shifts receiving, storing and shipping of approx. 250,000 cases per week of frozen food, meat, poultry and dairy/deli products.\n                 The main building is constructed of steel masonry and cooler panels and is alarmed and sprinkler equipped.   It is approximately 200,000-sq. ft. sitting on 66 acres about 1-1/4 miles west of I-295 on the south side of route 14.  The garage is located at the extreme rear of the property just at the end of the main building.  The garage facility is used for the sole purpose of servicing our own fleet.\nThere are no basements in either of these facilities.\nThe main building is refrigerated using NH3 or Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant and the main machine room is located on the second floor at the approximate center of the building. There are also hose stations strategically located around the cooler sections of the building and loading docks.\n\n\nWORSE CASE SCENERIO\n\n                Total release: 17,000.  Although highly unlikely because the refrigerant is contained in three vessels: low stage pump package, high stage pump package and high-pressure receiver.  Other than an explosion of the total facility, each vessel would contain approximately 5000 lbs. with the remaining refrigerant in piping, evaporators and condensers.  If a rupture occurred and the vessel pressure dropped to 0 PSIG or atmospheric pressure, the ammonia temperature would quickly change to the temperature pressure relationship of - 26F.  Most of the refrigerant would then lay in the vessel and not cause th"

This would allow for emergency measures, mitigation and response to be taken to capture the refrigerant.\n                 If there was an explosion, caused by possibly an airplane crash or terrorist causing the total release of the refrigerant there would be an offsite impact that we have estimated to be 2.2 miles using the EPA's RMP Ammonia Refrigeration Guidelines.\n\nFormulas used: 17000 lbs/100 mins=1700 lbs. (RPM guidelines permits 60 min) Refer to RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (40 CFR Part 68).  Chapter 4 page 4-11.  Exhibit 4-4 Distances to Toxic Endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia Liquefied Under Pressure F Stability, Wind Speed 1.5 meters per Second.\n \n\n   If during this explosion which caused the rupture and release of the total charge, the sprinkler system would also rupture mitigating a large concentration of the release. This would cause an environmental impact that is far less of an impact than the human aspect of a release.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE:\nPipe Rupture: Because of the use of fork trucks in the facility the possibility exists of the hitting and rupturing a pipe or evaporator which could cause the release of approximately 5000 lbs. of Ammonia. There are devises on each of the vessels (low level floats) which will shut down the ammonia pumps, which would cause and immediate pressure drop. The immediate impact would be within the facility. Shortly after this facility impact an offsite impact could occur which we estimate as being 0.2 miles.\n\nFORMULAS USED:\n5000 lbs/60mins = 83 lbs./min.
