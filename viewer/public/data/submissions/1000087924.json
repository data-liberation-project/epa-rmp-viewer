This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted as the five-year RMP update.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases.

This coordination effort has included providing the agency with a copy of our EAP, and providing a site diagram and hazardous material information, meeting with South Holland Fire Department personnel to discuss the facility's operations/processes, and encouraging p"

CBQ is currently implementing their Process Safety Management Program. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for CBQ. \r\n\r\nXI.\tManagement Program\r\nCBQ has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Currently, David Streeter, Director-Occupational Safety and Security, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program."

CBQ has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\r\n\r\nIII.\tFacility Identification\r\nThe CBQ facility is located at 15600 South Wentworth Avenue in South Holland, Illinois.  CBQ is an importer, manufacturer and distributor of quality pork. Specializing in ribs, both domestic and imported, the company sells to both retail and foodservice customers around the country. \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating coolers, freezers, and production areas at the facility. The amount of ammonia in System 1 is approximately 23,000 pounds and the amount of ammonia in System 2 has been calculated at approximately 9,700 pounds, for a total of 32,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the facility. \r\n\r\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \r\n\r\nV.\tHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \r\n\r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in acc"
