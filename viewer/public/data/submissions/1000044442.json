      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.\n\n\n\nChlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in finished drinking water, to protect public health and to comply with state and federal water quality standards.  \n\n\n\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The John E. Preston WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals seriously, as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\n\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and an update to the RMP every five (5) years.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the chlorine process, including a description of the possible consequences if the procedures are not followed, and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of a chlorine release.\n\n\n\nThe following information is provided below in this RMP Executive Summary:\n\n    * Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\n\n    * General Facility and regulated substance information.\n\n    * Summary of the accidental release prevention "

Preston WTP is located at 1100 West 2nd Avenue in Hialeah, Florida.  John E. Preston WTP is bounded to the east by West 2nd Avenue, to the north by West 13th street, to the south by West 9th Street and to the west by West 3rd Avenue.  John E. Preston WTP covers 17.3 acres.  The facility stores chlorine which is regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to John E. Preston WTP via 90-ton rail car by FEC Railroad.  The FEC delivers all rail cars via a spur to the John E. Preston chlorine rail car enclosure.  The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The rail car enclosure has a capacity of four cars but typically houses only two chlorine rail cars.  The chlorine system at John E. Preston WTP provides chlorine to the softened water to maintain required disinfection levels for drinking water.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the John E. Preston WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity of the RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nThe pressure of the stored chlorine forces the liquid through the tubing and into the manifold system. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the rail cars through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located i"

The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas meter and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\n\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include, but are not limited to emergency shut-off valves, chlorine leak detectors, audio and visual alarm system, isolation valves, high and low temperature alarms, high and low pressure alarms, pressure regulators, expansion tanks, bursting disks, and pressure relief valves.  Chlorine \"C\" Kit and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus are available in the event of a chlorine release.  These major safety features are located in the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator room.\n\n\n\nEmergency shut-off valves are located at the rail car valve, and immediately after the monel transfer hose or a \"whip\". Downstream of the manifold system there is also a pneumatically actuated emergency shut-off valve.  Pressing one of the emergency shut-off switches (kill switches) activates the emergency shut-off valves.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure and in the chlorinator room.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency shut-off valves in the chlorinator room are the same as those located in the chlorine car enclosure.

As with the valves in the chlorine car enclosure, the shut-off valves in the control room are operated manually by pushing the emergency shut-off button located on the exterior wall of the chlorinator room.\n\n\n\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine car enclosure is activated when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, audio and visual alarms (both local and in the control room) are activated.  When the chlorine alarms are engaged, personnel are restricted from entering the chlorine area without the appropriate personnel protective equipment.  A chlorine leak detection and alarm system like the one in the chlorine car enclosure is located inside the chlorinator room.  \n\n\n\nA perimeter fence and locked security gates surround the John E.

Security guards are posted 24 hours a day at the entrances to the plant and at the chlorine storage area.  There is also a roving security patrol of the perimeter fence.
