The facility stores TDI in 3 secured indoor diked above-ground storage tanks in a separate tank room. TDI is delivered via railcar and stored in an attached indoor railcar unloading building and occasionally by tank truck and unloaded in a designated diked area just outside the tank room.\n\n\n\nThis FXI facility has implemented an accidental release prevention programs which includes process safety information according to documented plans as regulated by the NJ DEP TCPA and DPCC/DCR Programs.\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on a five year schedule or as required by a process hazard analysis team. The team is organized by a process risk management consultant and is typically composed of a team leader, process engineer, EHS Manager, and any other employees that may contribute to the analysis. Results and recommendations are recorded in a documented program.\n\n\n\nStandard operating procedures (SOPs) and Job Hazard Analysis (JHAS) are written by the EHS Manager using the technical process description in cooperat"

Understanding the training is assured by on the job observation, written tests, oral exams and demonstration of a person's performance skills.\n\n\n\nThe Preventive Maintenance/Mechanical Integrity Program is delegated to the Plant Engineer and/or Maintenance Manager. The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, instrument lists and specifications, pipeline lists and specifications, equipment history of repair and replacement, preventive maintenance procedures and demand work order procedures. Job hazard analysis, work permits, hot work permits, and lockout/tagout are used in conjunction with the program.\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change Program is quality assured by the facility's department managers. It is composed of a written program with elements to assure that repairs and replacements are documented and completed according to corporate guidelines.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program compliance audits are conducted annually by the EHS Manager in cooperation with the facility managers and supervisors. Deficiencies are documented, scheduled for improvement and monitored by the EHS Manager.\n\n\n\nThe Incident Investigation Program follows guidelines for fact determination, root cause analysis, and recommendation review, implementation and documentation.

Mitigation systems used are sprinkler systems, firewalls, and chemical neutralization. The process and unloading areas can be monitored by portable TDI monitors and two permanently mounted continuous read TDI monitors located at the storage tanks and pourline head.
