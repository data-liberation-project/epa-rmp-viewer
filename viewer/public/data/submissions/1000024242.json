      "SummaryText": "Note:  This facility was previously known as the DuPont Victoria Plant.  On April 30, 2004, the facility assets (except for the Ethylene Copolymers operations) were purchased by INVISTA S.a.r.l. (formerly known as Arteva Specialties S.a.r.l), a private company owned by a subsidiary of Koch Industries.\n\nA.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAs an INVISTA facility, this site operates under INVISTA EHS Policy and Management Systems are used to assess compliance on a regular basis.  These INVISTA documents are available via the corporate and site intranet.  The EHS procedures are available to employees through the plantwide intranet.  The 800 series of procedures in particular deal with Process Safety and Risk Management requirements.  In addition, the Victoria Plant Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\nB.  SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe INVISTA Victoria Site consists of 4500 acres, located approximately 9 miles south of the city of Victoria, Texas, in a rural setting south of SH 185.  About 1000 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 100 acres for bio-treatment and wetlands, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.\n\nThe site consists of manufacturing processes to produce Nylon Intermediates (hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid and dodecanedioic acid).  In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used or produced as intermediates:\n- Anhydrous Ammonia\n- Aqueous Ammonia\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n- 1,3 Butadiene\n- Chlorine\n- Hydrogen\n- Natural Gas\n\nC.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe INVISTA Victoria Site's Nylon Intermediates process follows the requirements of the INVISTA Process Safety Management Compliance Standard.  This Standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nOur Safety Programs include:\n\nD"
