Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Monument Chemical facility in Brandenburg, Kentucky is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, security, and environmental protection.  Monument Chemical Kentucky, LLC has been certified by the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA) to have been accessed and found to be in conformance with the requirements established by the CHEMSTEWARDS&reg; Management System. A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as to protect the environment.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nb.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Monument Chemical Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site including the following production units; Propylene Glycol/Glycol Ethers, Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities, Wastewater Treatment.  The primary products manufactured at the facility include polyether polyols, propylene glycols, glycol ethers, and microelectronics chemicals.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\n?    Ethylene Oxide - Used in the production of polyether polyols and ethylene glycol ethers; maximum quantity handled/stored at \n\n        the facility is 960,000 pounds.\n\n?    Propylene Oxide - Used in the production of polyether polyols, propylene glycol, and propylene glycol ethers; maximum \n\n        quantity handled/stored at the facility is 4,200,000 pounds.\n\n?    Formaldehyde - Used in the Microelectronics Unit for the production of Novolak solutions; maximum quantity handled/stored at \n\n        one location in the facility is 30,000 pounds.\n\n?    Acrylonitrile - Used in the Polymer Polyol"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our PSM management systems uses each pillar to maintain successful prevention programs. As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\n1.    Administratively limit the inventory for toxic chemicals handled at the facility, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, \n\n        and acrylonitrile.  \n\n2.    Operator's always in attendance during transfers and trained on release and spill prevention measures to take immediate \n\n        action if needed and safe to do so.\n\n3.    Conduct extensive in-process and effluent wastewater monitoring in excess of NPDES permit requirements for derivatives of \n\n        ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.\n\n4.    Reduced process uses and storage volumes for formaldehyde and ethylenediamine by product elimination.  \n\n5.    Upgraded ethylene oxide storage tank mechanical integrity by replacing insulation and adding stainless steel sheathing.  \n\n        Upgraded storage tank"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRecords are maintained for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  During the past five years, the Brandenburg facility has experienced no RMP chemical releases to the atmosphere which have caused injuries to plant operators.\n\n\n\n\n\ne.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan has been developed for the Brandenburg facility in order to provide an effective and efficient response to any type of incident.  The Emergency Response Plan addresses all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning.  To assist us in the event of an emergency, local area emergency responders have been provided with our Emergency Response Plan.  The Meade County Fire Department is responsible for notifying the public of any release which has potential off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nf.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Brandenburg facility has planned facility improvements that will help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  The safety of our processes and procedures are continuously under review. Process hazardous analyses, as well as Security Vulnerability Assessments are a few of the methods we use to create actions and projects to improve our systems. A variety of recommendations are being implemented as a result of our participation in this program, including:\n\n\n\n1.    Increased operator training for emergency response activities.\n\n2.    Continued drills to include the local fire department and LEPC.\n\n3.    Continued capital equipment upgrades for existing facilities to prevent chemi"
