If an emergency related to the ammonia storage system were to occur, it is our policy to initiate our on-site emergency response program.\n\n\n\nDescription of facility and regulated substances handled:  This facility manufactures silicon carbide wafers and semiconductor devices for the microelectronic and other industries.  Hydrogen and Ammonia are used in the manufacturing process.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is stored in six storage tanks with a total capacity of 230,080 lbs. Hydrogen is stored in a combination of tanks and storage tubes with a total capacity of 13,582 lbs.\n\n\n\nAmmonia - The worst-case release scenario is the failure of one 50,313 pound tank resulting in a vapor cloud.  Using EPA's Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 2.35 miles.  Off-site public receptors include a residential population of approximately 7500, and recreational, commercial, retail and light industrial facilities within the Research Triangle Park and the City of Durham.\n\n\n\nHydrogen - The worst-case release scenario is the failure of the 6434-pound tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using RMPCompTM, the distance to the toxic endoint is .2 miles.  Off-site public receptors do not impact any major use areas.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The facility has developed and implemented the requirements for an OSHA PSM Plan for the facility.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  Cree has not had an accident involving the Bulk Ammonia or Bulk Hydrogen system that resulted in death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place. \n\n\n\nEmergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia or hydrogen s"
