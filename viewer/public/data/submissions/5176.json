The EHS group conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of aqua ammonia. The field supervisors require a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\n Each location has a 'site safety coordinator' as an extension of the EHS group.

The site safety coordinators act as the location emergency contact.\n\nDescription of our facility and the regulated substances handled.\nThis facility stores liquid 24% Aqua Ammonia for use in manufacturing other liquid fertilizer solutions. Aqua Ammonia is received by truck, handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We mix aqua ammonia solution with other fertilizers to make various grades of liquid fertilizer and/or micro nutrients. The liquid fertilizer or micro nutrients are plant foods applied to the soil for growing agricultural crops.  \n\nAqua ammonia is stored on site in one 30,000 gallon stationary storage tank, within concrete secondary  containment.  This storage tank is our largest single storage vessel at our facility and it contains 228,000 pounds of 24% aqua ammonia, representing  approximately 65,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nWorst case scenario\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the one 30,000 gallon storage tank to the secondary containment dike released as a liquid over 74.5 minutes with ammonia being released as a vapor. The maximum quantity released would be 65,000 pounds of ammonia.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a pipe leak, from a stationary storage tank resulting in a 2,000 pound release of aqua ammonia over 43.2-minutes. The total amount of ammonia released in this scenario would be 500 pounds. This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\nThe aqua ammo"
