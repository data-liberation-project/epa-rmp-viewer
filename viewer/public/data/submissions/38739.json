Chlorine is received at the facility via 90 ton railcars. It is repackaged into 17 ton tank trucks, 1 ton containers, and 150 pound cylinders. Additionally, the facility manufactures sodium hypochlorite (bleach) using chlorine as a reactant.  The second operation is a sulfur dioxide container handling and storage process.  Sulfur dioxide containers, 1 ton containers and 150 pound cylinders are received at the facility and stored pending delivery to consumers. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Sierra Chemica Co., Stockton Facility, has developed the following programs in the efforts of accidental release prevention: Process Safety Management Guidelines (Sierra Chemical Co. Document HS180.10) and the Accident Prevention Program (Sierra Chemical Co. Document HS105).\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History: Sierra Chemical Co., Stockton Facility, has had no reportable accidents per EPA 40 CFR Part 68 in the past five years.  The facility did experience a process upset due to operator error resulting in the release of chlorine gas on 27NOV99.  There were no injuries or off site impacts as a result of the incident.
