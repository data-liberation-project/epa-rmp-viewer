A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water Disinfection process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \r\n\r\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the Plant Chief Operator to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0  City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances, chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \r\n\r\nProcess Description: Disinfection\r\nProgram Level: 3\r\nRegulated Substances: Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0  Hazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nThe City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur Dioxide from our process.

By identifying these potential releases, the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\r\n\r\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\r\n\r\n  Chlorine:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\r\n\r\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sulfur Dioxide:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, 150 pound cylinder of liquid sulfur dioxide.

Within this program, the Disinfection Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nTo perform the PHAs, City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant primarily uses the What-if/Checklist technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Disinfection Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.
