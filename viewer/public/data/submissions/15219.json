Each scenario impacts a circular area with the Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) at the center of the release.  Because the locations of each release are different, the affected areas overlap.  A separate population estimate has been made for each scenario.

In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes chlorine and hydrogen fluoride, which are regulated toxic substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for toxic substances is a failure at the Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) Alkylation Unit resulting in a ten minute release of 255,000 lbs. of HF from the HF Alkylation Unit de-inventory vessel.  For this WCS, the distance to the toxic endpoint (or ERPG-2 value) of 20 PPM is 51,900 feet or 9.8 miles. Although we have controls to prevent releases of this nature and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThis quantity of HF is present in the de-inventory drum at a frequency of about 4 weeks every four years.  Under actual storage conditions, the HF which is stored as a liquid, would not instantly vaporize.  Ambient conditions would determine the rate at which a vapor cloud would be generated.  However, under EPA RMP modeling requirements, all of the release is assumed to be discharged into the air and no pool is formed.  Therefore, the distance reported for this release may be overstated.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for HF at the refinery is a ten-minute release of 13,020 pounds of HF from a one-inch hole in the reactor settler area.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (or ERPG-2 value) of 20 PPM is 3,990 feet or 0.8 miles.  Neither active or passive mitigation systems were used to evaluate this scenario.  Under actual release circumstances, the duration of the release would be limited by transferring the reactor settler contents to the emergency de-inventory vessel.  Also, the water mitigation system installed at this unit would be activated during an HF release and reduce the amount of HF that would become airborne.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine is a twenty-min"

In addition, the EPA RMP rule requires that all of the material  instantly vaporize upon release when in reality the secondary worst-case scenario would form a liquid pool upon release and then be contained in a diked area, thus substantially reducing the amount that would vaporize.\n\nTherefore, each of the WCS's result in distances that may be over-stated.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Butane at the refinery is the failure and subsequent ignition of 227,000 lbs of butane from a 350 psig, 4 inch pipeline at the plants' North property line adjacent to the Southwest Trafficway.  No active or passive mitigation systems were used for this scenario.  The rupture is assumed to ignite and result in a flame jet (i.e. a torch fire) pointed horizontally away from the release.  The distance to reach the endpoint of concern of 5 kw/m2 is 0.15 miles (818 feet).\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the refinery.

To date, 21 different teams have been organized to analyze issues selected from a survey of employees.  The teams work to improve safety by implementing new approaches to procedures, practices and methods.  These teams will also remain involved to monitor the progress and the effectiveness of the individual issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe El Dorado refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help sustain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits on key process conditions, specific chemical inventories and equipment design parameters.  Each process unit has safe upper & lower limits identified in associated operating manuals.\n\nThe plant maintains a process safety information document that lists the type of information, where it is located and the department responsible for updating the information.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to determine that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe El Dorado refinery has a comprehensive program to identify for the various processes the potential hazards that may be created as a result of deviations from the design intent.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and verify that adequate safeguards are in place to mitigate and/or control the circumstances.\n\nThe El Dorado refinery primarily uses the industry recognized Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) method as the basis for process hazard analysis studies.  The HAZOP study is considered one of the most comprehensive of all available qualitative hazard assessment techniques.  This technique utilizes the services of a multi-disciplined team, usually composed of four to seven members, typically representing operations, engineering, maintenance and safety.  The objectives of the study are to identify the causes and consequences of potentially hazardous or inefficient operating conditions and to identify safeguards in place, which would mitigate and/or control the circumstances.  A systematic process is used to identify a variety of possible scenarios, which may lead to hazardous situations, recommend improvements in the areas of safety and operability and document the findings.\n\nRecommendations may be made to improve the efficiency of the equipment or unit and/or to render less likely the probability and extent of damage or injury in the event the equipment does not operate as designed or human error were to occur.

After review, management may elect to implement the recommendation as stated, recommend further study or not implement the recommendation.  The review and follow-up process can be facilitated through an action plan, which documents the status of the recommendations made in the study.  The action plan should include a listing of the recommendations, a time frame for addressing each recommendation, an individual designated to address each recommendation and the action being taken.  The progress of this action plan is monitored until all recommendations for an individual HAZOP study are completed and resolution documentation is on file.\n\nTo assure the hazard analysis is consistent with the current process, the refinery updates and revalidates the hazard analysis for each process unit at least every 5 years.  These will be conducted on a 5-year cycle until the process is no longer operating.  The 5 year hazard analysis reviews are conducted, considered, documented and closed in the same manner as outlined in the paragraphs above for the original hazard analyses.  To date, over 35,000 man-hours have been expended in conducting process hazard analysis studies at El Dorado.\n\nFor changes to the refinery processes, different process hazard analysis methods may be used depending on the complexity of the change.  If the change is large in scope the HAZOP method is used.  For smaller and less complex changes, a checklist method may be used.  Checklists that have been developed at EDRC for use are the What-If Checklist, Tie-In Checklist and Design Capacity Review Checklist.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures have been developed to provide instructions for safely conducting activities involved f"

The basic aspects of this program include conducting training, maintaining written procedures, performing inspection and tests, correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on both an overview of the process including safety and health hazards and applicable maintenance procedures to allow them to perform their work in a safe manner.  The safety department maintains information regarding an overview of the process units and the engineering, training and maintenance departments maintain procedures necessary to maintain the refinery equipment.\n\nInspection and tests are performed in accordance with plant and industry standards to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  Documentation of inspection and tests is maintained and equipment deficiencies that are identified are corrected.\n\nQuality assurance is another integral part of the mechanical integrity program.  The El Dorado refinery incorporates quality assurance in new construction, new equipment installation and maintenance activities.  This is necessary to assure new equipment, maintenance material and spare parts and equipment are suitable for the  process application.  Quality assurance is also accomplished through checks and inspections to assure it is properly installed and consistent with design specifications and industry standards.\n\n\nS"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit or procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a confined space procedure.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe El Dorado refinery has a comprehensive system to manage facility changes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, or procedures be properly authorized and reviewed before being implemented.  To assure proposed changes are properly reviewed and documented, the management of change procedure at the El Dorado refinery requires certain activities to be performed by various departments.  These activities begin once scope definition is completed and include reviews of engineering design, process hazard analysis, safety, environmental, operator training, maintenance training, construction, inspection, testing and pre-startup.  Affected equipment and chemical information, as well as procedures are updated as necessary to incorporate changes.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nThe refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

On January 10, 1997 an operator received minor burns from exposure to a few drops hydrogen fluoride while withdrawing a small amount from a test port.  There were no offsite consequences from this incident.  On October 24, 1998 an operator received a burn injury from a butane release and fire that was the result of the failure of a pump bearing and seal.  The second-degree burn was to the employee's hand and he returned to normal duty without any lost time.  There were no offsite consequences as a result of this incident.  An additional incident was reported because it was similar in size of the release to the alternative release scenario selected for hydrogen fluoride.  On September 18, 1998 the failure of a pipefitting resulted in the release of 12,000 pounds of hydrogen fluoride, but with no onsite or offsite consequences.
