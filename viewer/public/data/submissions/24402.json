Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Underwood Farm Supply are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Pottawattamie County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 310,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the of the total contents of the storage tanks released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capaity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point is 3.3 miles.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario, a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 13,500 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is .5 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Io"

The OSHA standard is referenced in this registration form, Section 8.3(b).\n\n5. Five year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or enviromental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to ascess the condition of the facility. There are no additional specific safety reccomendations reguarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
