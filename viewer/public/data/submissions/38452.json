The Sea Robin Gas Plant identified potential candidates for the worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow Tang methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the maximum endpoint for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 460 feet(.087 miles) from the center of the explosion resulting from an instantaneous release of 168,358 lbs of inventory contained in the Product Surge Tank/Accumulator. The maximum distance beyond the plant boundary fence is 160 feet which does not affect a public or environmental receptor. Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the Executive Summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowlwedge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognizing safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n\u00b7 A commitment to OSHA's PSM and HAZWOPER standards and EPA's RMP regulations, which promote and require adherence to process safety activities, designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\u00b7 Development and use of Amerada Hess Corporation and Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant safety, operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n\u00b7 Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized standards, specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction and operation of faci"

The plant is across the street from the Henry Complex operated by Bridgeline Gas Distribution LLC, a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco Exploration and Production. The plant contains regulated flammables, such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL). The main components are Ethane, Propane and Butane within its process areas.  \n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR68.10(b)91). Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker,  public safety and the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures addresses emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.
