To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods (insert facility location), this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods (insert facility location), has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n   Poultry slaughter plant, further processing etc.)\n \n   Regulated substance:Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant\n \n   Amount of each regulated substance:20,000lbs. of Anhyrous Ammonia\n  \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  10,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of  10,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.8 miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.

      "SummaryText": " The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had 0 releases in the past 5 years of this type.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations         Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n    Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  \n5.  Five-year accident history.\n     (NONE)\n\n6.   The emergency response program.    \nA fully trained and equiped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures, Post Incident Critique, and Personal Protective Clothing and Emergency Equipment.\n\nAll Hazmat courses at Tyson Foods, Inc., are designed to meet training requirements of the OSHA "
