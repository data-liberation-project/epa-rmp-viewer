The Facility Policy\n\n        The management and employees of Fairfield Non-Stock Co-op Fertilizer Association are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n       \n       -The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n       -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production \n        nutrients.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n           An analysis of the off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternate-case accidental \n     releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management        \n     Program.       \n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n                The faciity has implemented the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n        - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n        - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,\n         property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\n        - The facility has:\n\n        a. a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n        b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n            information as requ"
