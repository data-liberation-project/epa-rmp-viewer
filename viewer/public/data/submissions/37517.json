We\r\nuse a combination of accidental release prevention programs\r\nand emergency response planning programs to help ensure the\r\nsafety of our employees and the public as well as protection\r\nof the environment.  This document provides a brief overview\r\nof the comprehensive risk management activities that we have\r\ndesigned and implemented, including:\r\n     A description of our facility and the storage and\r\n     transfer of substances regulated by EPA's RMP\r\n     regulation\r\n     A summary of results from our assessment of the\r\n     potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical\r\n     releases\r\n     An overview of our accidental release prevention\r\nprograms\r\n     A five-year accident history for accidental releases of\r\nchemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n     An overview of our emergency response program\r\n     An overview of planned improvements at the facility to\r\n     help prevent accidental chemical releases from\r\n     occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the\r\n     public, and the environment\r\n\r\n2    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nNisseki Chemical Texas Inc is a chemical manufacturing\r\nfacility located in Harris County, Texas.  The plant\r\nconsists of reactors, distillation columns, storage tanks\r\nand shipping and receiving facilities for bulk tank trucks\r\nas well as rail.  Nisseki primarily manufactures chemicals\r\nused in the carbonless copy paper, electrical capacitor and\r\nEPDM rubber industries.  As a result of the processes some\r\nby-products are produced and are sold as fuels and solvents.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the chemicals handled at Nisseki are non-\r\nhazardous.  However,"

      "SummaryText": "Nisseki does have three regulated\r\nflammable chemicals under the Risk Management Program.\r\nThese three chemicals are Butadiene, Propylene and Butene-1.\r\nNisseki does not store or process any of the listed toxic\r\nchemicals.\r\n\r\nThese two chemicals have been identified to have the\r\npotential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a\r\nsubstantial release.  Off site consequences were determined\r\nassuming maximum possible inventory even though the\r\ninventory of these chemicals is often reduced or removed.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our\r\ncontingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the\r\nhazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the\r\nenvironment in the storage and transfer of these chemicals.\r\n\r\n3    KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about\r\nthe worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release\r\nscenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief\r\nsummaries of these scenarios, including information about\r\nthe systems to limit the exposure distances for each\r\nscenario:\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario (WCS)-Flammables\r\n\r\nThe WCS would be a Butadiene explosion.  Butadiene can be\r\nstored in greater volume and has a higher vapor pressure\r\nthan Propylene or Butene-1 and therefore has the potential\r\nfor greater offsite consequences.  This scenario would\r\nrequire the instantaneous failure of the tank walls, the\r\nfailure of all active safety systems, worse case weather\r\nconditions, a maximum inventory and total release of the\r\ncontents of the tank.  There would also need to be an\r\nignition source available to ignite the vapors resulting in\r\nthe explosion of all vapors.  The true potential for this to\r\noccur is nil.  Assuming that it did occur the offsite\r\npressure wave would not reach any public or environmental\r\nreceptors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS's)-Flammables\r\n\r\nNisseki identified the greatest potential for a release\r\nscenario to be a leak"

      "FacilityID": 37517,
      "SummaryText": ".  Nisseki Chemical receives Butadiene\r\nvia bulk rail cars that is off loaded by a compressor into a\r\nstorage tank.  This scenario assumed the rupture of a two-\r\ninch unloading hose.  The unloading area is not contained\r\nand the leak was assumed to last for ten minutes.  The\r\nescaping vapor could be ignited by an unknown source causing\r\nan explosion.  In this scenario an overpressure of 1 psi\r\nwould barely leave one corner of the plant.  Again no public\r\nor environmental receptors would be affected.\r\n\r\n4    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\r\n     CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing\r\naccidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management\r\nsystems address each of the key features of successful\r\nprevention programs including:\r\nProcess safety information, process hazard analysis,\r\noperating procedures, training, mechanical integrity,\r\nmanagement of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits,\r\nincident investigation, employee participation, hot work\r\npermit procedure and contractor safety.\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the\r\nfollowing chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n1.   All tanks are pressurized with pressure relief to a\r\n  control device.\r\n2.    Pressure, temperature and level instrumentation\r\nincluding alarms.\r\n3.   All key parameters are monitored in a central control\r\nroom\r\n4.   Systems are pressure tested before chemicals are\r\nintroduced\r\n5.   Tanks are built and installed per ASME and NFPA Codes\r\n6.   Automatic Shutdown\r\n7.   Area leak detectors\r\n8.   All components are dedicated to Propylene and Butene-1\r\nservice\r\n9.   Storage tank for Propylene has fireproof insulation for\r\npassive protection in a fire event.\r\n10.  Propylene compressor system has automatic shutdowns on\r\nhigh temperature, high level and high or low pressure.\r\n11.  Seal less pumps are used to eliminate leakage due to\r\nseal failures\r\n12.  Remote valves to isolate and limit the release"

Nisseki has Mutual Aid agreement with other industrial\r\nneighbors (CIMA).\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work\r\ntogether to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our\r\ncompany and our employees are committed to the standard that\r\nthese management systems set for the way we do business, and\r\nwe have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure\r\nthat we are meeting our own high standards for accident\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\n5    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical\r\nreleases that occur at our facility.  There have been no\r\nreleases since our original start up of operation in June of\r\n1994.\r\n\r\n\r\n6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe maintain an emergency response and contingency plan,\r\nwhich consolidates all of the various federal, state, and\r\nlocal regulatory requirements for emergency response\r\nplanning.  Our program provides the essential planning and\r\ntraining for effectively protecting workers, the public, and\r\nthe environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore,\r\nwe coordinate our plan with the community emergency response\r\nplan and we are members of the local Mutual Aid Association.\r\nElements of our emergency response plan that reduce the\r\nimpact on the defined receptors are: Fire protection\r\nequipment, community alert system, water curtain\r\ncapabilities to minimize releases, alarm systems, trained\r\nresponders and communication links to off site responders.\r\n\r\n7    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning\r\nto implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better\r\nrespond to accidental chemical releases:  Upgrading of\r\nprocess control system (DCS), installation of sophisticated\r\nflow meters to prevent contamination and leaks.
