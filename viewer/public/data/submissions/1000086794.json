      "SummaryText": "The Cargill Kitchen Solutions - Lake Odessa, MI primary business is processing wholesale distribution of egg products for human consumption. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP was resubmitted in April 2020 to meet the five-year anniversary date by which you must next update your RMP. Changes to site contacts, as well as the facility's RMP preparer were also made as part of this update.\n\n\n\nFacility release modeling was performed using EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp in addition to ALOHA software and Marplot. The methodologies reported in CDX reflect conservative modeling approaches to meet the endpoint criteria. The worst-case scenario is based on the high-pressure receiver as that vessel could potentially hold the largest quantity of ammonia. No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenario. For the worst-case scenario, smaller quantities handled at higher process temperature or pressure were considered. The report and supporting information contained herein only specify the final selected worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is based on a release from vessel V-8, a surge vessel containing ammonia that supplies cooling to a plate and frame glycol chiller.  The normal operating contents of this vessel are 5,320 lb. of liquid ammonia and it is assumed that the entire contents will be released through a failed relief valve on the vessel over the course of 20 minutes. Other alternate cases were considered including, overpressure situation from a pressure relief valve, vessel overfilling, over pressurization scenarios, "

      "SummaryText": "pipe ruptures and material handling and transfer hoses. Alternate release scenarios including shipping container mishandling, breakage, or puncturing that could lead to a spill were not considered because the facility does not handle shipping containers containing anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/ RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility has an emergency action plan in place and conducts periodic response drills and coordinates with the local fire department and LEPC. The facility is committed to continually improving safety through program implementation and execution. The facility has not experienced a release incident that meets the EPA's 5 Year Accident Reporting criteria involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The refrigeration system can also be manually shut down via emergency switches located outside the machinery roo"
