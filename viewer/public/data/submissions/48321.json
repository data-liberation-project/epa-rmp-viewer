As of 2/9/2006, UAP Distribution, Inc., is the owner of this facility.  Mr. Dan Niblock will act as the emergency contact and is the operations manager of this facility.  \n\nFor more information regarding this plan, contact Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; Dan Niblock, UAP, 3 Miles West Highway 24, Hoxie, KS (785) 675-3354.\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\na) The owners, management and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc. are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nA) This facility has been owned and operated by UAP Distribition, Inc. since February, 2006.  The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 106,000 pounds based on filling storage and nurse tanks to the designed capacity of 85%\n\nB) The primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia to farmers as a crop nutrient.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nA) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of the storage tanks being released over a 10 minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 53,0000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest tank filled to 85% capacacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nB) The alternate-case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity release would be approximately 12,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 0"
