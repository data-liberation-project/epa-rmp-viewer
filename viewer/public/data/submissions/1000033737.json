The Facility Policy for Washington\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of  White River Coop \r\nAre committed to prevention and accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities. To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information.\r\n\r\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. The maximum quantity stored at any of our facilities would be626726 lbs of aqmmonia  The maximum quantity handled at any given time would be the unloading of a Semi truck Holding 9000 gallons.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\n\tA. The worse case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 1 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 124865 LBS, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.7 miles.\r\n\r\nB The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .1 miles.\r\n\r\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K41.1, published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health"
