The plant did not fall under the 10,000 lbs. threshold for anhydrous ammonia until completion of a recent expansion in the fall of 1998. The only covered chemical contained on our site in quantities covered by the above regulations is anhydrous ammonia. The introduction of the PSM and RMP programs began in early Jan. of 1999 and since then the programs have been adopted into one on-going management process that includes members of both management, production and operational/maintenance staff. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n    -  Employee Participation Program\n    -  Process Safety Management\n    -  Process Hazard Analysis\n    -  Operating Procedures\n    -  Training Program\n    -  Contractor Safety Program\n    -  Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n    -  Mechanical Integrity Program\n    -  Hot Work Permit Procedures\n    -  Management of Change Procedures\n    -  Incident Investigation Procedures\n    -  Compliance Audit Procedures\n\nThe program has been reviewed with the Klingerstown Fire Dept. and county HAZMAT teams. Suggestions by these outside agencies have been warmly received and incorporated where feasible.",

We have a strong commitment from both our management and operating personnel to operate and maintain our facility in both a safe and responsible manner.\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our central plant refrigeration system in a similar way or function as \"Freon\" acts in a home or automobile air conditioning system. Ammonia is used to cool our product in spiral and  blast freezers and maintains our raw ingredients at proper temperatures in cold storage rooms. Ammonia is also used to cool our packaging and shipping rooms giving our product improved shelf life. The ammonia at our facility is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside our steel piping, coils, exchangers and vessels. The ammonia refrigeration system has been expanded in three phases with the initial or first phase of the system installed  in 1995 and the most recent or third phase of installation was completed in 1998.  The entire ammonia refrigeration system is monitored and controlled by a computer based control system. We believe that ammonia provides the most environmentally friendly, safest and efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\nA. Describe the accident release prevention and emergency policy.\n\nPapetti's Hygrade Egg Products, Inc. takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases from our ammonia refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increases that could cause a system failure, We also have implemented a PM or preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the overall integrity of the system. Additionally, we have on-going training programs for both safe operating and emergency procedures to ensure that our facility is operated by qualified personnel and to re"

Stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Klingerstown facility operates a refrigeration system with an inventory of approximately 24,182 lbs. of ammonia. This ammonia used in our refrigeration system represents the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Klingerstown facility.\n\nC. Summary of worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario from the Klingerstown, PA plant, as defined by the EPA, is the release of all the ammonia from the largest vessel on site. At our Klingerstown plant, this release would be 13,270 lbs. of ammonia over a ten (10) minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver. The lbs. represents the maximum allowable amount of ammonia that would be contained in the receiver at any time. This scenario as defined by EPA also requires us to assume that the weather conditions during a worst case scenario release would have almost no wind and no mixing in the atmosphere.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at the Klingerstown plant would involve the release of 2,430 lbs. of ammonia over a thirty (30) minute period due to the rupture of a 3/4\" high pressure vapor  tube/pipe located in or on one of condensers. The duration of the alternative release scenario was estimated by the amount of time required to identify the leak,  isolate the equipment and stop the leak or evacuate the ammonia from the piece of equipment. Once again, the impact of this release also assumes the release occurs under both low wind and stable weather conditions per EPA requirements.\n\nThe two (2) above release scenarios are extremely unlikely for many reasons.  Our equipment and system were designed using industry standards specifically for ammonia refrigeration. We have taken precautions to protect our equipment from obvious threats s"
