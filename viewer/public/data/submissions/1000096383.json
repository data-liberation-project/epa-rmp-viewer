      "SummaryText": "The City of Midland, Texas (City) operates the T-Bar Rechlorination Station (T-Bar or Facility).  The City of Midland's T-Bar Facility is located at 4111 N FM 1788 in Midland, Midland County, Texas.  The Facility disinfects well water prior to distribution to rural customers, wholesale customers, and prior to use as supplemental water at the City's Water Purification Plant (WPP).  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the Facility.  Up to 20,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at T-Bar.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  T-Bar is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c); ?68.155(b)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Assistant Utilities Director is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include a commitment to safety and the implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified operators are proficient in perf"

Certified operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Facility has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe Facility complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and the Texas Administrative Code.  The Facility is located outside of the Midland city limits, but the Facility is included in the county-wide Emergency Response Plan.  Coordination activities are conducted in accordance with ?68.93 with the first responders [the City of Midland Fire Department] and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) at least annually, and more frequently if necessary.  T-Bar is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Facility's operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Facility.  The City of Midland Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (?68.90(b)).\n\n\n\n"
