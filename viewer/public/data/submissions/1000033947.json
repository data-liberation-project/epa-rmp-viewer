ACE Ethanol is committed to operating the facility in a safe manner for the sake of both the employees and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nACE Ethanol has two chemical products that are required to be included in this Risk Management Plan: aqueous ammonia and the natural gasoline that is used as a denaturant for ethanol.   \n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia 30% by weight, is stored in two tanks; tank #1 holds 6,000 gallons; and tank #2 holds 9,400 gallons.  Both tanks are in secondary containment units that will hold the contents of the largest tank.  The tanks are equipped with a vacuum/pressure breather valve and pressure safety valve.  Level indicators and level gauges are installed at the load in station.  A high level alarm is also installed in the tank and monitored at the DCS.  Procedures require that plant staff monitor transfers between delivery trucks and the storage tanks.  \n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is used to denature the fuel grade ethanol in concentrations up to 2.5%.  The denaturant is stored in a 41,900 gallon tank.  The denaturant tank is stored in a secondary containment unit that will hold the contents of the largest tank.  Pressure safety valves are installed on piping sections that could be isolated.  Local level indicators are present at the tanks farm.  A separate level indicator is monitored at the DCS.  The DCS also includes alarms for high and high-high conditions.  Procedures require that plant staff monitor transfers between delivery trucks and the storage tanks.  Procedures are in place for all load out operations to rail cars and tanker trucks.  Spill containment systems are installed at the truck and rail load out racks.  The rail load out scully is equipped with level sensors that automatically shut off flow if a high level is indicated.  \n\n\n\nACE Ethanol has developed a Risk Management Plan Prevention Pro"

      "SummaryText": "gram per 40 CFR Part 68. Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as change management and incident investigation are conducted on an as-needed basis. ACE Ethanol has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify potential risks associated with the use and storage of these chemicals and has implemented the recommended changes that resulted from the PHAs.  Audits of the overall RMP are be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nACE Ethanol has not had an accident related to the covered processes which has caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  We believe that this record is largely due to the training program each of our operators and maintenance staff is required to complete prior to working independently within the facility.  This training includes written coursework, on the job training with experienced staff, and a final evaluation.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a serious release from the facility, ACE Ethanol has coordinated response activities with the Stanley Fire Department and Chippewa County.  Contract response services are also available from Waste Research and Reclamation of Eau Claire, Wisconsin."
