At this point in the treatment process, poly\nphosphate is also added to stabilize the water (limited\ncorrosion inhibition is also provided by the poly phosphate) and\nfluoride is added for dental health purposes.\n\nFiltration of the softened and recarbonated water is performed\nin two double bay, dual media filters.  The media in the filters\nconsists of 12 inches of anthracite, 12 inches of sand, and 16\ninches of various grades of gravel below the sand and anthracite\nfor support.
