ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nIt is Hancock FoodsA? policy to adhere to all applicable federal, State, and local laws.  The ammonia refrigeration process at Hancock Foods (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  Hancock Foods has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of compressed ammonia systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \n\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan as required under OSHA-PSM, Hancock Foods has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\n2.    FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nHancock Foods is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the blast freezing of freshly harvested blueberries.  The berries are then stored in a cold storage freezer.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia within three separate processes:\n\n-    Cold Storage Ammonia Refrigeration System: 5736 Pounds (Max. intended inventory)\n-    Flow Freeze Ammonia Refrigeration System:  4854 Pounds (Max. intended inventory)\n-    York Tunnel Ammonia Refrigeration System:  6909 Pounds (Max. intended inventory)\n\nTwo of the processes are co-located (Cold Storage and Flow Freeze), with compressor equipment, low pressure receivers, and Intercoolers located in the same area of the facility.  The York Tunnel system is isolated from the two other processes because it is located in a separate area of the facility.\n\nThe ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As Hancock FoodsA? co-located anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program"

The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at Hancock Foods are the only processes that store a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because it is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\n3.     THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with American National Standards Institute / American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) guidance, and American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) guidance as documented in Hancock FoodsA? PSM Plan.  Process verification takes place through design audits by trained personnel and/or certified consultants.  The schedule of such verifications is at least once every three years.  \n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of Hancock FoodsA? daily operations.  PM is performed on a regular schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM.  Ammonia detection sensors are present at six locations (engine room and freezers one through five) and are tested several times a year.  Relief valves are replaced, inspected, repaired, tested and/or sealed on a five-year schedule.  Differential pressure gages are replaced immediately upon discovery of any damage that may breach the integrity of the compressed ammonia process.\n\n4.     FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the last five years, Hancock Foods has not had an accident involving compressed ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n5.     THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in the engine room and freezers one through five.  A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.   High and low liquid alarms are present on the ammonia s"

An alarm signal is triggered and would sound and light throughout the facility, and the exhaust system would be activated by facility maintenance personnel.  An alarm is also activated at ADT.\n\nIn the event of a process release, ADT calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the Ellsworth Fire Department if any of the following conditions are present:\n\nA?    Upon investigating the incident, Hancock Foods determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance; \nA?    Reportable quantities of ammonia are released; and\nA?    A potential for fire exists (in this case, ADT directly notifies the Fire Department).\n\nThe Ellsworth Fire Department is trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at Hancock Foods.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nHancock Foods conducted a prevention program compliance audit in conjunction with the 5-year revision and resubmittal of its Risk Management Plan.  Several findings were identified as a result of this compliance audit.
