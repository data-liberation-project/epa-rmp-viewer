EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  68.155\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Public Works Department operates the City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 located at 1100 Sandpiper Lane, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  This plant is one of six water and wastewater plants operated by the City.  Wastewater plant # 1 and four other plants have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n1.1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (a)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach, Florida Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n1.1.1. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (a)(1)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach has a management system in place which is lead by the Utilities Director, which oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  This program, along with other City wide and plant specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n1.1.2. PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (a)(2)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in the plant\u00c2\u00bfs OSHA PSM program.

Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used as part of the treatment process. \n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach.  The site is located at 1100 Sandpiper Lane, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  The site is boarded by Sandpiper Lane on the east, Jordan Road on the north, Jordan Street on the west and Levy Road on the south.\nThe Plant includes a chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two regulated substances on site which exceed the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine and dechlorination processes were installed as part of the process of treating wastewater to make it meet strict FDEP discharge permit requirements.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\nSulfur dioxide is an EPA-and"

It is a dechlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 5 ppm OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Sulfur dioxide is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted for each regulated substances which include two chlorine and two sulfur dioxide release scenarios.  The first is a \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00c2\u00bfthe &#61628; shall assume that the &#61628; maximum quantity in the largest vessel &#61628; is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00c2\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00c2\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\u00c2\u00bf.\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the \u00c2\u00bftoxic endpoint.\u00c2\u00bf  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00c2\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00c2\u00bf  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \u00c2\u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected.\u00c2\u00bf\n1.3.1.\tWORST CASE   (c)(1)\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment for the worst case scenario was perfo"

The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at __ people.\n1.3.2.\tALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nThe alternative release scenario for each regulated substance involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA wastewater guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine or sulfur dioxide release is 20.0lbs/min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is ____miles.  The residential population potentially that would be impacted by this release is ___.\n1.4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 site program.  The second is the chlorine and sulfur dioxide-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire Department.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below:\n\u00c2\u00bfThe City of Atlantic Beach has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\u00c2\u00bfThe DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n\u00c2\u00bfTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.

Equipment Design\nThe chlorination systems and like sulfur dioxide system design has four distinct zones or types of pipe design or specification for chlorine is:\n\u00c2\u00bfHigh pressure liquid chlorine\n\u00c2\u00bfHigh pressure vapor chlorine\n\u00c2\u00bfVacuum pressure vapor chlorine\n\u00c2\u00bfChlorinated water liquid system.\nThe pipe design for sulfur dioxide is: \n\u00c2\u00bfHigh pressure liquid S02\n\u00c2\u00bfHigh pressure vapor S02\n\u00c2\u00bfVacuum pressure vapor S02\n\u00c2\u00bfSulfonated water liquid system.\nBoth the high pressure liquid and vapor systems are designed to three times the normal high pressure of the DOT shipment container.  Materials are primarily of steel construction or like materials, which are compatible with (corrosive resistant to) anhydrous chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\nThe vacuum system is designed to operate at 13 inches of water vacuum pressure (less than atmospheric pressure).  The piping and fittings are made of chemical resistant PVC, glass or like materials.  The system is designated to 150 psig pressure or complete vacuum.\nBoth water systems are made of steel and PVC pipe, and like compatible materials.  The system is designed for chlorinated or sulfonated water at 150 psig containing low ppm levels of either chemical.\nAll the vessels, valves, pipe, fitting, instruments, etc are specifically designed for either chlorine or sulfur dioxide service.\nThere is a dual sensor chlorine monitor in both the chlorine scale feed room and evaporator control room.  These detect the pressure of chlorine plus alarm locally and in the separate plant operation control room with a light and audible alarm.\nThere is a dual sensor sulfur dioxide monitor in both the sulfur dioxide scale feed room and evaporator control room.  These detect the pressure of sulfur dioxide plus alarm locally and in the sep"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Plant #1 has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a). \n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the City of Atlantic Beach Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response \u00c2\u00bfdecision tree\u00c2\u00bf and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Jacksonville Fire Department, which coordinates with Local Duval County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat Team and with the Mayport Naval Station HazMat Team, all located in Duval County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in Atlantic Beach.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Plant # 1.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to either chlorine or sulfur dioxide spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorination/dechlorination-area operators.  The primary response team include the Jacksonville fire rescue, and HazMat Team.  All of these respond to severe chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  Both a Chlorine and sulfur dioxide \u00c2\u00bfB\u00c2\u00bf Kit is maintained on site to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the Cit"

The City of Atlantic Beach fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system operations including participation in:\n\u00c2\u00bfPSM/RMP safety teams, \n\u00c2\u00bfDevelopment of the operation procedures, \n\u00c2\u00bfHazard evaluations, and \n\u00c2\u00bfOn-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\n1.7. CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY  (g)\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the May 2009, internal safety HazOp, tour, and audit of the PSM program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  An Audit was conducted in March 2007 to review the PSM program.  The key safety action items were completed. \nThe City of Atlantic Beach continually reviews implemented and potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of Atlantic Beach management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide."
