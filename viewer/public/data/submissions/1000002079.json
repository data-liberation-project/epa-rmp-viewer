              "Description": "3. PREVENTION PROGRAM 3, SUBPART D\nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide System of Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 is subject to comply with Prevention Program 3.  This is based on the worst case release scenario analysis results and the System being subject to OSHAA?s PSM rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and it is in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program requirements.  This section describes the EPA and OSHA requirements the City of Atlantic Beach is fulfilling as operator of the Atlantic Beach Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1. The plan also includes the prevention steps taken beyond this regulatory requirement.  The City of Atlantic BeachA?s Document Management System (DMS) contains in it the key OSHA document which details the operation of the prevention program.\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA PSM program and EPA RMP Level 3 prevention program (described above in section 1.1.2).  The plant has an emergency response program, which is coordinated (reviewed by) with the City of Jacksonville Fire Department, which is a member of Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response A?decision treeA? and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.  To ensure the publicA?s safety evacuation may be required during a major release.  Evacuation will begin with a minimum of 1.3 mile radius from the source.  The incident commander is advised to evacuate up to 4 miles radius based on the circumstances of the catastrophic release.  This is three times the distance recommended by the EPA Guidance.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach plant by the following:\nA?High level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system operations including participation in:  \n*safety committee \n*chlorine and sulfur dioxide PSM/RMP safety teams, \n*development of the operation procedures, \n*hazard evaluations, and \n*on-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\nA?Preventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs ensure the safe operation of the equipment and systems.\nA?Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment that meets and/or exceeds industry and regulatory standards. \nA?Use of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.  These documents are all controlled by City of Atlantic Beach DMS document control system.\nA?Management of all changes to the procedures, equipment and chemicals used by the City of Atlantic Beach on the site.  Again, the DMS document control system is key to the high quality of the operation and its products.\nA?Performance of a hazard review of equipment, plant, and procedures\nA?Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include:  1). the chlorine and sulfur dioxide building ventilation system, 2). chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors, 3). Use of full face chlorine and sulfur dioxide canister respirator worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide supply, 4). the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, 5). employee training in operations and maintenance with emphasis on awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, 6). Participation of the Jacksonville Fire Chief in site safety evaluations.\nThe City of Atlantic Beach has in use policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program level 3 listed 12 elements, plus RMP elements needed to implement the program, and similar elements in place in the plantA?s OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in the City of Atlantic Beach DMS document control system under the Key Document listed below:\nElement Title    EPA 68 #    OSHA 1910-119 #\nA?Management System    15    (a&e)\nA?Process safety information    65    ( d )\nA?Process hazard analysis    67    ( e )\nA?Operating procedures    69    ( f )\nA?Training    71    ( g )\nA?Mechanical integrity    73    ( j )\nA?Management of change    75    ( l )\nA?Pre-startup review    77    ( i )\nA?Compliance audits    79    ( o )\nA?Incident investigation    81    ( m )\nA?Employee participation    83    ( c )\nA?Hot work permit    85    ( k )\nA?Contractors    87    ( h )\nA?Emergency Response    95    (n)\nA?Trade Secrets    N/A    ( p )\nThe OSHA PSM elements which are like the RMP elements (above) of the response plan have been in place.  The program is tailored to the City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Plant #1 and to the emergency response services available in the Atlantic Beach, Florida community.  Finally, the plant is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n",

Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used as part of the treatment process. \n1.2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach.  The site is located at 1100 Sandpiper Lane, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  The site is boarded by Sandpiper Lane on the east, Jordan Road on the north, Jordan Street on the west and Levy Road on the south.\nThe Plant includes a chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two regulated substances on site which exceed the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine and dechlorination processes were installed as part of the process of treating wastewater to make it meet strict FDEP discharge permit requirements.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.

It is a dechlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 5 ppm OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Sulfur dioxide is not a carcinogen.\n1.3. WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted for each regulated substances which include two chlorine and two sulfur dioxide release scenarios.  The first is a A?worst case releaseA?.  The second is a more probable A?alternative release scenarioA?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that A?the &#61628; shall assume that the &#61628; maximum quantity in the largest vessel &#61628; is released as a gas over 10 minutesA? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarioA?.\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine and sulfur dioxide released before its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpoint.A?  The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individualA?s ability to take protective action.A?

The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at __ people.\n1.3.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nThe alternative release scenario for each regulated substance involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the EPA wastewater guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine or sulfur dioxide release is 20.0lbs/min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is ____miles.  The residential population potentially that would be impacted by this release is ___.\n1.4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on OSHAA?s PSM program and EPAA?s RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 site program.  The second is the chlorine and sulfur dioxide-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire Department.\n1.4.1. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below:\nA?The City of Atlantic Beach has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nA?The DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \nA?Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardo"

Equipment Design\nThe chlorination systems and like sulfur dioxide system design has four distinct zones or types of pipe design or specification for chlorine is:\nA?High pressure liquid chlorine\nA?High pressure vapor chlorine\nA?Vacuum pressure vapor chlorine\nA?Chlorinated water liquid system.\nThe pipe design for sulfur dioxide is: \nA?High pressure liquid S02\nA?High pressure vapor S02\nA?Vacuum pressure vapor S02\nA?Sulfonated water liquid system.\nBoth the high pressure liquid and vapor systems are designed to three times the normal high pressure of the DOT shipment container.  Materials are primarily of steel construction or like materials, which are compatible with (corrosive resistant to) anhydrous chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\nThe vacuum system is designed to operate at 13 inches of water vacuum pressure (less than atmospheric pressure).  The piping and fittings are made of chemical resistant PVC, glass or like materials.  The system is designated to 150 psig pressure or complete vacuum.\nBoth water systems are made of steel and PVC pipe, and like compatible materials.  The system is designed for chlorinated or sulfonated water at 150 psig containing low ppm levels of either chemical.\nAll the vessels, valves, pipe, fitting, instruments, etc are specifically designed for either chlorine or sulfur dioxide service.\nThere is a dual sensor chlorine monitor in both the chlorine scale feed room and evaporator control room.  These detect the pressure of chlorine plus alarm locally and in the separate plant operation control room with a light and audible alarm.\nThere is a dual sensor sulfur dioxide monitor in both the sulfur dioxide scale feed room and evaporator control room.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Plant #1 has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a). \n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the City of Atlantic Beach Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan includes an emergency response A?decision treeA? and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Jacksonville Fire Department, which coordinates with Local Duval County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat Team and with the Mayport Naval Station HazMat Team, all located in Duval County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in Atlantic Beach.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach Wastewater Plant # 1.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to either chlorine or sulfur dioxide spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorination/dechlorination-area operators.  The primary response team include the Jacksonville fire rescue, and HazMat Team.  All of these respond to severe chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  Both a Chlorine and sulfur dioxide A?BA? Kit is maintained on site to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the Cit"
