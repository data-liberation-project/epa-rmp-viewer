Entergy is focused on providing best-in-class energy service with a focus on safety, teamwork, always learning, integrity, and respect.\nEntergy is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it operates.  Entergy\u0092s safety culture extends throughout the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program for the Entergy site.  As part of the safety culture,  Entergy affirms to employees, customers, and the community to conduct business with respect and care for the environment.  The safety, health, and environmental impact of any proposed modification at any Entergy site will be assessed to ensure that the site continues to operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  In addition, all Entergy sites will be prepared for emergencies to ensure that in the unlikely event of an accidental release, employees and visitors at the site as well as the surrounding community are unharmed and the environment is protected.  \n\n1.2\tDescription of the Montgomery County Power Station Site, Site Processes, and Prioritization of EHS\n1.2.1 Description of the Physical Site\nThe Montgomery County Power Station Site is located at 11177 Longstreet Rd in Willis, Texas within Montgomery County. The Montgomery County Power Station  site is comprised of generally level terrain and is surrounded by dense forests. \nHighway access to the Montgomery County Power Station site is convenient over national highways, state routes and county roads.  Access to this site will be from Texas Interstate Highway 45 and Longstreet Rd. \n\n1.2.2 Description of Site Processes and Stationary Source\nThis site is an electrical power generating facility that utilizes aqueo"

      "SummaryText": "us ammonia at 29.5% solution in water. The aqueous ammonia is stored in a vessel onsite. EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule lists the threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia at 20% concentration or greater to be 20,000 lbs. The aqueous ammonia vessel could store a maximum of 239,750 lbs. OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard specifies a threshold quantity for ammonia solutions greater than 44% by weight. Therefore, the facility is covered by the RMP Rule, and not covered by the PSM standard.\n\n\nThe characteristics and hazards of methane are described in the following section (Section 1.2.3).\n1.2.3 Characteristics and Hazards of Ammonia and Safeguards Applied\n\nAqueous ammonia is a colorless alkaline liquid with a pungent odor. Although generally considered a weak base, aqueous ammonia reacts violently with most acids. It forms explosive compounds with mercury, silver oxide, and other compounds of silver. It corrodes many metals. With the halogens, it forms the shock-sensitive, explosive nitrogen trihalides. With household bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution) it forms toxic and explosively unstable chloramines. The concentration of ammonia in the air above solutions of aqueous ammonia can be within the explosive limits for ammonia (15\u009628%). \nAqueous ammonia is considered toxic to humans. Aqueous ammonia can cause severe skin burns and eye damage. Ammonia vapor may displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation. Inhalation of ammonia vapor may cause respiratory irritation. \nTo reduce the risk of ammonia leaks at the Montgomery County Power Station site, a comprehensive safety strategy has been implemented. This strategy encompasses inherently safe design principles, pressure relief systems, administrative safeguards, and thorough operator training. These measures are essential in maintaining safety and preventing ammonia-related incidents.\n\n1.2.4 Worst Case Scenario\nTo perform the offsite consequence analysis for the Montgomery County Power Station site, EPA\u0092s"

      "SummaryText": "wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) guidance was used to calculate the distance to an endpoint for the worst-case scenario (WCS). MARPLOT was used to overlay the impact area on a map and estimate the population impacted within the endpoints of the WCS. \nThe MARPLOT version 5.1.1 was used to produce the impact area overlays and estimate the population impacted, which uses 2010 census data. Satellite imagery of area from 2023 was reviewed and it was determined that no additional residential developments were within the WCS impact area. \nThe WCS impact area was determined to be 0.2 miles. Within 0.2 miles, MARPLOT indicated that there was one housing unit and population of two impacted. However, upon detailed review of the WCS impact area, no sensitive receptors were found. Therefore, no impacted populations were reported for the RMP submission. \n1.2.5 Program 1 Determination\nPer 40 CFR \u00a7 68.10 (g), the 29% Aqua Ammonia process at the Montgomery County Power Station site is eligible for Program 1 requirements as provided in \u00a7 68.12(b) as it meets all of the following requirements:\n(1)\tFor the five years prior to the submission of this RMP, the process has not had an accidental release of 29% aqua ammonia\n(2)\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release assessment conducted under subpart B and \u00a7 68.25 is less than the distance to any public receptor, as defined in \u00a7 68.3; and \n(3)\tEmergency response procedures have been coordinated between the Montgomery County Power Station facility and the local emergency planning and response organizations."
