The Facility utilizes chlorine to disinfect the final effluent prior to its discharge to the Caney River. \n\nThe Chickasaw Wastewater Treatment Plant views Safety as its principle priority, especially as it pertains to chlorine. The maximum on-site chlorine inventory is 3 tons (6,000 lbs.) and the Facility limits the number of in-service cylinder connections to two (4,000 lbs.). Administrative controls dictate that only one chlorine cylinder valve and its respective distribution header-piping valve are to be open at any time.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for the Chickasaw Wastewater Plant would be release from a one ton (2,000) chlorine cylinder resulting in an estimated Level of Concern [LOC] of 1.2 miles using the National Safety Council's ALOHA mapping program. \n\nThe alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] connection between the cylinder and the distribution header pipe. This has an estimated LOC of 0.99 miles and a release of approximately 1,100 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. \n\nThe second alternate scenario is a release representative of a culmination of both of the two previously cited scenarios. This could only occur if one of the cylinders ruptured and enabled the contents of the second to back flow along the distribution header pipe and exit from the ruptured transfer hose [whip] due to a failure of administrative controls. This would result in a release of approximately 1.5 tons (3,000 lbs.) of chlorine and result in a LOC footprint of 1.4 miles.\n\nThe Chickasaw Wastewater Plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance regimen to minimize the likelihood of a chlorine release at the Facility. Due to the rigid implementation of the above-mentioned programs, this"

Regardless of how slight, were an accident to occur, the Local Emergency Planning Commission [LEPC] and the Bartlesville Fire Department would respond immediately following notification.  \n\nThe Chickasaw Wastewater Plant has no current plans to alter or replace the existing chlorine feed system in the foreseeable future.\n\n"
