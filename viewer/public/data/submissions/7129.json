If an accidental release should happen, the facility and staff is prepared to work with the local fire department and other govermental agencies, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and enviroment.\n\nThe primary purpose of the storage of anhydrous at this location is for the sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application for the crop production nutrients.\n\nThe off - site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, that are identified as worst case release and alternative release scenario. The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.The alternitive release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failing. In either case the first thing that we would do is immediately activate our emergency action plan and call 911 and protect our employees from any danger and work very close with the responding agencies to provide all the information that would be required to abate this accident.\n\nThere have been no releases of anhydrous in the past five years. Even though the company has not had any releases, we still train our employees in what to do incase of a leak.\n\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordence with OSHA 29CFR 1910.38. We also provide state and local authorities the emergency and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nAnnual training is required of all personnel on the proper handling, transfering, or transporting of anhydrous am"
