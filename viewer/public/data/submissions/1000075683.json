The preparatory efforts consisted of the review of current P&ID's and block flow diagrams, process safety information, and identification of all components. The processes were divided into nodes during the P&ID review.\n\n\n\nThe teams were assembled and PHA training was completed prior to performing the PHA. The purpose of the Process Hazard Analyses and the methods to be used were discussed.  Members of the PHA Teams were selected on the basis of those who might offer the most experience and resources to conduct accurate analyses of the covered processes. Specific job experience was considered when assembling the Teams so that Management, Operations and Safety were adequately represented. PHA's and/or revalidations were conducted the weeks of March 23, 2017 (Propylene) and June 27, 2017 (Acetylene)\n\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThe objectives of the Process Hazard Analyses conducted for the Airgas North Central Propylene and Acetylene processes were to review all hazards of regulated substances, processes and procedures. The teams utilized the HAZOP and What if/checklist techniques to identify opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error that could lead to an accidental release.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nPropylene bulk tank and cylinder storage: Acetylene plant and cylinder storage.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nA catastrophic failure of the propylene bulk tank could lead to the release of all propylene in the bulk tank.  A catastrophic failure of the bulk tank could be caused by impact of a large forklift or truck; or by the combination of a truck pull-away and an engineering control failure. Accidental release amount would be 43,860 pounds of propylene. Concrete blocks have been installed to block traffic from coming into contact with bulk tank. Delivery trucks are equipped with breakaway connect"

The failure could cause a very slow accidental release. The most common propylene cylinder at this facility is what we refer to as a hundred pound cylinder. We fill this cylinder with 99 pounds of propylene.\n\n\n\nRMP: Executive Summary [68.155] \n\n\n\n2.5 Has the owner or operator included a brief description of the following elements in the executive summary of the RMP: [68.155]\n\n\n\n2.5.1 The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source? [68.155(a)]\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 The stationary source and regulated substances handled? [68.155(b)]\n\nPropylene and Acetylene are the regulated substances that are managed at the Airgas North Central fill plant in Ankeny, IA.  Airgas North Central trucks pick up returned (empty)  cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propylene is stored at the stationary source in a large bulk tank.  Propylene is transferred from the propylene bulk tank into propylene cylinders. Acetylene is generated on site from Calcium Carbide and transferred into acetylene cylinders. The full propylene and acetylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas North Central to customers.\n\n\n\n2.5.3 The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps? [68.155(c)]\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safe"

      "SummaryText": "ty and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention processes that are specific to propylene and acetylene and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n2.5.4 The five-year accident history? [68.155(d)]\n\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered processes had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within the past 5 years.  In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 222 for additional information or if applicable, updated information.\n\n\n\n2.5.5 The emergency response program? [68.155(e)]\n\nEmployees of the stationary source will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 2280 and Appendix Tab 3120 for additional information.\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Planned changes to improve safety? [68.155(f)]\n\nImplementation of the RMP processes produced changes that improved safety.  One PHA recommendation for installation of acetylene plant ventilation remains open.  Pending MOC."
