Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc. [DCPC] is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Beaumont facility currently transloads, stores, and process 3 regulated substance, Propane, Butane, and Isopentane (2-Methylbutane). At the facility, these products are stored in bulk storage tanks and offloaded from rail cars into tank trucks and transported to the customer. The maximum inventory represents ~30 railcars of product, and 9 bulk storage tanks assuming the contents may be either propane, butane, isopentane, or some combination of each product.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nDCPC has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58 Standards and API 2510. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nDCPC maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Whatif/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and proces"
