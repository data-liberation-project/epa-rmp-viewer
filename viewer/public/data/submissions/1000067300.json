      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Goodrich Corporation Pueblo facility produces carbon brakes for aircraft.  Carbon textile material is received by the facility and is first cut, and prepared for the brake production process.  The textile is then sent to the furnace deck area where it undergoes carbonization and densification in a series of furnaces.  Next, the densified carbon brake parts are machined to the appropriate configuration.  Finally, the non-wearing surfaces of the brakes are coated with an oxidation inhibitor and mounting hardware is attached.  Some reprocessing of used brakes is also conducted at the facility.  In addition to the direct manufacturing activities, a variety of support operations are involved at the Pueblo facility.  On-site laboratories perform both research and development, and quality assurance/quality control functions. Both routine and non-routine maintenance is also conducted on equipment.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses propane in the brake production process.  The propane storage tank is located outside the southwest corner of the furnace deck building.  The maximum inventory of the storage tank is inclued in the RMP.  The storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII) and contains two safety relief valves.  The propane tank is protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail and concrete filled bollards.  The perimeter of the facility is fenced and access to the site is controlled to prevent tampering.  All areas of the plant are monitored via video surveillance and a guard is present during weekday work hours.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario evaluated for propane at the facility involves the release of the entire tank.  The propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to detonate.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate "

Other assumptions include Atmospheric Stability Class F, an ambient temperature of 77 degrees F, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and 50% relative humidity.  USEPA's RMP*Comp calculated the distance to the endpoint for this worst-case propane release scenario which is included in the RMP submission.\n\n\n\nThe endpoint (EP) is defined as the distance an explosion from an accidental propane release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short term exposures will no longer occur.  For propane, the EP is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  An overpressure below 1 psi is not likely to cause injuries that result from flying glass from shattered windows or falling debris from damaged structures.\n\n\n\nThe population within the estimated worst case impact area for propane is estimated to be 0 people using the 2010 Census data and the Marplot mapping software package.  However, it was determined that there are commercial properties within the endpoint of the worst-case impact radius.  Therefore, because the propane system is also subject to the PSM rule, the propane system is a Program 3.  There are no other public or environmental receptors within the worst case impact radius.\n\n\n\nAlthough a worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP Rule, a worst-case occurrence is a highly unlikely event.  The possibility of a catastrophic failure of the storage tank is extremely remote because:  (1) the storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with industry standards (i.e. ASME and NFPA 58 Codes); (2) the tank is equipped with two safety relief valves to prevent over pressurization and catastrophic release; (3) the perimeter of the facility is fenced and access to the site is controlled to prevent tampering; (4) the propane tank is protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail; and (5) the external surface of the tank is visually inspected on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nAn alternative "

      "SummaryText": "release scenario is also required for Program 3, and is considered \"more likely\" to occur than the worst case scenario, but must still be significant enough to impact off-site areas (i.e., achieve at least the EP at the plant fence line).  The Risk Management Program Guidance For Propane Storage Facilities (\"Propane Guidance\") was used to select a credible alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen represents the incident that is most likely to occur but is still severe enough to achieve the EP at the facility fence line.  This scenario assumes that the tank is overfilled, and one of the safety relief valves lifts to relieve the excess pressure.  The valve is assumed to remain open for five minutes.  The \"Propane Guidance\" was used to estimate the distance to the EP, assuming the same vapor cloud explosion described in the worst case scenario (the released vapor forms a cloud, of which 10 percent ignites).  The distance to the EP (1 psi) is calculated and included in the RMP.  There are no residential populations within this distance.  Also, there are no environmental receptors within this impact radius.\n\n\n\nAlthough an alternative release consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule, a failure and release of propane that is large enough to reach an EP beyond the fence line is not likely because the propane vendor follows a procedure designed to ensure that the filling of the tank is safely accomplished by qualified personnel.  Additionally, the tank is not re-filled until it has reached 30% capacity or less.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases propane at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in injury, death or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility currently follows a formal incident investigation procedure and completes a report to capture any future events that mig"

The key components of the RMP prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n-  The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of the process and the design of the system and equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the covered processes.\n\n-  The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant {i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize covered processes are the most knowledgeable about it and are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n-  The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on covered processes using the checklist and flowchart study methods.  PHAs address:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failures; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  PHAs may result in procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the covered processes, and all recommendations are tracked and resolved.  PHAs will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n-  Written operating procedures (OPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of covered processes.  The OPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences o"

The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to covered processes.\n\n-  Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n-  Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of a regulated substance are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\n-  Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the covered processes are \"pre-qualified\" based on their knowledge of the system, understanding of applicable codes and standards, written safety and training programs, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\n\n-  Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), management must approve the work by executing a written hot work authorization permit to verify that precautions to prevent fire have been implemented.\n\n-  Periodic inspections of the covered processes are used to detect any indication of potential failure that could lead to a release.\n\n-  Utilization of safety systems, including pressure relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and safety interlocks.\n\n-  Proper design, including adherence to recognized safety codes.\n\n-  Planning in accordance with the Pueblo"
