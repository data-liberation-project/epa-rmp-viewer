General accidental release and prevention policy of Performance Food Group.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent human exposure, reduce the threat to our workers personal\nhealth, the surrounding community and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all\napplicable federal and state regulations.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of\nammonia combined with the safety devices that are incorporated in our facility and the safe\nhandling procedures that our personnel are trained in.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nPerformance Food Group, 825 Maddox-Simpson Parkway, Lebanon, Tennessee is responsible for\nthe storage and distribution of various frozen food products.  There are approximately 120\nemployees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  This distribution facility\nreceives and prepares shipment of frozen food via tractor trailers approximately 20 hours a day,\nseven days a week.  \n\nPerformance Food Group is located in an industrial park approximately 3 miles north east of the\ncity of Gainesville, Florida.  In addition to our distribution facility the industrial park also houses\nother manufacturing or business facilities.  \n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the Performance Food Group facility is\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  The dominant characteristic of ammonia vapor is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not result in any health risks. \nRis"
