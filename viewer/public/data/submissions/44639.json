Root cause cited in the report was the contractor failed to follow line and flange breaking procedures and failure to follow the JSA. Corrective action included reviewing the lockout/tagout and line and flange breaking procedures to ensure they were well understood. The Contractor PSM Safety Orientation material was edited to inform contractors of the potential risk of residual chlorine dioxide gas when conducting line breaking and to follow the site line and flange breaking procedures.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAn Emergency Response Team capable of providing multiple emergency response functions is available on the plantsite. The team has regular Haz-Mat, fire fighting, and confined space/high angle rescue training and drills. In addition, the team is trained in CPR, patient packaging and handling and bloodborne pathogens. \n\nIn emergencies, the shift manager is the incident commander who determines the degree of hazard and risk posed to public health and the environment. An internal alert millwide alarm system can be sounded to summon the emergency response team. Procedures for regulatory, emergency management agency, and public notification are documented in the Quality System. Mutual aid requests are made through 911 notification. \n\nContinuous Improvement\nContinuous improvement in our safety and environmental programs is the expectation at CPPC. Near miss and safety incident investigations, root cause analysis and corrective action implementation support continuous improvement. Team members have been trained in conducting risk assessments to further evaluate the jobsite and work procedure risks. Individual safety plans are being developed for each employee on the plant site defining their role and commitment to safe work practices. These improvements a"

The facility's emphasis on accident prevention is demonstrated by having one of the lowest Recordable Injury Rates in the industry, being among the first pulp & paper facilities in the United States to achieve OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star status and through emphasis on continuous improvement in its safety programs. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program has a trained emergency response team with equipment for responding to on-site fires, hazardous material releases, emergency medical response and rescue. The program has a dedicated emergency response coordinator responsible for coordinating the weekly training and development of the emergency response team. Response activities have been discussed with the Lowndes LEPC and county fire departments and LEPC meetings have been conducted at the facility to increase their awareness of the hazards at the plant as well as the resources. \r\n\r\nThe commitment to an \u00bfinjury free\u00bf work environment is supported by a safety management system that includes: \r\n* OSHA Star Voluntary Protection Plan certification\r\n* Plant Safety and Health Guideline Documentation including Safe Work Practices\r\n* Job Safety Analysis\r\n* Sta"

CPPC encourages team members with knowledge and experience working with hazardous chemicals to participate in the PHA task team effort. The PHA findings are shared with employees working with hazardous chemicals. Employees are advised of any necessary changes brought about by the PHA and, in some cases, may be involved in the design change and implementation process. \r\n\r\n* Operating Procedures: \r\nCPPC process engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed. Employees participate in operating procedure development in several ways: \r\n1. Employees are consulted during procedure development and implementation to determine if the procedures accurately reflect what is practiced in the field and what additional measures should be added to increase worker safety and protect the environment.\r\n2. Development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are assigned to employees that have recognized knowledge, experience and job skills related to the assigned procedure. \r\n3.

Employees record equipment history, data and observations, maintain the SAP maintenance system database, and generate Reliability Maintenance system reports. The employee doing the actual test and inspection work is typically asked to review and comment about manufacturers recommendations for preventive maintenance procedures and test frequencies. Employees take part in equipment failure reviews, participate in work process critiques, and are encouraged to make recommendations for change. \r\n\r\n* Management of change: \r\nThe CPPC management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind are approved without completing the full management of change process. Changes other than \u00bflike kind\u00bf must be approved through the management of change process to ensure that potential accidents resulting from change are prevented, safety concerns of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.  \r\n\r\n* Pre-startup Review: \r\nCPPC performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.

In these audits, adherence to both Corporate and mill policies, internal procedures and standards are made. Team members will be interviewed as part of audit protocols to permit them to give input on the specific issues being audited.

As is standard practice for chlorine dioxide planned maintenance outages, the piping had been thoroughly flushed with process water prior to beginning the scheduled maintenance work. As the contractor loosened the bolts around 11:00 AM, some residual chlorine dioxide gas trapped in the line was released. The contractor immediately retightened the bolts to stop the leakage and evacuated the area. \r\n\r\nThe contractor believed his exposure was"

Root cause cited in the report was the contractor failed to follow line and flange breaking procedures and failure to follow the JSA. Corrective action included reviewing the lockout/tagout and line and flange breaking procedures to ensure they were well understood. The Contractor PSM Safety Orientation material was edited to inform contractors of the potential risk of residual chlorine dioxide gas when conducting line breaking and to follow the site line and flange breaking procedures.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Response Team capable of providing multiple emergency response functions is available on the plantsite. The team has regular Haz-Mat, fire fighting, and confined space/high angle rescue training and drills. In addition, the team is trained in CPR, patient packaging and handling and bloodborne pathogens. \r\n\r\nIn emergencies, the shift manager is the incident commander who determines the degree of hazard and risk posed to public health and the environment. An internal alert millwide alarm system can be sounded to summon the emergency response team. Procedures for regulatory, emergency management agency, and public notification are documented in the Quality System. Mutual aid requests are made through 911 notification. \r\n\r\nContinuous Improvement\r\nContinuous improvement in our safety and environmental programs is the expectation at CPPC.
