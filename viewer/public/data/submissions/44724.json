All applicable procedures of the EPA Prevention Program are adhered to. The Planters Ginning Company emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. It is also in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Planters Ginning Company facility in Brawley stores anhydrous ammonia for sale as a fertilzer. Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored at the facility. The facility holds 126,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two tanks. The tanks hold approximately 14,000 and 20,000 gallons, respectively. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for this process, identified as \u00bfworst case release scenario\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release scenario.\u00bf The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\u00bf due to an unspecified failure. The alternative release scenario is on that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the toxic substance released before its concentration decreases to the EPA toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L for anhydrous ammonia), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without which could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00bf  The residential population within a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint"

      "SummaryText": "distance has to be defined, \u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected.\u00bf\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for these scenarios (worst case and alternate release) was performed for two sets of conditions. The first set followed conditions pre-defined by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n\u00bf\tOnly the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of a release point is potentially affected. This plume, or footprint, is approximately 6% (one-twentieth) of the area of the full circle.\n\n\u00bf\tIt is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one hour average standard. The one hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten minute release time.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to a toxic endpoint of 4.4 miles and an estimate of residential and commercial population potentially affected of 2,074 were obtained for an ammonia release. The typical meteorological conditions used for this scenario was a Stability Class F, wind speed 1.5 m/s, average air temperature, and average humidity. \n\nThe alternative release scenarios involved the rupture of a tank or line possibly due to vehicular damage or vandalism. The amount of ammonia released was predicted to be 1,373.3 lbs/min and the toxic endpoint distance from ERPG-2 was .57 miles. The toxic concentration levels outside this endpoint distance are below the allowable standards for toxic substances established by AIHA. The typical meteorological conditions used for this scenario was a Stability Class D, wind"

Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted once every year; emergency operations and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
