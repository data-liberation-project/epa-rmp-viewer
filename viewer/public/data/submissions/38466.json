This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release preevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releasess of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Rock Island Emergency & Disaster which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release."
