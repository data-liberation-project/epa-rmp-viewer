Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nNorth East Florida Chemical  Corporation (also NEFL) stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  NEFL has Emergency Response Procedures in the office, which include procedures for reporting hazardous chemical accidents or releases and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  NEFL also has its Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as Emergency Escape Mask  Procedures, which detail how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.   \n\nNEFL's Emergency Action Plan is contained within section N of the OSHA PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available safety goggles, gloves and escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A verbal notification system is in place to alert personnel about chlorine leaks.  A posted Emergency Response Telephone list identifies who to call in the event of a release, which includes calling 911.\n\n2.

The facility operates five days a week (M-F), and approximately eight hours per day, and 50 weeks per year.\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\nThe Fill Yard is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the chlorine storage area.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations.\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months,  are the busiest swim times of the year and the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. NEFL stores a maximum of 14400 pounds of chlorine, which exceeds the 2500lb Federal threshhold.  This amount includes the contents of 6 one-ton containers, 120 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process.\n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 6, are stored and/or used in the Fill Yard.\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist, cherry picker or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on the rails in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.

The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 14400 pounds.\n\nChlorine is repackaged from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine is directed into a liquid caustic absorption tank.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT aproved cylinders, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption system.\n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to the lower (liquid level) valve on the operational one-ton container and an empty service cylinder is brought into place on a pan scale and attached to the other end of the transfer assembly.  Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.
