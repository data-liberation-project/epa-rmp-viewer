Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nCobra's Oil and Gas Corporation's (Cobra) South Buckeye 127 Central Production Facility (CPF) is making a commitment to worker and public safety, and to the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, and operation and maintenance of the process equipment. Cobra's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nII. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe South Buckeye 127 CPF, locate near Beaverton, Gladwin County, Michigan, operates as an unmanned facility with processes to remove liquids from sweet natural gas. The plant has a single regulated flammable mixture, which contains methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. The plant does not have any regulated toxic substances. The South Buckeye 127 CPF is a Program 2 Level facility.\n\n\n\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBecause South Buckeye 127 CPF is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68) for a Program Level-2 facility, this summary addresses the RMP elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program. \n\n\n\n- Safety Information: The South Buckeye 127 CPF keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process.   These documents address hazards associated with the hazardous chemicals at the facility, the process technology, and process equipment.\n\n\n\n- Hazard Review: Within the program, the process is systematically examined as necessary to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\n- Operating Procedures: The South Buckeye 127 CPF has written operating procedures, implemented those procedures, and properly trained al"

The South Buckeye 127 CPF uses skilled personnel that have appropriate training to assure the work they are doing is completed correctly and in a manner that safeguards the property and safety of the company, personnel, and the general public.\n\n\n\n- Training: To complement the written procedures for process operations, the South Buckeye 127 CPF has implemented and has recently updated a comprehensive and effective training program for all employees involved in operating the process. The program is intended to help employees understand the nature and problems arising from process operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards particular to a process.\n\n\n\n- Maintenance: The South Buckeye 127 CPF has written maintenance procedures, which have been implemented and all appropriate employees have received proper training.\n\n\n\n- Compliance Audits: No compliance audits have been conducted for the South Buckeye 127 CPF, but will be completed every 3 years, with the first due March 2016. In addition, the facilities management team ensures that day-to-day operations, maintenance, and administrative activities are performed consistent with the intended RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- Incident Investigation: The South Buckeye 127 CPF has had no incidents. However, an Incident Investigation procedure is in place in the event it will need to be used.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the South Buckeye 127 CPF have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The South Buckeye 127 CPF has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The South Buckeye 127 CPF uses release detection systems such as gas detectors, and release mitigation measures such as dikes to contain liquid releases.\n\n\n\nIV. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe South Buckeye 127 CPF has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substanc"

Emergency Response Information:\n\nThe South Buckeye 127 CPF is not required to have an emergency response program because employees will not respond to releases. The facility has coordinated with the Gladwin Fire Department to respond safely to releases. However, the facility has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of elements such as: communication procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, response to a fire or explosion, severe weather response, environmental spill response, or pipe line failure. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modifications made to the facility process or operating procedures, or changes in the communication procedures.\n\n\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe South Buckeye 127 CPF will conduct hazard reviews, safety audits, and incident investigations as applicable to continuously improve the worker and public safety.\n\n"
