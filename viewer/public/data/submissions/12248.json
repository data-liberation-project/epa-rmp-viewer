Maximum inventory is 4,000 lbs.  No chlorine is on site between the period of November 15 and April 15.  A chlorine gas detector is installed and designed to alarm the Fire/Rescue District upon activation.  The Fire/Rescue District has assumed all responsbility for emergency response.  Facility operators are trained in the care and safe handling of chlorine in addition to the hazards it poses to the public.  Equipment maintenance is performed in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.  There has been no accident history, pertaining to the storage and handling of chlorine, for at least the past five years.  Within the next two years, a sodium hypochlorite system is planned to be installed at this facility and if completed, chlorine gas will no longer be used at this site.\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR PROGRAM LEVEL 2 PROCESSES:\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSIGNATURE (name):  Jeff Van Landuyt\nTITLE:  Wastewater Treatment Superintendent, City of Woodstock            DATE: June 18, 1999"
