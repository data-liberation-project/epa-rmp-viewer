All applicable procedures of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response action plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the State and Federal Emergency Response Program requirements.                               \r\n\r\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Valley Generating Station (VGS) is a 150-acre electric power generating facility designed to generate and supply electric power to the LADWP's system. The facility has combined cycle generating facility (CCGF) that includes two combustion gas turbines (CTs), a steam turbine generator, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) and associated selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, cooling towers and ancillary equipment. CCGF is fired by natural gas with the capability to fire with distillate fuel under emergency conditions. CCGF covers approximately 10 acres of land at VGS. The total Station gross capacity will be 583 MW.  \r\n\r\nThe Station is manned and operated at all times, with a minimum operating crew consisting of 2 operators and a supervisor. Valley GS was constructed in approximately 1951. Valley GS has a gate that is manned with a security guard 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located in Sun Valley, California. The area surrounding the facility is primarily commercial/light industrial; however, a day time emergency clinic, a hospital, and two motels are present on San Fernando Road. A sand and gravel plant is located adjacent to the northwest of"

The nearest residential properties are located approximately one-half mile to the north of the facility.\r\n\r\nAqueous Ammonia Process Description:\r\n\r\nLADWP has selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems that reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from an existing 47-MW combustion turbines and two combustion gas turbines (CTs). The CTs are located at the new combined cycle generating facility (CCGF). The existing SCR for the 47-MW combustion turbine utilizes aqueous ammonia stored in a steel aboveground storage tank (AST). The CCGF utilizes two additional aqueous ammonia ASTs. The storage tanks are all located within secondary containment areas equipped with a sump and pump for pumping out rainwater. The containment areas are designed to hold the contents of the largest tank as well as account for a 25-year flood scenario.\r\n\r\nAqueous Ammonia Handling and Storage\r\n\r\nThe Ammonia Handling and Storage system supplies ammonia solution to the NOx emission control system. Ammonia solution is used instead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards requiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing. The risks and safety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.\r\n\r\nThere are two storage tanks located near the CCGF and provide aqueous ammonia for the Peaker Plant and the CCGF SCR systems. The product tanks are located within secondary containment areas (concrete dike) with sumps. Two positive displacement pumps, each fully redundant, dispense ammonia solution from the ASTs to the emission control equipment. Other safety equipment associated with the tanks are: pressure/vacuum relief valves, temperature and pressure indicators, pressure and liquid level alarms, an ammonia vapor scrubber, cam-lock fill connections, vapor recovery and associated piping, strategicall"

The truck parks within a concrete area that is provided with a collection sump to contain spills from the delivery truck. The ammonia solution unloading to the storage tank is done through a quick fill connection. A truck-mounted vapor recovery system is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading. The storage tanks are equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tanks are maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe storage tank redundant dispensing pump is placed into service when the main pump fails or is out of service for preventive maintenance. The loading operator is provided with a readily accessible water supply to wash spills quickly. All spills are collected and disposed of in accordance with federal, state and local waste disposal requirements. Flashing lights and audible alarms at the tanks and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 25 parts per million in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe OCA is conducted in accordance with the latest RMP OCA guidance document that has been developed by the USEPA in conjunction with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The estimated toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case release scenario potentially affects some public receptors.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the spill of the ammonia solution as a result of the rupture of a two-inch diameter, 100 feet long flexible transfer hose during the bulk transferring of the solution from a tanker truck to the storage tanks. The transfer pump is manually shut off within 15 seconds after the hose rupture.  The volume of released solution spills onto the paved ground that slopes into a bermed area.  The regulatory default meteorological conditions used were: wind stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, and a release temperature of 114F (maximum daily temperature at the nearest monitoring station), 50% average humidity, and urban surroundings.
