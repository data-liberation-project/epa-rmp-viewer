      "SummaryText": "Samson Resources Company operates the Rockymount Gas Plant in Bossier Parish, LA. The facilty is located in Sec. 33 - 23N - 12W approximately 12 miles southeast of Plain Dealing, LA.\nTransfer lines from 5 wells deliver a mixture of oil, gas, and water to this location. The mixture is compressed to a pressure of approximately 450 psi and directed through a series of seperation equipment to extract the produced water, condensate, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Produced water and condensate are routed to atmospheric stock tanks and stored on location. On an as needed basis, the fluids are removed from location via tanker trucks. The NGL (essentially propane) is routed and stored on site in a pressrized 18,000 gal horizontal tank until sold and removed from site.\nA worst-case release analysis was modeled using the RMP Comp Ver 1.07. The result of the modeling was a vapor cloud explosion with an enpoint of 1,584 feet.  There are no residential, public, or environmental receptors within the model's estimated endpoint.\nThe Rocky Mount Gas Plant has had no accidents that have caused on-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\nThe results of the foregoing analysis indicate that the facility has a low potential to cause serious harm to the public or the environment. Therefore, a Program Level 1 Risk Management Plan is required."
