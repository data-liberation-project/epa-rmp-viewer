      "SummaryText": "DeBruce Ag. Service, Inc in Dearborn, Missouri is an agricultural retailer of fertilizers and crop protection products to farmers in an 20 mile radius of Dearborn. We maintain two anhydrous ammonia storage vessels that are connected. These storage vessels are 18,000 and 12,000 gallons each. Our storage units each contain the internal excess flow valves that provide positive shut-off of product flow in the event of a hose or pipe failure. We have identified the worst case scenerio to produce a release of 7,150 lbs of anhydrous ammonia at a potential distance of 3.1 miles from the storage tanks.This would exist under adverse weather conditions such as hanging clouds, high humidity and wind. DeBruce Ag Service works in cooperation with the local LEPC to respond to any accidental releases of product from our storage vessels. Internally, Debruce Ag. Is pro-active in identifying work hazards, and communicating those hazards to our employees, through regular safety meetings. DeBruce Ag Service believes that all level of employees are responsible for health and safety of thos employed by Debruce Companies as well as the community in which it operates."
