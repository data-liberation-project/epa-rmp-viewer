To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods FOREST, MS., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods FOREST, MS., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans 29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n      Poultry slaughter plant, further processing etc. \n      Regulated substance: 63,000LBS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA USED AS A REFRIGERANT\n\n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 8,000) pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 8,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1 MILE before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario  - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazar"

Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had 1 releases in the past 5 years of this type.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n    Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  For chlorine systems Tyson Foods Inc. has adopted the Chlorine Institute guidelines for chlorine use. \n \n5.  Five-year accident history.\n     ON 8/4/98 WE HAD A 20 MINUTE RELEASE RESULTING IN A 475LB. AMMONIA LOSS CAUSING TWO\n     MINOR INJURIES AND NO PROPERTY DAMAGE. THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE HUMAN \n     ERROR COUPLED WITH EQPT. FAILURE. AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT THE PROCEDURES AND\n     TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE REVISED.\n\n6.   The emergency response program.    \nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies, Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions "
