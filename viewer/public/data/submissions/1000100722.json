This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving both practices and measures to prevent the release of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, the Cimarron facility is prepared to work with the Gray County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information\r\nThe Cimarron facility's primary covered process activity is the storage of fertilizers.  This activity includes processing of anhydrous ammonia by a third-party company called Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor owned and operated by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The emergency procedures for Cimarron are coordinated with the Gray County LEPC.\r\n\r\nWinField United - Cimarron, KS has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The only process that this RMP includes is the storage of anhydrous ammonia. The T-reactor process is done entirely by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC; and their process is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  \r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  A robust inspection program has been implemented and the elements of the prevention program are tracked using an electronic EHS management system.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History."
