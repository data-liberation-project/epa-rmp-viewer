Who is Photofabrication Engineering Inc.?\n\nPhotofabrication Engineering Inc. (PEI) was founded in 1967 to provide the electronics and related industries with high precision chemically machined parts.  Shortly after the company's establishment, we began branching into the decorative markets.  Our products can be found in the electronics, medical, appliance, automotive, and aerospace industries.  Our decorative products offer exquisite and intricate design and fabrication in the area of jewelry findings, holiday ornaments, commemoratives, museum pieces, and architectural model components.  \n\nWe have been located at 500 Fortune Boulevard, Milford, MA since 1984.  We employ 42 people from Milford and the surrounding communities.  Since we commenced operations in Milford, we have been very active in supporting community activities such as the Salvation Army, Make One Wish charity, Milford Legion Baseball, and the United Way.  \n\nB.   What is the Risk Management Program?\n\nIn 1996, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated regulations for the response, prevention, and detection of accidental releases of 77 toxic substances and 63 flammable substances.  The regulation, called \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions,\" is found at 40 CFR 68 and meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990's Section 112r.  The purpose of these Risk Management Programs is to prevent accidental releases where possible, minimize the impacts of accidental releases on the general population and the environment, and to educate the public on the potential impacts of an accidental release.  \n\nA facility is subject to these regulations if it handles, stores, uses, or manufactures more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a \"process.\"  An applicable facility must prepare a Risk Management Plan that includes a hazard ass"

      "SummaryText": "essment, accident prevention program, and emergency response program, and is required to submit the Risk Management Plan to EPA by June 21, 1999. \n\nC.   How is PEI Subject to RMP?\n\nChlorine gas is used in one of our processes.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is liquefied under pressure.  Chlorine is included on EPA's list of chemicals subject to RMP and has a threshold of 2,500 pounds.  We store a maximum of four (4) one-ton steel cylinders of chlorine gas inside our building, under lock and key.  The total amount of chlorine stored for this process exceeds the RMP threshold.  No other chemical at PEI exceeds the RMP thresholds of applicability.  Following EPA's guidance, we determined that we are subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulations.  \n\nOur metal etching process uses an etchant that can be regenerated and reused over and over, 50 or more times.  One of the benefits of regenerating the etchant is that the amount of waste generated from the process is significantly reduced.  It is this regeneration process that utilizes chlorine gas.  \n\nII.  PEI'S RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nPEI's Risk Management Plan, of which this Executive Summary is a part, complies with the specific requirements in EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) for Program 3 processes.   \n\nA.   Understanding PEI's Approach to Chemical Safety\n\nWe understand that our use of chlorine requires proper storage and handling precautions to prevent exposures of our co-workers, neighbors, and the environment in the day-to-day use of chlorine and in event of an accidental release.  Furthermore, it is our goal to meet or exceed, where possible, all state and Federal requirements regarding protection of the environment.  As such, the management at PEI has implemented numerous measures to prevent, mitigate, and respond to accidental releases of chlorine at the facility.  \n\nManaging the risks and hazards associated with chorine begins with the employees.  It is our policy that only trained and experienced chlorine handlers"

      "SummaryText": "operate the chlorine cylinders and the associated equipment.  All employees are encouraged to make recommendations to further ensure safe handling of chlorine.  \n\nThe regeneration process, process equipment, and materials of construction comply with the guidelines in The Chlorine Institute's \"Chlorine Manual,\" including: \n\n\u00bf heavy-walled steel cylinders\n\u00bf a fire suppression system in the event of a fire\n\u00bf an emergency repair kit (Emergency Kit \u00bfB\u00bf)\n\u00bf safety relief valves\n\u00bf triple valving to allow isolation of leaks\n\u00bf regular inspections and maintenance of process equipment.  \n\nAnother key aspect of our prevention program is compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  PSM includes a Hazard Analysis that identifies problems that may lead to a release and/or exposure to chlorine and rectifies the problem.  PSM also evaluates training, maintenance, management of change, and inspection activities related to proper use, storage, and handling of chlorine.  The PSM program is updated regularly.\n\nOur chlorine handling policies also include that the chlorine is turned off at the cylinder when not in use and only two one-ton cylinders are connected to the process at any time.  The cylinders that are not connected to the process (i.e., in storage) are very unlikely to be involved in an accidental release when considering the strong steel structure of the cylinders and the preventative measures put in place.\n\nC.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nAs further evidence of our rigorous chlorine management programs, PEI has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine to date.  Nevertheless, we will continue to improve our chlorine, use, storage, and handling efforts in the future.\n\nD.   Emergency Response Program - Just in Case\n\nIn spite of the fact that we have never had a chlorine release, PEI has prepared a \"Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\" to ensure rapid response in the event of an"

The Contingency Plan has been distributed to the Milford Fire Department, Milford Police Department, Milford Board of Health, Milford/Whitinsville Hospital, and 3E Corporation.  In the event of an emergency that may potentially impact the community, the Milford Police Department will notify residents and businesses.\n\nIII.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard assessment includes configuring the appropriate release scenario and predicting the maximum distance to the edge of the impact area (called the \"zone of impact\").  We used guidance from EPA to define the release scenarios for the alternative release and the worst-case release.  PEI used the EPA program RMP Comp to predict the zone of impact for the two scenarios. \n\nThe concentration of chlorine that defines the zone of impact is based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association's (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guidelines.  The endpoint represents a safe level of exposure \"below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.\"  The endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l (3 parts per million) in ambient air. Per changes in EPA requirements (40 CFR 68.155) a summary of the potential release scenarios is not included in the Executive Summary. \n\nIV.  CONCLUSIONS\n\nAt PEI, we understand that our use of chlorine requires proper storage and handling precautions to prevent exposures of our co-workers, neighbors, and the environment in the day-to-day use of chlorine and in event of an accidental release.  It is also our goal to meet or exceed, where possible, all state and Federal requirements regarding protection of the environment.  \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we have provided sufficient documentation to the local emergency"
