      "SummaryText": "\nThe Town of Smithfield operates the Smithfield Water Plant on the Neuse River in Smithfield, NC.  The plant is a conventional rapid sand filter rated at 6 million gallons per day.  The primary disinfectant is Chlorine gas that is stored in 2,000-pound cylinders.  Up to three cylinders may be on site at one time; therefore the Risk Management Plan has been prepared.\n\nThe RMP was prepared by a committee of Town personnel made up of The Utilities Director, The Human Resource Officer, The Water Plant Superintendent, The Chief Operator, The Laboratory Technician and Plant Operators.  The committee met weekly to review and update the Process Safety Management Program, perform Process Hazard Analysis and Hazard Assessments.\n\nThe Town is very serious about its obligation to protect the public and the environment and demonstrates its commitment through employee training, expenditures on safety related equipment, and close coordination with local emergency services.  The Utility Director is a member of the Johnston County Local Emergency Planning Committee which is the agency responsible for emergency response to the Water Plant.\n\nThe Town of Smithfield is very proud of its unblemished safety record and will continue to work hard to maintain it."
