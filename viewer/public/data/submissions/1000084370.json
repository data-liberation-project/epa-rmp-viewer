              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites  local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

Regular inspections and maintenance are required on all storage facilities, loading and unloading facilities, application equipment and portable tanks.  Employees who handle anhydrous ammonia are required to attend bi-annual training which emphasize the properties of anhydrous ammonia, the effects of anhydrous ammonia on the human body, operating procedures, emergency procedures, and emergency first aid.  PPE, including gloves, goggles, hard hats, emergency water, and sturdy work clothes & shoes are required whenever handling anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, LEPC, law enforcement, or other authorities to mitigate the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and kept in storage tanks until distributed to customers in mobile nurse tanks for use as a nitrogen fertilizer.  The storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling the nurse tanks, pumps and controls, lighting and safety equipment are all part of the facilities anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is staffed during seasonal operating hours and is secured when not in operation.  Security includes area lighting, closing and locking the main valve (belly valve) from the storage tank(s), locking out power to pumps, closing fill hose end valves and locking them in a box that prevents unauthorized access to them, locking nurse tank unloading valves, and walk-thru inspections.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., the standards of the U.S. Occupa"
