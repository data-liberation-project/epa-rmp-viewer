Baumert, Assistant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Scribner Grain & Lumber are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accident release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other auhorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\n  - The primary activity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for resale to farmers.\n\n  - Anyhdrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n  - The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi tanker holding 38,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n\n\n.\n\n  A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 300 ppm) is 1.7 miles.\n\n  B.  The alternative release scenario based on the 5-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .41 miles.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administratin (OSHA), 29 CRF 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" (1999 Edition).\n\n\n\nThe five-year Accident His"

A written emergency aaction plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n  b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information.\n\n  C.  An emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including preemergency planning and employee training.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at the time."
