As part of this commitment we have established a system to promote the safe operation at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nThe RMP at this facility consists of three (3) elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand: \nThe potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and \nAccidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the use substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards or controls against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage to its employees, the public and the environment. We limit the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nThe safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. There are other prevention programs that are company specific and those required by the Department of Transportation under parts 192 or 195 and OSHA under the PSM regulation.

This facility implements reasonable prevention programs to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at this facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment. This facility coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response personnel.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThis facility is primarily involved in the storage and wholesale distribution of natural gas liquids.  As part of this process, we handle several regulated, flammable substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. There are no such quantities of regulated toxic substances handled at the terminal. The following RMP-regulated flammables are found at the terminal:\n\nPropane\n\nButane\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility uses a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1994, this prevention program for processing of natural gas was formalized to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention program requirements. Program 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.

The Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary tool used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and company corporate management for resolution. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years.\n\n4. OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThis facility maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. These procedures provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit deviations for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n5. TRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, this facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

CONTRACTORS\n\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\na)\tperform their work in a safe manner\nb)\thave the appropriate knowledge and skills\nc)\tare aware of the hazards in their workplace\nd)\tunderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency\ne)\tunderstand and follow site safety rules\nf)\tinform terminal personnel of any hazards they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Kinder Morgan evaluates contractor safety programs and their past performance before selection of a contractor is made. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n7. PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR is conducted at this facility for any major facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to terminal management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. The final resolution if each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\n\n12. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, this facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years. Both Operations and Corporate staff personnel may participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to terminal management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at this facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. We have safety features on many units"

The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to terminal emergencies. It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service. The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions. Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage. Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacuate the facility and notify the appropriate authorities.\n\nEmployees receive training in these"
