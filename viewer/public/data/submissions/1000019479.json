      "SummaryText": "This facility is subject to the EPA's SPCC regulation (40 CFR 112.7) and the release prevention procedures are discussed in more detail in the facility SPCC plan.  The emergency response procedures are contained at the front of the RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nThis facility is an oil and gas production site.  A JT unit is used to strip out NGL liquids which are stored in a 6,000 gallon and 12,600 gallon pressurized bullet tank.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Separated condensate is stored in two 400 barrel atmospheric storage tanks and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks.  The facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.  The NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  The facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
