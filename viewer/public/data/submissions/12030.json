Although there are several controls to prevent such a release and to manage the consequences (e.g. periodic inspections of storage vessels, remotely-activated valves used to isolate and limit the release, and the release detection system connected to a plant-wide Emergency Alarm System), no credit for mitigation was taken into account in evaluating the scenario.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS will result in off-site impacts of our industrial neighbors. EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Equations were used to determine if the WCS would result in an off-site impact (distance to 1-psi endpoint). \n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS), associated with flammable substances, at HCC is the separation of a 3-inch unloading arm of an isobutane railcar during operation.  The ARS assumes the active and passive safety systems are functional and the Emergency shutdown system isolates the release.

Examples of employee participation range from reviewing process safety information and Standard Operating Procedures to serving on Process Hazard Analysis teams.  \n\nHCC also utilizes other processes such as company communication tools and the Employee Safety Process to keep employee participation evergreen and provide periodic reminders to the employees that their process safety concerns and suggestions are welcome. \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nHCC compiles and maintains written process safety information to enable both the employer and employee the ability to effectively identify and understand the hazards posed by the process.  Written PSI provides employees with a baseline of information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process.  This PSI provides the foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analysis, developing operating procedures, and determining the applicability of management of change. The record copy of this formation is maintained in the HCC Central Office Building Library. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA process hazard analysis is a detailed and systematic evaluation of all aspects of the process (equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures) to identify the potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  PHAs are performed on existing and new units in all of HCC's nine covered processes.  The Checklist and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), or other appropriate equivalent methodologies, were used to perform the PHAs on each covered process at HCC.

HCC is focused on preventing serious process-related incidents that might affect plant personnel, visitors, the community or the environment.  The HCC process safety management (PSM) program demonstrates this focused commitment.  The HCC PSM program involves the application of management systems to control process hazards through programs, procedures, audits, evaluations, and training that considers safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  \n\nAlthough, the management systems for chemical process operations target continuous improvement in the storage, use, and manufacturing of regulated substances, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain a process-related incident in the event one should occur.  The knowledge that is gained from accident/incident reports, maintenance records, case histories, and trend analysis of incidents will provide basic information and changes that can be utilized to help further prevent catastrophic events.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Phillips Chemical Company Houston Chemical Complex (HCC) located in Pasadena, Texas operates several plastic resin manufacturing processes and one specialty chemical manufacturing process. The plastic resin manufacturing processes utilize various regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1,3-butadiene, isobutane, propane, and pentane to produce plastic resin.  The specialty chemical manufacturing process utilizes the regulated flammable chemicals such as ethylene, 2-methylpropene and propane. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS), associated with a flammable substances at HCC, is an instantaneous loss of the conten"

HCC informs contractors of known potentials fire, explosion or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process as well as the emergency action plan, safe work practices and sign-in/sign-out requirements for HCC during the Contractor Safety Orientation.  The contractor employer is responsible for assuring that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job.  To verify that each employee has the job skills necessary to safely perform the assigned job, an Employee Training Observation Form must be completed by a representative of the contract employer prior to the employee performing work at HCC.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe intent of the mechanical integrity program is to provide a management system that ensures:  (1) the equipment is maintained in a manner to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical and  (2) the equipment is maintained by trained and qualified personnel to assure its continued integrity.  The Mechanical Integrity Covered Equipment (MICE) at HCC includes the following type of equipment, pressure vessels,\nstorage tanks, piping, valves, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  The basis aspects of the mechanical integrity system include:  (1) design and construction requirements; (2) preventive maintenance practices; (3) testing and inspection; (4) repair, modification and alteration procedures; and (5) inspector and craftsman training and qualifications.  \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nHCC has several long-standing safe work practices that promote worker and process safety.

These procedures along with others form a system to help secure that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\n\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nHCC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  Changes may introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards incorporated in the original design of the process and must be reviewed prior to their implementation.   This system requires that change to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), software, procedures (including operating, maintenance, and safe work) and emergency procedures be properly reviewed and authorized using the MOC/PSR Certification form before being implemented.  This system requires that any change executed address the following: the technical basis for the proposed change; the impact of the change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  \n\nAffected process safety information (e.g. mechanical, electrical/instrument, chemical, and operating limits) and procedures (e.g. operating, maintenance, and safe work) are updated to incorporate these changes.

SOP's are readily accessible to operations personnel in the control rooms and all other employees via the electronic delivery system, PRiSM.  The SOP's address various phases of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations; emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and subsequent startup.  SOPs also address safety and health considerations and information on Safe Work Practices.  Revisions to SOP's may be prompted as a result of management of change, process hazard analysis, and an annual review of SOP's.  \n\nTraining\n\nHCC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all HCC employees especially those involved in operating a process.  Operator Training has been developed to equip operators with the knowledge and skill necessary to safely and proficiently perform their job duties.  This training emphasized specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  Written tests, oral tests, observation, or demonstration are utilized to verify the training.\n\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible.
