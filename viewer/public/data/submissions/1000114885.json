The most prominent of these include reducing exhaust emissions, improving fuel economy, prolonging oil-drain intervals, and extending equipment life.  The Facility has one regulated flammable substance (2-methylpropene, commonly referred to as isobutylene) and two regulated toxic substances (chlorine and carbon disulfide).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies (68.155(a))\n\nThe Facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  The Facility invests in accident prevention, including, but not limited to, the Facility's training of its personnel and the Facility's commitment and consideration of safety in every phase of its operations- from the design to the installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. The Facility has a Spill Prevention, Containment, and Countermeasure (SPCC) policy which addresses prevention of foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as the circumstances that if an accidental release occurs, how its personnel will respond to, control and contain that release.    \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(c)) \n\n(A)\tChemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n(i)\tToxic Substance Scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for toxic release is a catastrophic failure of a 90-ton chlorine railcar, resulting in a release of 179,000 lbs. of chlorine gas over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures is taken into account in evaluating"

      "SummaryText": "this scenario.  Because the plant is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach off-site public receptors. \n\nAn alternative scenario for chlorine is a failure of the 2-in. diameter liquid charge line between the railcar and the vaporizer.  If this scenario were to occur, automatic sensors (low pressure SIF and area monitor interlocks) would detect chlorine and shut off flow from the railcar immediately, accounted for as active mitigation with reduction of 0.99.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary. \n\nAn alternative scenario for carbon disulfide is a failure of a 0.25-in. diameter hole in the liquid charge line from a storage tank to a reactor.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the tank within a few minutes.   With the assumption that it requires approximately 15 minutes to stop the spill, the results from our analysis should be larger than would actually be the case if this event were to occur.  The toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach nearby public receptors.\n\n(ii)\tFlammable Substance Scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammable release is a vapor cloud explosion involving a full railcar inventory of isobutylene.  The maximum railcar inventory of 160,000 lbs. is assumed to be released to the atmosphere, to completely vaporize, and to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. The overpressure generated by the explosion would reach nearby off-site public receptors.  \n\nAn alternative scenario for isobutylene is a rupture of an unloading hose from a railcar containing isobutylene.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off the flow from the railcar within a few minutes.  For this scenario"

      "SummaryText": ", however, we chose to assume that it takes 15 minutes to stop the release, so that the results from our analysis should be larger than would actually be the case if this event were to occur.  The isobutylene spilled during this 15-minute period is assumed to ignite, resulting in a pool fire.  The excessive thermal radiation generated by the pool fire would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary.\n\n(B)\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA risk management program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements that are part of the RMP prevention program and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n(1)\tEmployee Participation\n\nThe Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.\n\n(2)\tProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a number of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the facility are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs"

      "SummaryText": ").  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures for each process, and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n(3)\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the each covered process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis (PHA) results at least once every 5 years until a process is no longer operating. Between formal PHA reviews, the Facility conducts Potential Problem Analyses (PPAs) when changes to the process warrant such an evaluation. This mechanism also ensures that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n(4)\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe Facility maintains"

These written procedures are used for both reference and training materials.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\nIn addition, the operating procedures at the Facility provide guidance on how to respond in the event of an exceedence for process or equipment specific parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n(5)\tEmployee Training\n\nThe Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for any employees involved in operating a process.  After successfully completing initial training in the operations of the facility, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n \nAll operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Each employee's training is documented, including the verification that the employee understood the training.\n\n(6)\tContractors\n\nThe Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant perso"

Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n(7)\tPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n(8)\tSafety Reviews of Mechanical Integrity and Equipment\n\nThe Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain major process equipment and emergency response systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

This system requires that changes to the process that are not considered replacement in kind are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected process information and operating and maintenance procedures are updated accordingly, and training is provided, as needed.\n\nAdditionally, the Facility has incorporated a formal review system for organizational and personnel changes.  This review focuses on the supervisory and support staff roles that provide management or technical support to the processes to ensure process safety and process support responsibilities are continuous throughout the change.\n\n(11)\t Incident Investigation\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release that caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n(13)\t Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Afton facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain and control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease detection- The following methods are in place to detect various incidents and provide an appropriate signaling mechanism or other remedy to control any effects that may be caused: \n- Chemical detectors with alarms and/or automatic shutdown systems\n\nRelease containment and control- The following methods are in place to control any releases:\n- Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and/or automated)\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n- Vesse"

      "SummaryText": "The site completed implementation of the Meridium software system  and will continue to consolidate maintenance and inspection information into the system, which has allowed for improved tracking of key metrics and better visibility of inspections.  Additionally,  the site has implemented the APS manufacturing production system aimed at standardizing work practices, engaging employees throughout the organization, defining and measuring key performance indicators, and driving efficient and consistent performance. Environmental, health, and safety has been integrated as a key pillar of the production system. \n\nFinally, Afton continues to reassess its current PSM and RMP practices to look for ways to improve these programs.  This ongoing effort is part of Afton's commitment to compliance and ACC's Responsible Care program."
