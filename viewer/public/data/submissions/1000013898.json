      "SummaryText": "7.0  RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND DATA ELEMENTS7.0  RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND DATA ELEMENTS\n\nThe following subsections outline the Executive Summary requirements of the EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.155.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Americold, Fort Smith (Plant #75119) facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Response Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\nTo save lives.\nTo minimize and avoid injuries.\nTo protect the environment.\nTo minimize property damage.\n\nAmericold, Fort Smith (Plant #75119) maintains an emergency response (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold, Fort Smith (Plant #75119) facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from th"

Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) is used as refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is above the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention.  \n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description removed per regulation\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nDiscussion removed per regulation\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\nIIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\nIIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\nIIAR Bulletin R1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIn addition, Americold, Fort Smith (Plant #75119) has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since December 1993 (PSM) March 99 (RMP Implement).\n\n FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been 2 Reportable accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years.  1) 8/17/04 a valve failed causing the release of about 1300 pounds. No damage (either on site or off site) was reported.  No off site evacuation was necessary. One person was slightly injured on site and no injuries were reported off site. The faulty valve was replaced.  2) A fork truck struck a strained valve causing the release of about 88 pounds. No damage (either on site or off site) was reported.  No off site evacuation was necessary. 5 persons were slightly injured on site and no injuries were reported off site. the valve was moved to a safer location and replaced. \n\nEMERGENCY RE"

      "SummaryText": "SPONSE PROGRAM\nAmericold, Fort Smith (Plant #75119) has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.   \n\nDuring the RMP Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures.  In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nDuring the review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the Americold facility located at 1634 Midland Blvd. in Ft. Smith, Arkansas.  These action items were entered into a management plan and have been addressed."
