              "Description": "The Hilight Gas Plant is manned 24/7 by trained operators. All processes are protected with overpressure protection that is subjected to regular and routine inspection and testing. There are both automated and manual alarms and shutdowns built in to the design and operation of this facility. These include hydrocarbon detectors and fire eyes in critical areas of the process including the compressor building which also has forced air ventilation fans to prevent the accumulation of flammable gases. The plant generates its own electricity so it is not subjected to power outages that might disable critical alarms or equipment. In the event the plant does lose power, all systems are designed to fail safe meaning that the inlet and outlet of plant would be blocked in and all pumps would shut down thus preventing the sale of off spec products or any chance of an overpressure situation from developing. \n\n\n\nThe entire facility is subjected to a mechanical integrity program to assure that critical covered equipment is adequate for the service and conditions expected. The intervals for inspection are determined both by the guidelines in the Process Safety Management program and the previous inspection results. All equipment is maintained to the standards recommended by the manufacturers. \n\n\n\nThe pressurized liquid storage areas of this facility are not diked as they contain liquids that will flash if released to the atmosphere and will not form pools. There is one area that has pressure vessels containing natural gasoline that is diked. The liquids in these tanks consist of heavier hydrocarbons (C6+) that would pool. \n\n\n\nWhile these liquids are stored in pressure vessels, the facility maintains a pressure of less than 15 psig. This pressure is applied to provide enough suction head to the load pumps. These liquids have not been considered in either the worst or alternative case scenarios as they will not form a vapor cloud. All pressure vessels have adequately sized relief valves that are either vented to a safe area or directed to a continuously burning flare. \n\n\n\nAll operators are extensively trained in the standard operating procedures at the plant including emergency response. Refresher training occurs on a regular basis and is repeated if there is any change in the emergency response plan. Drills are conducted to assure that personnel have the knowledge of their responsibilities during an emergency. \n\n\n\nThe entire facility has been evaluated using the \"what if\" method of performing a Process Hazards Analysis. All items identified during the PHA have been addressed and all changes to the process are managed using the Management of Change guidelines. All changes are documented and signed off on when implemented. All PHAs, MOCs, and operating procedures have been reviewed and revalidated at specific intervals.",

Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant is located about 20 miles south of Gillette, Wyoming.  The facility includes liquid recovery using a refrigeration system, compression, dehydration, power generation, and fractionation.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, liquid propane, liquid butane and a mixed natural gas liquid stream (natural gasoline).  The liquid products contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier components.  The liquids that are recovered from the refrigeration process including propane, butane and the natural gasoline are shipped from the plant by truck and railcar.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Hilight facility.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program.  This program as well as the other documentation is maintained at the gas plant. In addition the PSM program requires that we address process and employee safety issues as part of our normal operations.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, and participation in flowsheet reviews. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant uses the What If/Checklist method of performing a process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the hazards associated with the process.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Hilight gas plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the company has a program in place that evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  No contractor is allowed to perform work at the plant unless they have met the requirements of this evaluation process.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nThe Hilight gas plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  All of these activities are tracked and documented using Avantis, an asset manager database.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process, 2) safety and health hazards, 3) applicable maintenance procedures, 4) emergency response plans, and 5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel, the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, 4) a permit and procedure to control spar"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Hilight gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, or significant environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits \n\n\n\nTo guarantee "
