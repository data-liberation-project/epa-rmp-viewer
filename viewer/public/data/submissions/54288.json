      "SummaryText": "The City of Olathe operates two water treatment plant facilities.  Water Treatment Plant No. 2 is a 36 million gallon a day lime softening plant.  This Risk Management Plant (RMP) covers the Section 112r of the Clean Air Act regulating substances maintained at Water Treatment Plant No. 2, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was performed of the chlorine system beginning with cylinder unloading and ending with the chlorine in solution.  A combination checklist and modified \"what-if\" type of analysis was used.  General questions regarding storage and use areas as well as practices and protocols associated with the management of the chlorination system were answered.  The checklists used included those from the EPA RMP General Guidance document, the Chlorine Institute, and one developed to ensure that all required elements of a proper PHA are completed. The checklists covered the hazards of the process, previous incidents, and engineering and administrative controls applicable to the process hazards. The PHA also covered facility siting, human factors, and all operating phases. The PHA was performed by a team with the appropriate expertise. The findings and recommendations from the PHA have been documented in the Process Hazard Analysis Report.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe Plant has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each element of the chlorination system routinely.  There are operations and maintenance manuals for each piece of major equipment, and personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on the system.  \n\nAt the beginning of each of the shifts and as each cylinder is changed, the valves and piping are tested for leaks and checked visually.  There are SOPs for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation.  The SOPs are written and posted in the appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general o"

Continuous ventilation is provided when a worker is present in the room by means of a ventilation switch external to the room.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nPlant personnel are allowed and trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by turning off a valve.  Any response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by the Olathe Fire Department.  The Plant has an agreement in place with the Fire Department.  The City of Lenexa Fire Department will assist with a worker rescue only.  A complete copy of the emergency plan is available on Site.  \n\nAccident History\nThe Plant has had no RMP reportable chlorine releases in the past five years.  The new system, with all of the additionally safety features, will ensure the safety of the Plant personnel as well as the surrounding area.  An incident occurred on June 9, 2008 involving a small release from the packing nut on the active chlorine cylinder.  The incident was identified when the chlorine concentration in the treated water began falling.  The source of the leak was identified and the system was taken off-line and repaired.  One employee sought first aid; however, medical treatment was not required."
