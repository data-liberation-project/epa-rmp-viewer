In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacility Information:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 424510, \"Grain and Field Bean Merchant Wholesalers\", however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include receiving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code \"424910, Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers\".  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time.\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  Nurse tanks are filled and picked up by customers for transport to their fields.  Additionally, a conversion of phosphoric acid and anhydrous ammonia into a liquid fertilizer, 10-34-0 is performed by a 3rd party.  They bring equipment onto the site and handle all products to finish product into storage tanks.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the offloading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\r\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.
