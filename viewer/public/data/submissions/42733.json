These assets began operating under the name Magellan Pipeline Company, L.L.C. on September 1, 2003.  Magellan Pipeline Company L.L.C. was subsequently changed to Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. on September 9, 2004.  Over the past five years, there have been no reports of a harmful butane release at this station.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe Allen Station is a pump station which boosts refined products flow from Allen, OK to Bearden, OK and Fort Smith, AR.  The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane.  The equipment which handles butane includes a pressure vessel and associated piping.  The butane pressure vessel and associated piping may contain as much as 252,300 lbs of butane.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe regulated butane mixing process in the facility is compliant with the thirteen (13) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  Although tornadoes were not specifically discussed in the PHA, the consequences of a tornado have been sufficiently discussed. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in last PHA for this facility.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented"

      "SummaryText": " to ensure the integrity of the PSM regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been no accidental release from the butane process at the Allen Station that has required reporting under the RMP rule.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years the butane process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process.  As opportunities for improvement associated with the butane process arise at the Allen Facility, they will be evaluated by Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P."
