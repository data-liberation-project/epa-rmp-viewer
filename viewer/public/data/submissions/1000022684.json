California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\nA?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR A?68\nA?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR A?5189\nA?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR A?1910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sandrini Sales has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1    SANDRINI SALES, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sandrini Sales has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess 1: North Refrigeration; Ammonia; 13,000 lb\nProcess 2: South Refrigeration; Ammonia; 7,700 lb\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nSandrini Sales has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1.    Prepared a unified program based on the PSM"

Utilized PSMWriter&copy; software to ensure that all necessary Sandrini Sales employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\nThe Sandrini Sales facility is a commercial cold storage facility for table grapes.  The facility has two ammonia systems (north & south) that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold storage and precool rooms.  Four rooms are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, while eleven others are cold storage rooms.  Both kinds of rooms are equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There are cooled hallway areas as well. \n\nEach system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted outside the rooms.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessels located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to reciprocating compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the primary accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operat"

      "SummaryText": "ion of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained or pumped into the high pressure receiver.  There are four high pressure receivers, two on the south and two on the north sides of the facility.   \n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia systems at this facility consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nSandrini Sales has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Sandrini Sales facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that these processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficie"

Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSandrini Sales has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nSandrini Sales's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nA?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR A?3220\nA?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR A?1910.38 \nA?

Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR A?1910.120(q)\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sandrini Sales continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sandrini Sales's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented. \n\nSandrini Sales has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sandrini Sales has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\nFor the future, Sandrini Sales now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sandrini Sales employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Sandrini Sales will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. "
