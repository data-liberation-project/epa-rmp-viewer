      "SummaryText": "The Archer Daniels Midland Quincy Packaging Plant, herein referred to as \u00bfthe Packaging Plant\u00bf, is instituting a Risk Management Program (RMP) for two separate processes utilizing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant:  the refrigeration system in the Margarine Packaging Plant and the refrigeration system in the Shortening/Liquid Packaging Plant.  The following elements are addressed in the program:\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPreventing the release of toxic and flammable chemicals is of paramount importance at the Packaging Plant due to the serious acute health or catastrophic effects that may result from exposure to toxic fumes or an explosion.  Management has made it clear that all leaks are to be taken seriously and that operation of the systems is expected to be performed in a careful and professional manner.  Emergency Response policy is predicated on the serious nature of any toxic or flammable chemical leak and stresses the importance of calling in properly trained and equipped employees (HAZMAT team) when a leak is beyond the capabilities of on-site employees.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Packaging Plant is owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company and is located at 2731 Refinery Road, Quincy, Illinois, 62305.  The facility packages margarine, liquid oils and shortenings.  The Packaging Plant uses anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to chill the refrigerated warehouse and to crystallize the oil using scraped surface heat exchangers.  The systems for the Margarine Plant and the Shortening/Liquid plant are completely separate systems that are located in two different areas of the facility.\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case scenario was built on the assumption that both refrigeration process systems are ruptured and discharge their entire contents over a ten minute period.  Such a scenario is extremely unlikely, but could occur due to a weather event such as a"

      "SummaryText": "tornado.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for both systems involve the case of an individual compressor system experiencing a piping flange gasket failure and releasing some of the contents of the system over a five-minute period.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for ammonia-specific prevention steps are detailed in the Packaging Plants Process Safety Management Plan for the ammonia refrigeration areas.  This program is maintained by the Packaging Plant Manager and covers areas such as standard operating procedures, employee training, etc.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years from the date of this plan, the Packaging Plant has had no accidental release from either of the ammonia RMP areas.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Packaging Plant emergency response procedures are detailed in the Process Safety Management Plan, which is maintained by the Packaging Plant Manager.  Essentially, properly trained Packaging Plant employees will handle small leaks, while more significant leaks will require the assistance of the HAZMAT Team with outside responders as backup.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nN/A"
