Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Stanislaus Farm Supply has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Stanislaus Farm Supply, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Stanislaus Farm Supply has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nProcess 1 includes two interconnected fixed pressure tanks with a total volume capacity of 28,057 gallons anhydrous ammonia. The requirement for maintaining a 15% vapor headspace results in the maximum intended inventory of 115,000 lbs. (both tanks).\n\n\n\nProcess 2 includes multiple co-located field tanks with an aggregate quantity of approximately 300,000 lbs. anhydrous ammonia. The definition of \"process\" includes \"any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release\" per CalARP Section 2735.3 (kk).\n\n\n\nThe field tanks include 1,000 gallon (~4,000 lb. @ 80% capacity) and 500 gallon (~2,000 lb. @ 80% capacity) trailer-mounted units. The fixed tanks in Process 1 are used to fill the field tanks with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nIn general, Stanislaus Farm Supply regulated processes operate as follows: Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed as fertilizers for crop production nutrients.

      "SummaryText": "ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in two (2) above ground storage tanks. Anhydrous ammonia is transferred to nurse tanks for delivery to farmers. Both the ammonia storage process and nurse tank process at this facility consists of vessels which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the ammonia storage process and nurse tank process are each treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage processes at the Stanislaus Farm Supply facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that these processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur operations personnel monitor the process and keep track of all transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked by an outside contractors.\n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"E"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Stanislaus Farm Supply continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Stanislaus Farm Supply's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Stanislaus Farm Supply's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nStanislaus Farm Supply has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document "
