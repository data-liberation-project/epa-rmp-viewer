Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous\nsubstance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and \nprocedures be in place to protect employee and public health andsafety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Underwood Fruit & Warehouse to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nAs of October, 1999.We have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by WAC 296-67-017. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of WAC 296-62-3112. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. \n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\nUnderwood Fruit & Warehouse stores and distributes fruits. Storage and distribution requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the fruits. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 13,893 pou"

There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation\n       measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA. Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView III (Version 1.0) system. This \nsystem estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and\nenvironmental receptors are within the circles.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. Catastrophic failure of the medium pressure receiver located outside the Main Engine Room when\nfilled to the greatest amount would release 3,910 pounds of liquid ammonia. This scenario presumes that the entire \ncontents are released.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.8 miles from the point of release. This distance extends\nbeyond the facility fence line, and would encompass a population of about 1,000 with the closest residence approximately \n1/4 mile from the site. A school and hospital are about 1/2  mile away, inside of this release zone. The Columbia River, a city park, a restaurant, a RV Park, a Mini Mall, a store and a lumber mill are within close proximity of the facility. No other public or environmental receptors are located within this zone.\n\n\n\nThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g., earthquake) physically compromised the tank.\nThe structural integrity of the tank is safeguarded by periodic inspection for mechanical integrity to prevent a rupture due to tank degradation. The tank is also safeguarded from rupture from over-pressurization. It is a rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 375 psi and equipped w"

The design specification of the tank only allows a maximum capacity of 80% at 80 degrees F, limiting the total amount of ammonia in the system. During high demand, the Medium pressure receiver may only be filled to 50 % of capacity. In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling\nprogram, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly.\n\nAlternative Scenario. Several alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1? opening in a high pressure liquid line. Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a \nrelease duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 3,464 pounds of liquid ammonia. This scenario was selected \nbecause a release of this type would be more likely to occur indoors resulting in a lower potential exposure to Offsite receptors.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.3 miles from the point of release. This distance extends\nbeyond the facility fence line, and would encompass a population of about 500 with the closest residence approximately 1/4 mile from the site. A school and hospital are about 1/2 mile away, ourtside of this release zone. The Columbia River, a city park, a restaurant, a Mini Mall, a RV park and a lumber mill are within close proximity of the facility. No other public or environmental receptors are located within this zone.\n\nThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release\nduration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves. In addition predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-\n       Specific Prevention Steps\n\nUnderwood Fruit & Warehouse complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all"

Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee\nparticipation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Underwood Fruit & Warehouse Safety Supervisor.\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process,\nthe operating procedures, and safety considerations. This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of\nAmmonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).
