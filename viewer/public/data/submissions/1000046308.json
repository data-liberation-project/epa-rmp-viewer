In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.\r\n\r\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. \r\n\r\nThe existing ammonia refrigeration system at Carla's Pasta, 50 Talbot Lane, South Windsor CT is a two stage ammonia refrigeration process consisting of screw compressors, evaporative condensers, a high pressure thermosyphon receiver, an intermediate pressure intercooler, a low pressure ammonia recirculation package, evaporators, frezers, and other equipment. The existing system has an ammonia inventory of more than 10,000-lbs.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Carla's Pasta is primarily used to freeze freshly made pasta food products. \r\n\r\nThis facility follows the rigorous fourteen element OSHA Process Safety Program and EPA Risk management Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. Employees and management participate and cooperate in both process safety programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no ammonia releases in the last 5-years that meet USEP"
