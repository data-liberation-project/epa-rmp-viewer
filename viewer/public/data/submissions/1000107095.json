Stateline Processing, LLC has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe plant is designed to treat and process natural gas. Processing of natural gas is performed by cryogenic means, requiring propane as a refrigerant. Propane is stored in a pressurized vessels.\n \nCryogenic natural gas processing yields natural gas liquid (NGL) products, which are stored in pressurized vessels prior to shipment offsite via pipeline.\n\nThe Facility operates a stabilization process to reduce vapor pressure of recovered condensate for storage in atmospheric tanks.
