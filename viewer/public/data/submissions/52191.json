      "SummaryText": "Description of Water System\nThe City of Faribault, Minnesota serves more than 21,100 customers with an average demand of 3.1 MGD and a peak water demand of 7.0 MGD.  The City obtains all its water supply from five wells and it is pumped to a one million gallon low-level reservoir.  The raw water entering the reservoir passes through a chemical feed manhole where chemicals are added to the water.  Chemicals added include chlorine gas, ammonia, hydrofluosilicic acid and polyphosphate.  All chemicals are housed in the high service pump building.  Water from the low level reservoir is pumped into the distribution system by four (4) high service pumps.\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\nThis is a local government owned and operated facility for the production of potable water for the City of Faribault. The only reportable regulated substance for the RMP plan is chlorine. No more than two tons of chlorine is stored at this facility in ton cylinders. Normally only one cylinder is online at one time. The online tanks are on isolated regulators that reduce the chlorine pressure to 26.6 PSI. Chlorine feed equipment supplies a vacuum to the tanks allowing the release of chlorine to the feeders. The tanks are shut off with a manual valve and all residual chlorine is evacuated from the lines when the plant is off. No flammable substances or other restricted items are stored in the chlorine tank rooms. The room has a chlorine detector connected to an alarm panel, and autodialer. All unacknowledged alarms initiate the autodialer, which calls all on duty and off duty personnel till acknowledged. If the alarm is acknowledged and the condition exists after an hour it again starts calling operators out. All alarms and autodialers are on back up battery power supply.\nWorst-Case Scenario (WCS)\nThe worst-case scenario would be the total loss of one ton of chlorine through catastrophic valve or tank failure. There are no mitigation controls. Response time could be so limited (less than"

According to EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities criteria, the distance to toxic endpoint for this WCS is 1.3 miles.  The estimated population within this radius is 5800 persons.  Public receptors within this area include schools, residences, commercial and industrial buildings, retail stores and public parks.\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nValve failure or leak while tank is being worked on. Disregarding minor releases the less worst-case scenario would be chlorine pressure reducing valve (CPRV) failure, CPRV to tank connection, or tank valve leak. Operators would close the tank valve either shutting chlorine off or reducing the flow to a manageable level for repairs. \nThe release chosen is a release of chlorine at a rate of 60 lb. per minute in the chlorine storage room.  Passive mitigation is considered for the release occurring inside the building.  The distance to toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.2 miles, which reaches residential housing and an estimated population of 60 persons within the radius.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention\nOperators are trained in the proper way to change CPRV's and tanks. Regular maintenance is kept on the CPRV's, lines, and feeders. Cylinders with exceptionally difficult or tight valves are rejected and returned. Self contained breathing apparatus and tanks are kept in a separate room. Operators are trained in proper leak detection and correction. Two operators are required for tank changes or repairs. A third operator is notified of any leaks and told to notify emergency responders if communication is lost for more than 15 minutes. \nFive Year Accident History\nNo accidents or chlorine releases in the last five years. \nEmergency Response Program\nAs per written emergency manual. The manual is stored by the MSDS manual. These manuals along with the operations manual are stored in the plain view.  The Water D"
