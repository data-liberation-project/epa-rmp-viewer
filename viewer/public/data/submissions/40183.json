      "SummaryText": "The facility addressed in this report manufacturers curing agents, polyester resins, and alkyd resins.  The regulated substance covered by 40 CFR Part 82 used at the plant is Toluene Diisocyanate Mixture.  The material is stored on site prior to be used in the manufacturing of curing agents.  The facility has an accidental release prevention and emergency response policy that addresses the facility commitment to preventing accidental releases and responding to emergencies in an expeditious manner to prevent or minimize off-site impacts.  Senior management is committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures to prevent accidental releases.  The facility is subject to U.S. OSHA Process Safety Requirements specified in 29 CFR 1910.110 and has implemented programs and procedures addressing the requirements of these regulations.  Additionally the facility is subject to the Federal EPA Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Regulations specified in 40 CFR Part 112.  A spill plan has been developed for the site to address the prevention of spills and response to spills.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances covered by 40 CFR Part 82 over the past five years. \n\nThe site emergency response program includes the training of on-site personnel on the measure to be taken during various type emergencies projected to occur at the site.  Information has been provided to the local governmental agencies that may be required to respond to an emergency regarding chemicals insignificant quantities stored on-site.  Notification to the public of incidents requiring public response will be through the local governmental agencies.\n\nAt this time there are no proposed changes to be made to the site to improve safety other than those changes that are made based on the facility periodic review of process safety."
