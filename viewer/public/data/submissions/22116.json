The plant has a complete set of 40 CFR on site.\n\nThe Environmental Engineer prepares a Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation on an annual basis in December of each year.  This is required by the storm water permit, which was issued by the Utah Division of Water Quality.  It addresses the compliance status of the plant and discusses any releases, which occurred to air, water, or land.  It also addresses the general condition of the plant.\n\nIn addition, the Environmental Engineer prepares an air emissions inventory on April 15 of each year and a toxic release inventory on July 1 of each year.\n\nThe following safety procedures for the HCl storage tank are implemented at Compeq International:\n\nSecondary containment around the tank; surface area is 324 square feet\nContainment wall is high enough to hold entire contents of tank (8000 gallons)\nTank is new and will be installed in July 2000\nOverfill alarm system\nTank within a tank; outer tank is fiberglass; inner tank is HDPE\n\n2.
