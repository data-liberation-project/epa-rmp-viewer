We want to state that all the information in this report is based on the most accurate data available.\n\nII. Accident Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRosina Food Products requires all employees be informed of accidental release and emergency response policies.  Employees receive packets entitled Evacuation Plan, Lockout/ Tagout Procedures, Personal Protective Equipment, Hazard Analysis, Drum and Other Small Spills, and Hazard Communication Program.  Employees are subject to mandatory OSHA training.  During this class, Rosina informs employees about accidental release and emergency response policies.\n\n\nIII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nRosina Food Products manufactures Italian-meat specialty foods such as but not limited to meatballs and Italian sausage.  In order to sustain desirable freezer and refrigeration temperatures, we use anhydrous ammonia.  Approximately 11000 pounds of ammonia are re-circulated through three separate systems located at 75 Industrial Parkway.  The systems, consisting of pipes and storage vessels, are located in close proximity to each other.  The vessels are not filled to capacity.\n\nIV. Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Case Scenario\n\nTo calculate the distance that any released ammonia can still be toxic, we used RMP Comp provided from the EPA's web-site.\n\nA. Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario occurs if our largest vessel fails.  The vessel holds 1636 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The tank is limited to a third full.  If failure occurs, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles.\n\nB. Alternative Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative case scenario occurs if our vessel fails for the frigoscandia.  The vessel is filled with 730 pounds if anhydrous ammonia.  The tank is limited to a third full.  If failure occurs, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\n\nV. General Accident"

      "SummaryText": "Release Prevention Program\n\nWe seek to prevent accidents by exercising several approaches.  We are in compliant with SARA Title III and OSHA PSM.  All employees are subject to OSHA and emergency training in a classroom setting.  Mollenberg and Betz maintain our anhydrous ammonia systems to prevent any leaks or failures.  We administer safety drills annually.\n\nVI. Five Year Accident Report\n\nWe have had zero accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nVII. Emergency Response Program\n\nRosina Food Products has an existing emergency response policy that we coordinated with appropriate responders.  All employees are aware of this plan.  In case of a release, several members of our emergency team will be notified.  Earl Loder, the Disaster Coordinator of the Town of Cheektowaga, will notify the community and all relevant emergency responders.  Emergency responders consist of Southline Fire Department, Cheektowaga Police Department, Department of Emergency Services and DEC Emergency Spill Response.  Emergency contacts employed at Rosina include Charles Battaglia, Jim Calhoun, James M. Corigliano, Donald Dzieciuch, Kevin Kowalik, Joseph Lascola, Mike Mangino, Alan Miles, Eric Naber, James Stock and Bruce Stolinski.\n \nThe plan is tested and evaluated annually.  The most recent test occurred in October 1998.  The test includes a problem that would that necessitates the evacuation of the facility and involvement of emergency responders.  We involved our own emergency responders, the Cheektowaga Police, and Southline Fire Department.\n\nVIII. Planned Changes\n\nWe are constantly updating and improving our facility.\n\nIX. Conclusion\n\nRosina has some on site chemical compounds that may cause emergency action.  We will continue to maintain a professional outlook when it comes to the people and environment surrounding our facility.\n\nWe hope the EPA considers all possible consequences before releasing this detailed information of this RMP.  We wish to prevent any di"
