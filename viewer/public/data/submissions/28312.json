Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have four RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Sulfur Dioxide,Chlorine and Cyclohexylamine. Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substance are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Chlorine is received in 150 pound cylinders which are stored at the Chester facility for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Chlorine onsite at any one time will be 19000 pounds.\n\n2. Sulfur Dioxide is received in 150 pound cylinders which are stored at the Chester facility for distribution to end use customers.The estimated maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide onsite at any one time will be 7500 pounds.\n\n3. Cyclohexylamine is received in 45000 pound tank trucks and repackaged into 55 gallon drums and then stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers   \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RM"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is  the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, UNIVAR USA Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
