This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Nitrochem L.L.C. plant is located in Newell, Pennsylvania.  This facility processes Nitric Acid in various blends and mixtures to meet exacting customer specifications.  Nitric acid goes into the production of many of the modern comforts we enjoy in today's society. These industries, amongst others, utilize nitric acid as part of their production system for specialty steels, high-end electronics, plating, fertilizer, and explosives. The facility procures Oleum, Weak Nitric Acid, and Strong Nitric Acid from commercial suppliers. The strong nitric acid is mixed with weak nitric acid to create blend acid solutions, or mixed with oleum to create mixed acid solutions.\n\nThe facility has Oleum (20%) and nitric acid above the threshold quantity as regulated toxic chemicals that are part of the RMP program. The model used for the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Case Scenarios (ACS) is the EPA's RMP*Comp(tm).  It lists oleum as (30%) only; this facility utilizes Oleum (20% and 35%).  Additionally, nitric acid is listed as 100%, this facility uses 98%.  The facility's covered processes require the application of the RMP Program 3 criteria.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were completed utilizing the EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) modeling system.

For all the scenarios, the type F atmospheric stability class was used.\n\nToxic Substance\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with the release of a toxic substance is a storage tank containing nitric acid.  This scenario would release 713,775 pounds of nitric acid over a 10-minute period.  The release would involve a liquid spill and vaporization of nitric acid.  The release rate would be 71,377.5 pounds per minute.  The wind speed would be 1.5 m/sec.  The topography used in the model is urban.  The distance to the endpoint is 25 miles and would effect a residential population of 1,032,120.  The public receptors, within the distance to endpoint would include; schools, residences, hospitals, prisons/correctional facilities, recreational areas, and other major commercial, office or industrial areas.  The environmental receptors, within the distance to endpoint would include officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges and federal wilderness areas.  The release would reach a public receptor at the ERPG 2 concentration.\n\nThere are two alternate release scenarios for toxic chemicals that would have off-site consequences.  The chemicals involved are nitric acid and oleum.  These events are selected as being practical scenarios for use in emergency planning and response.  Although we have controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario.\n\nScenario-Nitric Acid (conc.80% or greater)\n\nThe ACS for nitric acid involves a pipe leak of liquid nitric acid in the amount of 379 pounds.  The release rate would be 75.9 pounds per minute for a 5-minute period.  The wind speed would be 1.5 m/sec.  The topography used in the model is urban.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  Each process area also has available all the equipment listed including what, if any, chemicals or hydrocarbons are present and a hazard rating based on the National Fire Protection Association system.  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, and pressure) and has studied hazard scenarios through the Process Hazards Analysis process.  The facility ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Nitrochem L.L.C. facility has a program in place to help ensure"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards, and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these\n\nThe facility uses primarily the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and \"What-If\" Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP and \"What-If\" Checklist analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a multidisciplined team with various experience backgrounds.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are documented for local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PRA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  Resolution of items can be categorized as procedures, repairs of existing equipment, engineering studies and installing new equipment.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in a facility item tracking process.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Nitrochem L.L.C. facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
