This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Nitrochem L.L.C. plant is located in Newell, Pennsylvania.  This facility processes Nitric Acid in various blends and mixtures to meet exacting customer specifications.  Nitric acid goes into the production of many of the modern comforts we enjoy in today's society. These industries, amongst others, utilize nitric acid as part of their production system for specialty steels, high-end electronics, plating, fertilizer, and explosives. The facility procures Oleum, Weak Nitric Acid, and Strong Nitric Acid from commercial suppliers. The strong nitric acid is mixed with weak nitric acid to create blend acid solutions, or mixed with oleum to create mixed acid solutions.\n\nThe facility has Oleum (20%) and nitric acid above the threshold quantity as regulated toxic chemicals that are part of the RMP program. The model used for the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and Alternative Case Scenarios (ACS) is the EPA's RMP*Comp(tm).  It lists oleum as (30%) only; this facility utilizes Oleum (20% and 35%).  Additionally, nitric acid is listed as 100%, this facility uses 98%.  The facility's covered processes require the application of the RMP Program 3 criteria.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were completed utilizing the EPA's RMP*Comp(tm) modeling system.

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Nitrochem L.L.C. facility encourages employees to participate in all elements of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include employees serving as members on process hazard analysis teams as well as incident investigation teams.  Employees also serve as trainers and procedure writers.  Employees also form the emergency response team and hazmat teams for the facility and receive training to maintain qualifications; participate in safety and environmental meetings.  Our process unit operators monitor their areas of responsibility and provide monthly reports on the status of various safety and emergency response equipment.\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Nitrochem L.L.C. facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  Each process area also has available all the equipment listed including what, if any, chemicals or hydrocarbons are present and a hazard rating based on the National Fire Protection Association system.  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, and pressure) and has studied hazard scenarios through the Process Hazards Analysis process.  The facility ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems)\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operator's.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified, by operators and management, as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change (MOC) process, described below.  These written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the operating and maintenance procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees are required to complete the facility-training program.  This program includes formal operations training, classroom training, on the job training, self-study training, and testing.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, perform their work in a safe manner, and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nOur contractor safety program is accomplished by providing contractors with an initial orientation meeting, prior to their beginning work, which provides site specific hazards by using safety information cards (SIC) Cards, information about general safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices.  In addition, the facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Nitrochem L.L.C. personnel periodically monitor contractor performance and perform various audits to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  A weekly Contractor Safety meeting is held with representatives of our contractors.  Contractors participate by presenting topics and the minutes are distributed to all attendees.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nFacility personnel conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemical technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

This scenario would release 713,775 pounds of nitric acid over a 10-minute period.  The release would involve a liquid spill and vaporization of nitric acid.  The release rate would be 71,377.5 pounds per minute.  The wind speed would be 1.5 m/sec.  The topography used in the model is urban.

The environmental receptors, within the distance to endpoint would include officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges and federal wilderness areas.  The release would reach a public receptor at the ERPG 2 concentration.\n\nThere are two alternate release scenarios for toxic chemicals that would have off-site consequences.

HAZOP and What-If Checklist analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are documented for local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PRA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.
