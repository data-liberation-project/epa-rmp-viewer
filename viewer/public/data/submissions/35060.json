The District encompasses an area of approximately 2,000 acres and is bordered by Broad Creek on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Shipyard Plantation and Long Cove on the south, and Hilton Head Public Service District No. 1 to the north.\n\nThe Broad Creek PSD Facility\u00bfs treatment capacity is two million gallons per day, and meets Advanced Waste Treatment standards.  The facility uses a multistage treatment process to treat the incoming wastewater flow.  The biosolids in the wastewater flow are separated from the effluent water.  The biosolids are used in the District\u00bfs innovative composting system to produce a high grade environmentally safe soil conditioner.  The treated, clear effluent water is disinfected using chlorine prior to discharging the effluent for reclaimed water applications. \n\nChlorine is received and stored at the facility in one ton cylinders.  Chlorine gas is greenish yellow in color and liquid chlorine has a clear amber color.  Chlorine gas is approximately 2 \u00bd times heavier than air and liquid chlorine is approximately 1 \u00bd times heavier than water.  Chlorine in non-explosive and it\u00bfs odor is easily detectable at very low concentrations.\n\nThe official policy of the Broad Creek PSD Commission is stated as follows:\n\n\u00bfThe personal safety and health of each employee of the Broad Creek PSD is of primary importance.  The prevention of injuries and illnesses is of such consequence that is will be given precedence over the normal operations and functions of the District whenever necessary.  To the greatest extent possible, the Commission will provide all mechanical and physical facilities required for personal safety and health in keeping with the highest standards.\u00bf\n\nTo help in the prevention of accidental releases of chlorine, Bro"
