Cartex is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nCartex Corporations policy:\n-\tComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\n-\tReview and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety and environmental improvements.\n\nA combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of employees, the public, as well as protection of the environment. The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner, including the implementation of the Program 2 elements as outlined in the Risk Management Plan. To ensure that the RMP program is appropriately developed, implemented, and maintained, the Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manager the program. \n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary operation at Cartex is to manufacturer polyurethane foam for the automotive industry. The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals immediately prior to pouring the mixture into a pre-shaped mold that is attached to carriers on a moving carrousel line. After the pouring takes place, the molds moved through a curing oven. Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are manually removed from the molds, crushed, trimmed, and prepared for shipment to customers. \n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is the main reactant required to produce polyurethane foam. TDI is regulated under EPA\u00bfs RMP program rule. TDI is received at the"

TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer controlled system. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the facility is 275,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCartex complies with various OSHA regulations, EPA Clean Air Act, DOT transportation of Hazardous Goods, and NFPA Codes through specific prevention programs.\n\nKey features of the prevention program for use of TDI at Cartex include:\n\n\u00bf\tSafety information\n\u00bf\tHazard review\n\u00bf\tOperating procedures\n\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00bf\tEquipment maintenance\n\u00bf\tCorporate audits\n\u00bf\tAccident/Incident investigation\n\u00bf\tEmergency response\n\nAn established Isocyanate control program outlines the hazards of handling TDI and the controls which are in place to reduce the hazards of Isocyanate exposure to employees, the community and the environment.\n\n4.\tFive year history\n\nThere have been no TDI releases that qualify for listing in the EPA\u00bfs required five year history report.\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nAn established integrated contingency plan consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. An internal Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level and is capable of responding to any chemical release at this facility. The ERT members participate in drills simulating different TDI release scenarios. The Emergency Response Plan is also coordinated with the LEPC and fire department. Local hospitals have also been given information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll safety management systems are reviewed on a continuous basis and updated when necessary.
