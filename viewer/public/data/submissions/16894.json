The City of Hays WastewaterTreatment Facility (WWT) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that intergrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The WWT emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb.  The WWT chlorination system has been installed to disinfect the flow of wastewater releases to Chetahola Creek and to the reuse of reclaimed water for irrigation purposes.  The chlorination station is located on the Old Hiway 40 Bypass, approximately three quarters of one mile east of the intersection of Vine Street and the Old Hiway 40 Bypass.  The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, a chlorinator, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers and a 150-lb cylinder.  Because the chlorinator building is located on the wastewater treatment site, the chlorinator building is normally unmanned, however, the waterwater treatment facility is manned 24-hours per day, seven days per week and periodic checks of the chlorinator building are made throughout the day.\n\nc.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ...maximum quanitity in the largest vessell... is released as a gas over 10 mimutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".
