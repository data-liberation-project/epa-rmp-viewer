Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Midwest Co-Operative (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and propane are stored at the facility in storage tanks; 12,000 gallons and 30,000 gallons for ammonia; 18,000 gallons for propane.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 178,500 pounds.  The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 56,600 pounds. \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.\n\t\t\n\t\tAnhydrous Ammonia- The maximum quantity released would be 178,500 pounds, \t\twhich represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as \t\t\tlimited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to \t\t\t200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.6 miles.\n\n\tPropane- The maximum quantity released would be 56,600 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles, or 1,580 feet.\n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most \tlikely potential incident) are as follows:\n \n \tAnhydrous Ammonia- The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a \t3-inch transfer hose followed by r"

(ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.
