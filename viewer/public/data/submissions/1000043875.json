The Water Department is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Section Safety Supervisors are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the pump station. In addition, the Department has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothetical potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe chlorine system at Glorietta Park Pump Station of City of Glendale Water and Power is used for the chlorination of drinking water.  The Glorietta Park Pump Station uses chlorine for odor control, filamentous control, and disinfection of water from Glorietta Reservoir.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored for the chlorination process is 4,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Glorietta Park Pump Station's chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  In the chlorine storage room at the Glorietta Park Pump Station, two one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.

A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from any one-ton container, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping. Any chlorine gas in the tubing upon loss of vacuum, downstream of the regulator, will be drawn through the ejectors and into solution.  \r\n\r\nAfter passing through the vacuum regulator, the chlorine gas is sent to a chlorinator.  The chlorinator is equipped with a rotameter to monitor and regulate the amount of chlorine that flows to the injectors.  Still under vacuum from the chlorinator, the chlorine gas is drawn to the injector located in the chlorinator room and is mixed with water to produce chlorine solution.   At the mixing point of chlorine and water, the solution becomes sufficiently diluted to no longer merit concern.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine system at Glorietta Park Pump Station employed by the Glendale Water & Power is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential chlorine related accidents and to allow operators to monitor system operations.

In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensor / detector, 2) alarms, and 3) ChlorTainers.\r\n\r\nThere are two chlorine detectors where one is located at the Chlorine Storage Room and the other is located at the Injection Room.  At 1 ppm, the chlorine sensors will trigger a visual alarm located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room. Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine alarm system will notify operators of the chlorine leak through the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.  The chlorine alarm system also will circulate the air in the building.\r\n\r\nAn automatic switchover function on the vacuum regulator allows only one of the two containers to feed chlorine at a time.  When the vacuum regulator detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. The heater is used to ensure that chlorine does not condense.  All empty tanks connected to the system are replaced with a full tank delivered from the vendor.  This replacement is done by City of Glendale Water and Power operators using a monorail hoist.\r\n\r\nTGO Technologies, Inc. is the developer and manufacturer of the ChlorTainer, a vessel designed to contain the accidental release of liquid chlorine or chlorine gas.  The ChlorTainer is designed in accordance with ASME requirements and is capable of containing pressure releases of up to 250 psig and 300\u00b0F.  In the event of a failed container, the system will protect the operator as well as the external environment from exposure to chlorine gas or toxic levels of chlorine gas.

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of Glendale Water and Power employees. Since the Glorietta Park Pump Station is an unmanned facility, no evacuation would be required in case of a chlorine release.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of Glendale Water and Power responsible person, Ms. Miriam Caro Sykes, at least once a year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study conducted on May 7, 2014, generated mitigation measures to improve safety at the Glorietta Park Pump Station.  The Revalidation was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine system since the previous HAZOP Revalidation study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 2009 PHA Revalidation study, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the completion of chlorine checklists, and the completion of the HAZOP log tables.  The recommended changes are scheduled to be completed by May 2015.\r\n\r\nI"
