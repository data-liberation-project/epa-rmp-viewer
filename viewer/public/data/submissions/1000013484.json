One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Milton Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at the Milton Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Tomah's Milton Plant.\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is two-fold. First of all, it evaluates the consequences of incidents that could occur or the quantity of a release required to have an off-site impact.  Secondly, it has a systematic prevention program which is designed to prevent these potential incidents from occurring. \n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant is committed to the safety of the plant's workers and of the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to minimize such releases. Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant evaluates each situat"

In the unlikely event that we would have a release, we have an internal and external emergency warning system to notify our workers and/or the community.\n\n1.2 The Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nAir Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant handles seven substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:\n    \n??A? Acrylonitrile is used to prepare intermediate products that are then converted to finished amine products.  It is one of the basic building blocks which is incorporated into nearly all of our finished products.\n??A? Ethylene Oxide (EO) and Propylene Oxide (PO) are used to produce specialty products called alkoxylated amines or tertiary amines.  These alkoxylated amines are used in industrial, institutional and agricultural products.\n??A? Methyl chloride is used to prepare other specialty surfactants.  Methyl chloride quaternizes the alkoxylated products (it makes the products carry a positive charge).  These materials are used as emulsifiers and cleaning agents.\n??A? Ammonia is used in the production of amines to minimize side reactions.   It is subsequently recovered in the ammonia recovery system, which forms ammonia water and ammonium phosphate. \n??A? Ammonia water is formed when we recover the ammonia used in the process.\n??A? Hydrogen is used to hydrogenate nitriles to amines that are used in iron mining, fuel additives and further reacted to other surfactants.\n\n\n\n11.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the  Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant.  Because the process at the Milton Plant is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation and is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process saf"

      "SummaryText": "dequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary or that these measure would improve operability.  All action items in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.   Action items are tracked until they are complete.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.   Operating procedures include information on safe handling of our hazardous materials.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedu"

New employees receive \"front-end\" training in the  Milton Plant operations.  This training heavily emphasizes the safety, health and environmental systems and procedures that pertain to the site and the employee's job.  After successfully completing this training, a new technician is paired with a senior technician to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  Additionally, a comprehensive, independent-study program is required.  This training program includes more specific details on safety and job-related tasks.  After technicians demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.   Finally, monthly training sessions are provided which cover all regulatory training and other general subjects.  All of this training is documented for each technician, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\nThe Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Milton Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: \n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n(3)  are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n(4)  understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n(5)  understand and follow site safety rules, and \n(6)  inform Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \nThis is accomplished by providing cont"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new or existing hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  In fact, we investigate all incidents or potential incidents, however minor.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Milton Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Air Products Performance Manufacturing - Milton Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being i"
