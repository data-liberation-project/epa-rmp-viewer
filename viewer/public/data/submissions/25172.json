Flange gasket leak of ethylene oxide on oxide distribution line with off-site impacts. \n? Flange gasket leak of propylene oxide on oxide distribution line with off-site impacts.\n? Flange gasket leak of ethylenediamine on EDA distribut ion line with off-site impacts.  A dike is taken into consideration as passive mitigation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe  Prevention Act.\n\nSignificant chemical-specific prevention steps that are found at the facility include:\n? Being prepared to handle unexpected rises in temperature and pressure by using automatic shut-off device and relief valves.\n? Multiple layers of protections such as safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors.\n? Identifying potential problems by continuously monitoring pressure in vessels and piping.\n? Ensuring proper operation by regularly inspecting equipment.  \n? Ensuring staff and cont"

The release occurred from a pump transferring dilute ethylene oxide.  As corrective action, pumps that transfer ethylene oxide no longer use packing glands.  Although an evacuation of the surrounding neighbors was taken as precautionary measure, there was no adverse impact to the community or BASF employees.\n\nPropylene Oxide:  This facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\nEthylenediamine:  This facility has had no accidental release over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.

      "SummaryText": "re water and fire sprinklers.\n? Having portable emergency response equipment such as walkie-talkies, personal protective equipments (PPE's), absorbent materials, combustible vapor detectors, and fire extinguishers.\n? Training in proper first aid and medical treatment.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and others.\n\nEmployee's suggestions are encouraged and evaluated for its feasibility.  This facility believes that an employee's suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how, and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.  \n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n? Switching to gaskets that are more resistant to corrosive materials.\n? Pumps which transfer ethylene oxide and propylene oxide no longer use packing glands.\n? Increasing the number of stationary combustible gas detectors.  \n? Readiness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) potential computer bug.\n? Connecting all stack emissions for ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and ethylenediamine to a central control device which decreases the emissions to the atmosphere."
