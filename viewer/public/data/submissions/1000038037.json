Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to CEP Mid-Continent LLC (CEP).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all CEP facilities.  CEP facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  CEP facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.:  pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response.  This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n\n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Cobb Compressor Station is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substance at the facility is a flammable chemical mixture, Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The mixture includes N-pentane, isopentane, N-butane, isobutane, propane, ethane, and methane.  These chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000lbs, individually, and a 1wt% if in 10,000lbs of NFPA 4 flammable mixture.  NGL is considered NFPA 4 and some RMP flammable chemicals are present at concentrations >1wt%.  The facility has one aboveground storage tank for NGL that has a maximum capacity of 12,000 gallons.  With administrative controls, the capacity is limited to 9,600 gallons.\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)    Worst-Case Release Scenario and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  The worst-case release scenario (WCRS) would be a rupture of the NGL Product Storage Tank.  Such a release has the potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exp"

      "SummaryText": "osed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance of Offsite Consequences Analysis, the WCRS distance/endpoint was calculated to be 0.3 miles from the tank.  Based on this distance and using EPA's MARPLOT software with 2010 census data, it was determined that there are no public receptors were within the WCRS endpoint.  However, there appears to be a residence withing the WCRS endpoint, with an estimated 2 occupants.  Thus, facility has assumed Program 2.  Though not required for a Program 1 facility, an alternate release scenario was also evaluated, arriving at a 0.2mile endpoint.  Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls have been implemented/installed as safeguards to prevent deviations outside safe operating limits.  Administrative controls include limiting the maximum fill level of the NGL storage tank and utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility.  Mitigative (engineering) safeguards include such things as high pressure/overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc.\n\n\n\n(d)    Hazard Communication Program.  CEP has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures:  1) an MSDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled/marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n\n\n(e)    Five Year Accident History.   The Cobb Compressor Station has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\n\n\n(f)    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  CEP is always looking for ways to improve their safety program.  CEP believes the effectiveness of the safety program is directly proportional to employee involvement and senior management support.  Two tasks are being performed:  1) current training programs are being evalua"
