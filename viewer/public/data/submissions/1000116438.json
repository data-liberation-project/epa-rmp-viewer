Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\nOSI West Chicago Plant is a food processing facility that runs a continuous operation. OSI utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration. Two closed loop refrigeration systems are required to freeze the produced product and maintain the facility's temperature. OSI has a total of 29,500 pounds (30,000 pounds rounded to two significant figures) of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite. One closed loop system for product freezing contains approximately 15,700 pounds and the other closed loop system for maintaining plant temperature contains approximately 13,800 pounds. The two systems are interconnected through a pump out line.\n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
