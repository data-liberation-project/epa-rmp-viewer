      "SummaryText": "Town & Country Co-op is a farmer owned co-op providing services and products to our customers for use in production agriculture.  One of these products is anhydrous ammonia which provides a low cost, easy to handle source of nitrogen for corn and wheat production.  Our facility has an 18,000 gallon storage tank, which is considered full at 85% capacity from which we transfer ammonia to smaller tanks for sale to our customers.  We also can receive anhydrous ammonia by 180,000 # rail cars.  Town & Country has not had any injuries or accidental release of product on record for the past 5 years.  With our on going maintenance and safety programs and continued safe handling practices our plan is to keep this number at 0.  Local fire departments and other emergency response receive periodic updates on the facility and proper response to an ammonia release or injury.  Using Degadis & EPA guidelines, a major release of product would be the result of a rupture in the main storage tank resulting in a complete dispersal of product in20 minutes or less.  This could affect an area of up to 1.28 mile radius around the release site resulting in the possible evacuation of population down wind from the release site.  If an incident occurs the Branch Mgr. Is to contact the proper emergency response people per our company emergency action plan.  Plant personnel have also been trained to seek safe haven.  A more likely scenario would be a transfer hose rupture, releasing product to air.  In most of these cases built in excess flow valves would automatically shut off the flow of product minimizing the release.  Due to a smaller release the area around the release site affected would only be .3 miles or less.  With our current safety record we anticipate no changes in our operation or our training procedures at this time."
