WTS has only one process that uses the following compounds: Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia more than 20%. Our worst case scenario is the release of Anhydrous Ammonia, it is limited to 1.9 miles, as determined by the RMP Comp modeling. WTS maintenance and other programs has allow us to operate without serious accidents since its foundation in 1974. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES 40 CFR 155(b)\n\nWTS manufactures ammonia solutions of different concentrations. The facility operates 1 process that has 2 RMP regulated substances, anhydrous and aqua ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia storage is a 10,000 gal. steel tank with a safe capacity of 8,500 gal., limited by administrative procedure. The maximum storage of anhydrous ammonia is 42,600 lbs (8,500 gal. X 5.01lb/gal.) The aqua ammonia storage tank is a 20,000 gal. epoxy coated steel tank. There are other processes which deal with manufacturing of filters, ion exchange equipment and regeneration of ion exchange resins, which do not have RMP regulated substances."
