The Tanner family started out in the ammonia business in 1955 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The company has grown to it's current size through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower Ammonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in 1991. This particular facility was established in 1981.\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or exceed our customers needs, to distribute our products in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide continuity for the business and employment for our employees. \n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia. Our commitment to the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP) provides our company with an integrated health and safety, environmental, and product stewardship program that is supported by our strong corporate capabilities. Our dedication to the proper distribution and stewardship of ammonia includes involvement in emergency response training for first responders and other industry personnel to enhance the protection of our employees"

      "SummaryText": "Inc considered a 160,000 pound release of anhydrous ammonia as the worst case\nscenario. The release event resulted from the entire contents of the largest vessel, in this case a railcar,\nemptying in 10 minutes. Since ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, the release would result in a\ndual-phase flow. Dual-phase flow means that the material would simultaneously flow as a gas and a liquid\nand then vaporize into a gas. The dual-phase flow was automatically considered by the software for this\nscenario. Liquid ammonia spills also undergo a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This is an\neffect that is demonstrated by a decrease in the internal temperature of an ammonia pool due to\nvaporization. This characteristic essentially decreases the vaporization rate of an ammonia pool. Thus, the\nvapor cloud from a liquid release would diminish over time and the endpoint would be dynamic. An\nincreased effect could be expected if the release were to occur within an area that limited the exposed\nsurface of the pool. Neither the  auto-refrigeration property of ammonia or any other mitigating factors\nwere a consideration used in this scenario. \n\nThe off-site area impacted by the release could experience ammonia concentrations of 200 parts per million\n(ppm). Please refer Section 2, Worst Case Release Scenario of the Risk Management Plan for further\ninformation.\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia\nTanner Industries, Inc considered a conservative alternate case scenario. We selected a release amount of\n150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is 150% of the maximum amount released at any of our\nfacilities based on our five year accident history. We applied this conservative scenario to all of our\nfacilities for the following reasons:\n    a) All of our facilities store and handle anhydrous ammonia.\n    b) All of our facilities use the same basic processes in their operation.\n    c) The potential for this amount to be released at any of our facilities does exi"

In support of our policy, the following is a typical list of safety equipment and systems employed at this facility. \n\n   a) Pressure relief valves are employed on all storage, transfer and delivery equipment to handle unexpected increases in pressure. Per their operational design, these valves will reset after relieving only the excess pressure. Depending on their situational placement in the process, these valves may be designed to relieve pressures caused from either vapor or liquid.\n\n   b) Excess flow shut off devices are incorporated through out the process as prescribed by federal regulation. These valves are designed to stop the flow of liquid material any time their rated flow capacity is exceeded. These valves are designed to prevent the catastrophic release attributed to a storage tank line or valve break.\n\n   c) Regular facility and equipment inspections ensure safe and proper operating conditions."

The material is transported to our facility by rail car or tank truck and then transferred from this equipment to either our on-site storage vessels or transport cargo tanks. From the storage vessels the material can be repackaged for bulk or non-bulk distribution to end-users.\n\nThe potential maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored at this facility on any particular day is 676,000 pounds. It is only on rare occasions when these potential storage quantities are actually achieved. Each storage vessel is limited by federal regulation to 85% of the maximum volume of the storage vessel. The maximum quantity handled at any particular time would occur during the transfer from a railcar to a storage tank and that quantity is 133,000 pounds.\n\nAt this facility, blending of a product we call aqua ammonia is also performed. This material, ammonium hydroxide,  is a solution of ammonia and water. In order to avoid minor releases of anhydrous ammonia vapor, our handling processes institute closed loop systems that capture the ammonia gas in water. This solution is transferred into a process vessel where the volume is increased and the ammonia concentration standardized for distribution into the commercial market. This product, even at low concentrations, is still a hazardous material due to the ammonia that vaporizes off of it.\n\nThe potential maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that could be stored at this facility on any particular day is 502,000 pounds. Again, it is only on rare occasions when the potential storage quantities are actually achieved. The maximum quantity handled at any particular time would occur during the transfer from a process vessel to a storage tank and that quantity is 72,600 pounds.\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses.

      "SummaryText": "a are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an ozone safe refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, reprographics, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.  Accompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be auto-repulsive. These  characteristics provide us with an early warning of the material's presence and force us to retreat from ammonia contaminated atmospheres.  High concentrations could have more serious health effects. These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.\n\nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Material Safety Data Sheets, wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training programs as prescribed by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n \nSafety Improvement Process:\n\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.
