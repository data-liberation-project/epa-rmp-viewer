Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\n     The Coca-Cola Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with our regulated processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if such and accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Apopka Fire Department and the Florida District 6 LEPC for emergency  response support.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\n     This facility is used for the production of juice and fruit drink products.  Ammonia is the only \r\nRMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The systemA\u00bfs purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for certain products.  The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system totals approximately 16,200 pounds.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n     The facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311 / 312 notification / reporting requirements.

Operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n          Process Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\n     As part of the ammonia refrigeration system installation process and as required under PSM, the facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with its ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  These studies, using What if scenarios, will be repeated every 5 years by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the process hazard analysis will be addressed n a timely manner.\r\n\r\n          Operating Procedures\r\n\r\n     In order to safely conduct activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, The Coca-Cola Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators and contractors who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n          Training\r\n\r\n     The Coca-Cola Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in al relevant operating procedures.  Refresher training provided at least every three ( 3 ) years or more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\n          Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\n     The Coca-Cola Company carries out and documents maintenance checks on ammonia refrigeration system equipment to ensure proper operation.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation is made of the contractorA\u00bfs safety performance.  The Coca-Cola Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work with the ammonia refrigeration system.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\r\n\r\n5. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\n     The facility has not experienced any ammonia releases in the past five years.  As part of a facility modification, the ammonia refrigerating system at this facility was completely rebuilt in 1998.  Prior to its re-commissioning in late 1998, the plant was idle for two years.\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\n     The Coca-Cola Company Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency with local emergency response agencies performing all rescue, fire fighting, first-aid, medical treatment and other response functions.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan that documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies including an ammonia release.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies which are responsible for notifying the public.
