Certain raw materials and by-products are toxic chemicals that are regulated under EPA Risk Management Programs regulations that can be hazardous if released to the air in large quantities.\r\n\r\nDover Chemical Corporation is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an emergency, we will immediately mobilize our emergency response team to contain and minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through local emergency management agencies.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nTo minimize the potential for a chemical release , our facility maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving a hazardous chemical.  The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\n\r\nOur facility is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the EHS Manager and the PSM/RMP Leader have assumed responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  We have also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the twelve prevention program elements.\r\n\r\nOur prevention measures include, but are not limited to, the use of:\r\n\r\n- Chlorine and hydrochloric acid process area detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\n- Fence line chlorine and hydrochloric acid detectors to assist in emergency resp"

No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident and a portion of the surrounding community was sheltered-in-place as a precaution. Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries. There was some onsite property damage. \r\n\r\nOn November 04, 2011 a release of Chlorine of 82 lbs, hydrochloric acid of 71 lbs, chloroform of 6487 lbs occurred.  The release was to air.  There were three on-site personnel injuries.  There was some minor onsite property damage.  No deaths or injuries occurred offsie as a result of this accident.  Davis road was shutdown as a precaution.\r\n\r\nIn each scenario, the incident was reviewed and corrective actions were generated to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\n\r\nIn the event that a chemical release does occur, Dover Chemical has an emergency response program that includes trained onsite emergency responders and coordination with the City of Dover Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. If an emergency did occur, plant personnel will immediately activate our emergency response team to contain and minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through local emergency management agencies.\r\n\r\nPlanning to Maintain a Safe Operation\r\n\r\nDover Chemical continually works to safely manage the hazards of chemicals to protect employees and the community we serve. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analyses and coordinate with the community emergency response organizations."
