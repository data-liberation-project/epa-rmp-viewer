Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia-related incidents at the Good Humor Breyers Huntington facility within the last five years that have resulted in any onsite or offsite impacts.\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Huntington facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Huntington Fire Department and The Huntington LEPC.\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n\n7 Organization Plan and Responsibilities \n7 Communications Procedures \n7 Detailed Action Plans\n7 First Aid Procedures \n7 Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures \n7 Evacuation Plans\n7 Description of Outside Assistance Available \n7 Site Re-Entry Procedures\n7 Training Programs and Drills\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral recommendations to improve safety were made for either the equipment (hardware recommendations) or the system operating procedures (procedural recommendations) when a process hazard analysis (PHA) study was carried out on February 2-3, 1999 for the ammonia refrigeration system at the Huntington facility.  The recommended changes have been evaluated by management and are being addressed and resolved in a timely manner."

Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor - Breyers operates an ice cream production facility in Huntington, IN.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is 61,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system has been made subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Huntington facility involves the release of 11,752 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the high- pressure receiver (No. 2).  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as is could be at most 70% full during normal operating conditions. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 Industry standards were followed for the manufacturer and quality control of these lines;\n7 Ammo"

The RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements and numbering sequence of the final EPA RMP submission.  \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor - Breyers recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Huntington facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the"
