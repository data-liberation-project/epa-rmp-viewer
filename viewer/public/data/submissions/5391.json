The Facility Policy: The owners, management, and employees of the East Peoria Wastewater Treatment Plant are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with the chemical.  Should an accident occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is Wastewater Treatment and in conjunction with this operation, the handling, storage, and use of chlorine for disinfection of wastewater.  Chlorine is received, stored and used for wastewater disinfection. The maximum quantity stored in a facility process is 12,000 pounds (6 storage containers).  The capacities of the individual storage containers are 2000 pounds each.\n\n3.   The Worst-case Scenario: would be the release of the total contents of a storage container released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 2000 pounds, which represents the volume of a single storage container.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of dispersion based on the RMP*Comp V1.06 model is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of container (or line) with a 0.2 inch diameter hole, releasing 2000 pounds over 20 minutes.  The chlorine storage room is enclosed and the model includes mitigation by the enclosure. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.2 miles.\n\n4.   The accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations as set forth under USEPA  40 CFR 68, EPCRA 302, and IDOL.\n\n5.   The Five-year accident history: There have been no accidental releases of chlorine for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, i"
