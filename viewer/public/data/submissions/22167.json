The facility Policy\n\t\n\tThe owners, management, and employees of Osborne Elevator are committed to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  if an accidental release\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and\nthe environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\t-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale\nto farmers.\n\n\t-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct\napplication and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production.\n\n\t-The maximum quantity stored would be 131,125  pounds in our one 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled wouldbe the unloading of a tractor trailer holding 48,000 pounds. \n3.  The worst - case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n  \n\ta.  The worst - case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n131,125  pounds, which represents the volume of the storage  tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 2.41 miles.\n\n\tb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to\nthe endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by The American\nNational Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety a"
