The storage tanks have nitrogen gas blanketing, and there is an emergency blanketing system using natural gas.  There are emergency shutdown systems to close valves to the reactors and shut off the charge pumps.  Preventative maintenance and inspections are performed on equipment.  We also have trained operators and emergency responders and written standard operating procedures.  The PHA on 5/98 was for the nitrogen system to the storage tanks.  The PHA's for the storage tanks themselves and the reactors are being completed in June 1999.",

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of oil field chemicals.  We have eight regulated substances present at our facility that are over the threshold amount.  The toxic substances include Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia, Ethylene Oxide, Formaldehyde 50% solution, and Propylene Oxide.  The flammable substances include 1-Butene, Isopentane, and Isopropylamine.\n\nThe regulated substances are involved in several uses.  Ammonia and Isopropylamine are used in acid neutralization reactions.  Ethylene Oxide and Propylene Oxide are used in alkyloxylation reactions.  Formaldehyde solution is used in the production of resins.  1-Butene and Isopentane are used in the production of a pipeline drag reducing agent.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  All of the scenarios used urban site topography.  The Worst Case Scenarios assume Class F atmospheric stability and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s.  The Alternate Release Scenarios "

      "SummaryText": "assume Class D atmospheric stability and a wind speed of 3 m/s.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Ethylene Oxide.  The scenario involves the release of 128,775 pounds of Ethylene Oxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes were not used, as this feature would be ineffective for the gas release.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each of the five toxic substances present.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ethylene Oxide involves a release from a relief valve on one of the oxide reactors.  The Ethylene Oxide storage tanks were not used for the ARS since the tanks have gas detectors and an automatic deluge system and there would be minimal release of Ethylene Oxide to the atmosphere.  Assume 10 minutes for the release time, as plant personnel should be able to identify the cause of the relief valve opening very quickly and stop the Ethylene Oxide flow to the reactor from either the pump itself or from inside the control room.  The release rate would be 80 pounds/min.  This is the typical maximum flow rate of Ethylene Oxide from the charge pumps.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia assumes that a 2\" transfer hose breaks during unloading.  Assume 30 minutes for responders to identify leak, change into appropriate PPE, and isolate the leak.  The release rate would be 7,500 pounds/min.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Aqueous Ammonia also assumes that a 2\" transfer hose breaks during unloading.  Assume 10 minutes for responders to identify and isolate leak.  The liquid release rate would be 1,377 pounds/min., with the total quantity of liquid released being 13,770 pounds.  Using a maximum pool area of 7,574 sq. ft., the release rate from the pool is estimated to be 345 pounds/min.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for Formaldehyde, 50% solution assumes a leak off a line of the storage tank.

Using a maximum pool area of 1,794 sq.ft., and the LFB for the pure substance, the release rate from the pool is 126 pounds/min.  Only the first 10 minutes of evaporation were considered as the release rate would decrease rapidly as the substance evaporates and the concentration decreases.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario for Propylene Oxide assumes a leak off a line of the storage tank.  The largest storage tank, T-255, is not in a diked area, nor does it have gas detection or a deluge system.  The Propylene Oxide is stored at 65 psig.  Assume the hole is 1/2\" in diameter.  The highest level in the tank is 100\".  Assume a release time of 10 minutes for the leak to be discovered and stopped.  The liquid release rate would be 381 pounds/min, with the total quantity of liquid released being 3,810 pounds.  The evaporation rate from the maximum pool area is 502 lb/min.  Since that rate is higher than the actual liquid release rate, use the liquid release rate of 381 lb/min.\n\nThe worst case scenario for flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Isopentane from a railcar.  The amount of Isopentane released is 156,900 lbs.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable substances as a class involves a release of Isopentane during unloading operations.  Isopentane is transferred from a railcar to a storage tank by pressuring the railcar to 45 psig, and is then sent through chemical hoses and hard piping to the storage tank.  Assume it would take 10 minutes for responders to discover the release and shut off the flow.  The liquid release rate would be 67 lb/min, with a total liquid quantity of 670 lbs.  The release would take place in an undiked area.  The release rate from the pool is calculated to be 1"
