W. 11th Street\nRichmond, IN  47375\n\nNAICS #: 31152\n\nProcess: \n\nSmith Dairy is a milk and dairy processing plant that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for the purpose of cooling product during the process operation and for product storage. The refrigeration system at the Smith Dairy Wayne Division is a single stage, closed loop system with a total system charge of 16, 939 pounds of ammonia.\n\nChemical Hazards of Anhydrous Ammonia:\n\nPermissible Exposure Limit -- 25 PPM for 8 hours\nShort Term Exposure Limit  --  35 PPM for 15 minutes\nImmediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH)  --  300 PPM\nInhalation Hazard  --  1,000 PPM\nSkin Absorption Hazard  --  10,000 PPM\nLower Explosive Limit (LEL)  --  16%\nUpper Explosive Limit (UEL)  --  25%\nEPA Toxic Endpoint  --  200 PPM\n\nWorst-case Scenario Data:\n\nThe worst-case release, toxic endpoint was determined using the RMPComp software provided by EPA. The worst-case scenario is based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel Designation  --  Pump Recirculator \nVessel Size  --  60\" x 10' 0\"\nMaximum Vessel Quantity  --  5,550 pounds\nAmount Released  --  5,550 pounds\nDuration of Release  --  10 minutes\nRelease Rate  --  555 lbs/min\nWind Speed  --  1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric Stability  --  F\nTopography  --  Rural\nPassive Mitigation  --  Enclosure\nDistance to toxic Endpoint  --  1.0 mile\nAffected Population  --  1,858\nPublic Receptors  --  One Hospital, Residences\n\nThe maximum level is this vessel is controlled by the operation of a liquid line solenoid valve which is opened and closed by the vessels liquid-level probe. Should this control fail, high level cutouts will shut the system down stopping the flow of liquid to the vessel. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario Data:\n\nThe alternate release, toxic endpoint was determined using the RMPComp software provided by EPA. The alternate scenario is based on the following criteria:\n\nScenario  --  Release from a Pressure Relief Valve\nRelease Rate  --  43 lbs/min\nDu"

The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 'HAZWOPER'. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Smith Dairy has also coordinated response efforts with the local Fire Department personnel and community Emergency Management Agency. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSmith Dairy Wayne Division has not only complied with the EPA Risk Management Program but also the OSHA Process Safety Management regulation to assure that the Ammonia Refrigeration System is well maintained and employees are properly trained and periodically retrained to assure they are kept up to date on any changes and new operations that may effect them. In addition, to maintain the mechanical integrity and safety of this process, Smith Dairy practices the following industry codes and standards:\n ASME Boiler & Pressure Valve Codes\n ANSI B31.3 Piping Code\n IIAR industry guideline for safety and good engineering practices\n NFPA guidelines for fire protection equipment\n  \nThrough regular audits, training, maintenance, testing and inspection programs of the ammonia refrigeration system at Smith Dairy, the facility has established a history of safe operation and that community emergency action plans are current and training with"

The trained personnel will access each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. This facility has also established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and have included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation of equipment in the event of a release. Smith Dairy has purchased Level A Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all."
