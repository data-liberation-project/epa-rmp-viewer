All employees at the Green Bay Plant are provided with the training, tools, and authority to perform their duties in a safe manner.  Strict operational procedures and controls are in place to ensure safety from the conceptual stage through product development, manufacturing, handling and storage, and delivery to customers.  The Green Bay Plant has a staff of highly qualified safety and environmental professionals, engineers, and support personnel to assure implementation of, and an on-going commitment to, the highest standards of safe process management.  Their experience and professional competence have resulted in many years of safe operation which consistently exceed industry averages.\n\n\n\nResponsible Care Policy\n\nSAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT & SECURITY\n\nWe, the employees at OMNOVA's Performance Chemicals Division, will operate our facilities and conduct our busines"

The RMP-regulated substances used to manufacture these products are 1,3-butadiene (CAS# 106-99-0), acrylonitrile (CAS# 107-13-1), and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution (CAS# 1336-21-6; 7664-41-7 as ammonia).  Acrylonitrile and 28% ammonium hydroxide solution are the regulated toxic substances on site; and 1,3-butadiene is the regulated flammable substance on site.  Finished products are non-hazardous and are in the form of a low-viscosity, milky-white liquid emulsion.  \n\n\n\n?68.155(c) GENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n\n\nOMNOVA began a formal PSM program at its Green Bay Plant in 1992 after OSHA promulgated regulations at 29 CFR 1910.119.

Safety systems in place at the Green Bay Plant include combustible gas sensors and alarms, automatic controls, automatic shutdown systems, early suppression fast response systems (i.e. deluge water systems, foam systems, etc.), secondary containment dikes and below-grade vaults, and employees specially trained in chemical handling and emergency response.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions' overall safety efforts at the Green Bay Plant consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials, as well as programs to mitigate the effects of an actual release should it occur.  The Green Bay Plant has a trained and properly equipped emergency response team capable of handling foreseeable emergency situations.  Importantly, coordination with local emergency response agencies is a key element of our emergency response planning process.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies involving RMP-regulated substances within the facility.\n\n\n\n?68.155(d) FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe EPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information about all accidents in the last 5 years involving an RMP regulated substance if the accident resulted in (1) death, injury according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on site, or (2) known deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage off site.  \n\n\n\nNo accidents meeting this regulatory definition have occurred at the Green Bay Plant within the last five years.\n\n\n\n?68.155(e) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIntrinsic safety is a key element in the design of all process equipment at OMNOVA Solutions' Green Bay Plant.

Application of new design principles to existing equipment is also an important element of continuous process safety improvement.  In addition, formal incident investigation procedures are in place so that causes of even the smallest failures are identified and corrected.\n\n\n\nContinued training and planned drills will sustain and improve emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n\nOver the past five (5) years, the following projects have improved the plant's overall safety and environmental processes.  These include: \n\n\n\n(1) Increased frequency of facility inspections in critical processing areas; (2) Leak Detection and Repair inspection frequency increased to quarterly for Hazardous Air Pollutants and (3) Increased requirements for the facility's behavioral-based auditing program (People Based Safety) which includes employees at all levels of the organization\n\n"
