      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies for the Brasada Gas Plant, which is owned and operated by Western Gas Partners, LP (Western), (subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Cooperation). Because there are employees at the facility more than 4 hrs./day, the station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response \n\n\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Cooperation has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. APC has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies. If the situation requires, APC will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nLocation and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Brasada Gas Plant is a facility that receives production from Maverick Basin CDP via flow line. The production is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in to two pressurized bullet tanks, each with a volume of 50,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~200 psi.\n\n\n\nA total rupture of a 50,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Brasada Gas Plant. The 50,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 mile"

      "SummaryText": "s. There are no public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario will not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under 40 CFR 68. The Brasada Gas Plant does have 10 full time employees 24 hours a day.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) of flammable substances at the plant, is a  resulting from the release of  propane from a ruptured truck loading hose.  This will cause a release of 347 pounds of material.  The maximum distance to the 1.0 pound per square inch endpoint for this ARS is 0.3 miles.  This event was selected as being a possible scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  It is worth noting that there are no residences within the ARS 1.0 psi pressure radius. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Station has developed an emergency response plan, which has been communicated to and is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\n \n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through APC's Near Miss and Observation programs.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no accidental release history to report. Should an emergency or accidental release occur involving the Brasada Gas Plant NGL system occur, it is the Western policy to notify the Lasalle County and Cotulla Fire Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.
