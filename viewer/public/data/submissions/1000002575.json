      "SummaryText": "Owner information:\n\nCity Water and Light (CWL) is a publicly-owned improvement district that provides water, wastewater and electricity services to the city of Jonesboro, Arkansas (population est. 58,000)\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe CWL - Airport Pumping Station is a water treatment facility with a capacity of approximately 6 MGD. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in treating the water, and the maximum quantity stored at this facility is approximately 4,000 lbs.\n\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response:\n\nCWLA?s management takes safety issues and regulations very seriously.  It is our goal to ensure that all our operations are safe to our employees, the community and the environment.  We have a Compliance Specialist who helps monitor applicable safety regulations and coordinates appropriate training related to safety issues.  We have an extensive in-house safety program related to chlorine that includes training for employees who handle our chlorine.  We have our Risk Management Program Binder, which details our chlorine handling.  This manual primarily uses safety procedures recommended by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition, this program includes a chlorine emergency response plan.\n\nSome specific safety measures that we have in place are as follow: 1. Automated monitoring through our SCADA system that results in continuous real-time monitoring for leaks; 2. Automated dry scrubber (installed cost over $100,000) that is activated automatically in the event of a leak; 3. Chlorine repair kits; 4. SCBAA?s for each member of our in-house chlorine response team; 5. Routine training in both chlorine handling/leak response and respiratory training; 6. Involvement with the Craighead County LEPC.\n\nManagement will continue to make chlorine safety a priority at CWL.  We spent over $500,000 installing scrubbers at all of our in-town facilities with chlorine, which illustrates that chlorine safety is a priority for our utility.  We will continue to look for ways to improve "

      "SummaryText": "our chlorine safety.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chlorine-Specific Mitigation:\n\nOur release prevention program starts with our chlorine standard operating procedures.  The site has seismic constraints designed to limit movement of the cylinders.  Our chlorinators use a vacuum system design.  If a chlorine leak occurs, we have chlorine leak detectors that provide a local alarm and a remote alarm via our SCADA system.  The remote alarm is received at the CWL Dispatch Center, which is staffed continuously 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The chlorine leak alarms automatically activate a chlorine scrubber that is designed to vacuum the chlorine-contaminated air and neutralize the chlorine.  The result is relatively clean air being discharged from the scrubber to the environment.  If alarms are activated, chlorine response team members are trained to respond according to procedures and measures for emergency response after a chlorine release.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nCWL has had no reportable releases at this location in the past 5 years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nCWL has a good working relationship with the Craighead County LEPC and JFD, and we have provided copies of the CWL Emergency Plan, which includes information on chlorine release and notification.  The LEPC and CWL have agreed that even though CWL employees are not first responders, CWL shall take the lead in responding to a chlorine leak at our facilities because our employees are more experienced and receive more training related to chlorine leak repairs.  Our personnel have received outside training from our local water district.  We have in-house training classes that cover chlorine handling and leak repair.  In addition, our personnel have utilized training equipment such as A?dummyA? tanks and the standard chlorine leak repair kits to simulate leak repair procedures.  If a release of 10 pounds or more occurs, our personnel are to notify the LEPC/Office of Emergency Services, the A"

Public notification would be coordinated with the local Police and Fire Departments and the LEPC.  In the case of a major leak, local radio and television stations would be involved.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nCWL has greatly improved its chlorine safety program over the last three years by adding more training, developing specific standard operating procedures, performing a hazard review, and writing a more detailed policy regarding chlorine.\n\nCWL will continue to strive to improve our program by reviewing and revising all aspects of the Risk Management Program as necessary."
