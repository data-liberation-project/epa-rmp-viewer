Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LAAFP facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP proposed and submitted the RMP for LAAFP facilities in June 1999.  This RMP is the five-year update to the June 1999 RMP.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facilities consist of two different chlorination stations and one chemical depot; the LAAFP facility, the Los Angeles Reserv"

The above information for the three DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant facilities is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LAAFP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The LAAFP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe three LAAFP facilities are located in the same complex adjacent to the Los Angeles Reservoir in Sylmar, California.  The Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant treats up to 600 million gallons per day of water from the Los Angeles Owens River Aqueduct or from the Metropolitan Water District. Liquid chlorine is delivered to the plant in 90-ton railcars or by truck in one-ton containers. The 90-ton railcar is the largest vessel (container) on line. LAAFP can store a maximum of 6 railcars and 28 one-ton containers. \n\nThe Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Stati"

The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves much of the San Fernando Valley with potable water and feeds other reservoirs.  It also chlorinates the outlet flow from the Van Norman Bypass Reservoir and another pipeline called the Rinaldi Trunk Line.  This station stores chlorine in a 25-ton bulk storage tank; it can also store up to 12 one-ton chlorine containers to be used when the bulk tank is taken out of service for maintenance or repair. The 25-ton bulk tank is the largest vessel (container) on line. \n\nThe Van Norman Chemical Depot is used for storage of up to 100 unopened one-ton chlorine containers and up to 40 150-lb cylinders in addition to various other chemicals.   The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on-site.  The depot is equipped with a one-ton capacity dry medium chlorine scrubber which is activated in the event of a chlorine leak. \n\nAll three LAAFP facilities currently store and/or use chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the LAAFP facilities at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. Additional details of the three facilities are provided below.\n\nThe Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant\n\nLiquid chlorine is supplied to the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant in 90-ton railcars with a backup of one-ton containers for the chlorination process.  A maximum of three railcars or four one-ton containers can be connected to the chlorination process at any given time.  Liquid or gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the railcars.

Additionally, the detection of 10 ppm chlorine will automatically close the ball valves connecting the hard piping to the flex hoses stopping the possible backflow of chlorine, in case a crack developed in the flex hose. \n\nLiquid chlorine travels under pressure to any of the six evaporator units, while gaseous chlorine can be withdrawn directly to the chlorinators.  The evaporators vaporize the liquid in a water bath to form a superheated gas which passes through a pressure-reducing valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection lines at the appropriate rate.  Chlorine gas from the chlorinators is pulled by vacuum to injectors located on the downstream piping at various chlorine application points.\n\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor the railcar area, ton container storage area, chlorine pipe trench, and the chlorination room in the existing system.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine control panel in an adjacent room to the chlorination room, as well as at the operator's console in the control room. \n\nThe LAAFP control room at the plant is manned 24 hours a day, year round.  Access to the plant is through security gates, which are kept locked, or are staffed by security officers at all times.\n\nThe Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station\n\nAt the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station the primary supply of liquid chlorine is from a bulk tank.  A gas line is also connected to the 25-ton capacity bulk tank to serve as a backup supply if the liquid supply is disabled.

The gas discharge piping from the evaporators supply pressurized chlorine gas to the chlorinators through regulating valves.  A gas header from the bulk tank serves as a backup supply and automatically takes over when the evaporator is shut off due to a low temperature condition.  The bank of 4 one-ton containers can also feed liquid or gas through the header system to the evaporators.\n\nThere are a total of seven chlorine injectors located in the three injection vaults.  The injectors provide vacuum which draws chlorine gas from the chlorinators into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is piped through diffusers into the various water pipelines.  \n\nA chlorine leak detector is provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorinator and chlorine storage rooms.  The detector signals an alarm by activating (1) a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, (2) an audible alarm within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant Control Room.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet facility, an alarm will alert the control room.

DWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1994 and 1995, detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) were conducted for the two chlorination facilities and storage depot.  The PHAs were further reviewed in April 1999.  In February 2004 a PHA was again performed for the whole chlorination system and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions were developed in February 2004 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nA seismic walkthrough was recently completed based on the LEPC Region 1 guidance document, and recommendations were provided to DWP staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nDWP has prepared written operating procedures for LAAFP facilities that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to chlorination process.

The procedures call for the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination processes and other areas deemed appropriate as described in the procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place prior to the issuance of the hot work permit.  The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location and specific operational requirements and is kept on file in the administrative office. \n\nDWP Management of Change (MOC) procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel prior to implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, PSI, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nDWP certifies every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements are met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.\n\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader.
