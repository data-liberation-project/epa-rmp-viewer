We are developing and implementing  a combination of an accidental release prevention program and an emergency response planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we are implementing, including:\n\n     *    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's risk management plan (RMP)\n           regulation.\n     *    An overview of our accidental release prevention program.\n     *    A five-year accident history for accidental release of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n     *    An overview of our emergency response program.\n     *    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases \n           from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n2.0     Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Moberly's water supply and treatment facilities provide safe, reliable, and economical drinking water within the city limits.  In our treatment process, we use the following chemical the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  Chlorine\n\nChlorine is used as a disinfectant to inactivate disease causing organisms and to maintain high quality potable water during distribution.  The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at the plant site is 12,000 pounds.\n\nFlammables:  There are no RMP-regulated flammable chemicals used or stored at this facility.\n\nOur operational procedures "

This revision was made to address security concerns.\n\n4.0     General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The prevention programs in place include:\n\n1.     Regular review of safety information such as Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), daily\n         documentation of chlorine inventory, and regular updating of safety information to assure\n         accuracy and completeness.\n2.     Hazard review of the chlorination system using industry recommended checklists to assess\n         potential problems that could result in an accidental release, determine the safeguards needed\n         to control hazards or prevent equipment malfunction.\n3.     Written operating procedures that address initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations,\n         emergency shutdown, emergency operation, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or \n         emergency shutdown or a major change, consequences of deviations and steps required to correct\n         or avoid deviations, and routine equipment inspections.\n4.     Regular employee training to assure that each plant operator has the required knowledge, skills,\n        and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities assigned.\n5.     Written maintenance procedures and documentation to assure safe operation of critical equipment.\n        Operators routinely review these procedures prior to beginning maintenance procedures on the\n         chlorination"

The City of Moberly, Missouri and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we work, and we have specific assignments of responsibilities to ensure that we are meeting our standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.0      Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  We have had no accidental releases involving chlorine during the past five years.  If an accidental release occurs, we are prepared to conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause of the event.\n\n6.0     Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain a contingency plan, which is coordinated with the Moberly Fire Department for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively  protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We are coordinating our developing program with the Randolph County LEPC, the community emergency response plan, and the City of Moberly Fire Department.\n\n7.0     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at our facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n     1.     Increase plant security with a new 10 ft high chainlink perimeter fence and locked entry gates.\n     2.
