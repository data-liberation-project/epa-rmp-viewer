Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Piatt County Service Co. Monticello are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\n7 The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n7 The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 84,000 pounds\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\n7 The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a [storage tank or tank car] released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the [largest storage tank or tank car] as limited by design standards.  \n\n7 The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is .83 miles.\n\n7 The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n \n7 The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n\n\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This f"
