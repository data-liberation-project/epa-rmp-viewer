As part of their commitment, we have established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at this facility and that complies with the requirements for the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule)\nThe RM program at this facility consists to three (3) elements:\n1) A hazard assessment to help understand:\nThe potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases, and accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n2) A prevention program to help maintain end safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n3) An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases for regulated substances from covered processed.\nThis facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards or controls against release for a hazardous substance and injuries and damage to its employees, the public, and the environment. We limit the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment, and we take steps to prevent any such effects.\nThe safety program consists for a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. There are other prevention programs which are co"

This RMP plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at this facility that are required by the RMP rule.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases for hazardous substances. This facility implements reasonable prevention programs to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards at this facility.\nIn the event of an accidental release, we control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment. This facility coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response personnel.\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThis facility is primarily involved in the recovery of sour liquid hydrocarbons from a gas stream and the manufacture of liquid fertilizer. As part of this process, we handle regulated toxic substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. The following AMP regulated substances that exceed threshold quantity are found at this facility:\n1) Anhydrous Ammonia\n2) Hydrogen Sulfide\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public of the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consists for evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternate release scenarios were selected to help the local fire department or, if applicable, emergency planning committee improves the community emergency"

An alternate release scenario represents a release that:\n1) might occur at this facility\n2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nFacility Name: Table Rock Processing Plant\nEPA ID:\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). At distances less the endpoint distance, the effects could be greater, at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe Worst-Case release Scenario (WCS) for toxic substances is failure of the storage vessel, V-305 which can contain up to 240,000 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia. This scenario assumes that the entire content of this vessel is released in 10 minutes. The maximum endpoint distance is 6.8 miles One gasoline service stations with on-site residence are the public receptors within this endpoint distance.\nAlternate Release Scenario\nThe Alternate Release Scenarios (ARS) for toxic substances both involve hose ruptures that occur during transfer operations at V-305 (Anhydrous Ammonia) and V-118A (Hydrogen Sulfide). These scenarios assume that the toxic substances are released through the ruptured hose for a very short duration before the excess flow valve on the Anhydrous Ammonia and manual shut off valves on the Hydrogen Sulfide systems are activated and immediately shut off the flow to the rupture. The substances drift off-site to a maximum and point distance of .3 miles for the Anhydrous Ammonia and .5 miles for the Hydrogen Sulfide. No public receptors may be affected.\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility uses a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1994, this prevention program for processing of natural gas was formalized to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention"
