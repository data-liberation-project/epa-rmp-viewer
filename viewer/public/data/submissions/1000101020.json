These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe\r\nstartup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nThe Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nThe Facility promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading into the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nThe Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilities implementation of the RMP rule, including information from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors:\r\nOn occasion the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility. It is our goal to implement appropriate control\r\nmeasures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe facility's primary activities encompass vegetable processing and storage. We have 1 regulated substances( Anhydrous Ammonia) present at our facility. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to efficiently cool process water and cool air in the cold storages.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\r\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and\r\nthe RMP-COMP calculation program.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
