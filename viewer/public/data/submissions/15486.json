      "SummaryText": "HASA is subject to the Federal Risk Management Program because there are, on-site, in a rail road tank car or cars more than 1,500 pounds of liquefied chlorine gas.  It is highly unlikely that an event involving either liquefied or gaseous chlorine will occur at HASA because repeated, fail-safe controls, and chlorine monitors have been installed and HASA's HAZMAT employees, who unload chlorine at the site, are well-trained.  At the facility chlorine is reacted with an alkaline solution to form bleach solution, known by its chemical name as sodium hypochlorite.  HASA has been a good neighbor in the Pittsburg community for over three-years.  HASA is proud of its safety record.  During these past three years there has never been an accident which resulted in a chlorine release.\n\nBesides the manufacture of bleach solutions, HASA repackages disinfectants, sanitizers, additives, and specialty products for use in potable (drinking quality), recreational, and waste water disinfection and maintenance.  Recreational waters include those found in swimming pools, spas, hot tubs, and water parks.  Chlorine is stored and used in virtually every city and county in the United States at water and waste water treatment plants, sewage facilities, high school and college swimming pools, meat and milk packaging plants, fruit and vegetable washing operations at packing plants, etc.  It is a major component of many plastics, solvents, and refrigerants.\n\nThe company, family-owned and operated, employs over 20 local residents --with an annual payroll in excess of $ 0.5 million -- in many capacities: receptionists, accountants, telephone operators, sales and management personnel, and transportation and plan workers.\n\nRailroad tank cars containing liquefied chlorine are shipped from the states of Washington and Nevada to our site in Pittsburg by the Burlington Northern Railroad (formerly known as the Southern Pacific Railroad) and unloaded to the bleach-making process from our private siding."

    {
      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 15486,
      "SummaryText": "There are less than 100 pounds of liquefied chlorine at any one time in our unloading line and in the bleach-making process.  The chlorine unloading process and the unloading equipment are in accordance with nationally recognized standards including recommendations from the Chlorine Institute, ANSI B31.3, and an exemption issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation, DOT-E-10552.\n\nBleach solution, the result of our process, does not contain liquefied chlorine or any other substance regulated under the Federal RMP Program.  When HASA is not manufacturing bleach solution, all liquefied chlorine is removed from the unloading line, and remains in the railroad tank car located on HASA's private railroad track or siding.\n\nSchedule 80 black iron pipe, fittings, and appurtenances used in the chlorine unloading line have been installed in accordance with the material specifications in ANSI B31.3.  There are two flexible lines which connect the chlorine tank car with the unloading system: the one for transfer of liquefied chlorine; the other for application of dry air or padding the tank car to maintain constant pressure within the tank car while liquefied chlorine is being unloaded.  Each flexible line is connected to the railroad tank car by a fail-safe to close, remotely activated valve.  If power and/or air pressure are lost for any reason, a powerful spring closes the valve.  A remote chlorine detection system is installed adjacent to the chlorine tank car unloading area, along the line, and in the warehouse.   If chlorine were detected at approximately 1.0 ppm (1 part chlorine in 1 million parts of air), the detector would actuate a warning signal.  HASA also has a scrubber connected to the line which can evacuate chlorine contained in the line in less than 1 minute.  HASA HAZMAT employees are trained to respond to a chlorine leak.  Self-contained breathing apparatuses and a Chlorine Institute Emergency Kit C are onsite in case a leak is detected in the tank car."

      "SummaryText": "The C Kit contains tools and repair parts for tank car vales, punctures, pressure relief valves, etc.  The HAZMAT employees are regularly trained to respond to emergency situations.\n\nThe chlorine unloading line HASA been designed to resist damage from seismic and other emergency occurrences.  A similar line installed in our Southern California plant withstood -- without damage or leakage -- both the Sylmar earthquake and a plant fire in 1996.  In both cases there was extensive damage to the HASA facilities, but not the chlorine unloading line.\n\nHASA implemented a Risk Management and Prevention Plan in 1996 under the requirements of California Health and Safety Code Chapter 6.95, Article 2, which addresses many of the subjects required under the Federal plan.  HASA also has in place a Process Safety Management Plan in accordance with CalOSHA regulations at 8 CCR '5189."
