Analysis of the potential hazards of the\r\nprocess, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release\r\naccidents since Plains purchased the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking\r\nsteps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Owen Storage Terminal since Plains purchased the terminal or was\r\nreported under previous ownership and operation within the last five years.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency\r\nresponse groups such as the Owen Fire Deptment. Also involved in emergency response for the\r\nterminal would be the Clark County LEPC. The\r\nterminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency\r\nresponse. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers,\r\nthe public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety\r\nmanagement systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key\r\ncomponents of the safety program are:\r\n\u00bf The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change\r\nmade to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n\u00bf The Proces"

At the terminal, propane is received via railcar and stored in pressure tanks.\r\nPropane is loaded into transport trucks from the above ground tanks only. Propane is the only substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the\r\nOwen Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under\r\nthe regulation. We have two process at the facility LPG Storage Terminal and Rail storage area.  The LPG storage terminal has the larger off site consequence.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the\r\nhigh standards striven for by Plains. These high standards include:\r\n\u00bf Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining assets"
