(SRES) is a privately held company that \n\nhas been in the gas processing business for more than 50 years.  SRES operates Natural gas processing plants in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.    The Jal # 3 Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\n    \n\nThis facility gathers raw field natural gas for processing.  The facility and system of pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, New Mexico Oil Conservation Division, New Mexico Environmental Department, New Mexico Water Quality Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the United States Department of Transportation.  These agencies conduct periodic facility inspections and report any findings to SRES corporate management.\n\n\n\nOver the past 5 years there have not been any incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury at this facility. The Jal #3 Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  \n\n    \n\nThe Jal #3 Plant is located northeast of Jal, New Mexico in Lea County. The plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  The Jal #3 \n\nPlant has three (3) regulated processes:\n\n    \n\n1.    Propane storage tank (Propane)\n\n2.    Product surge tank (Propane, Ethane, and Butane) \n\n3.    Natural gas condensate storage tank"

These two toxics are addressed in our facility emergency action plan. In addition, the hydrogen sulfide gas is covered under the New Mexico Rule 118, of which we comply, that deals with the protection of the general public.  This facility does not have a threshold planning quantity of any toxic; therefore, a worst-case scenario (WCS) for a toxic release was not evaluated.  \n\n\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product storage tank containing a mixture of ethane, propane and butane.  \n\n    \n\nThe maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.60 mile(s).   The WCS for the other two regulated processes would result in a 1psi endpoint of 0.40 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. There are only Program Level 1 processes, containing regulated flammable substances, identified at our gas plant. \n\n    \n\nThe Jal #3 gas plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. This includes names and telephone numbers of contact persons for Sid Richardson, for surrounding public receptors, for emergency responders, and for affected agencies.  The Jal #3 gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability and staff.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency a"
