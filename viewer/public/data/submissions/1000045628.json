The CO2 is piped to a local plant that bottles the gas and makes dry ice.  The SNG is distributed throughout the City of Honolulu and a number of surrounding communities.  System components include boilers, compressors, condensers, reactors, accumulators, piping and valves, instrumentation and controls and other miscellaneous components.\r\n\r\nNaphtha and its components are highly flammable and stored as a pressurized liquid in 5 horizontal storage tanks.  The tanks are protected by a water deluge system as well as fixed hydrants and monitors.  The process plant is located a considerable distance away from the storage area and it is unlikely that a fire in the process would involve the storage vessels.  The vessels are connected to the process by piping and therefore the process facility has been included in the RMP.  The primary hazard of the stored products and the process facility is the risk of explosion or fire.  The butane and other feed components are not considered acutely toxic material, although it could cause asphyxiation in large quantities.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe SNG Plant has integrated program elements described in the RMP to deal with the risks involved with the storage and handling of naphtha and other flammable materials throughout the manufacturing process. In this way, we promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  These program elements include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information : The facility has been designed and installed by reputable vendors who are well known in the industry.  We require that information on the design and operation of the facility be documented and maintained for as long as we operate it.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis : Our processes involving flammables have been thoroughly analyzed for unseen hazards using techniques that are common in process i"

Hazard analyses generate items that potentially could pose a risk to operations,  or could reduce risk or improve operability.  The hazard analysis findings are analyzed to determine if a change to the facility would be beneficial.  Items are addressed on a priority basis based upon safety and feasibility.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures : Formal written operating procedures for operation and maintenance of our facility have been developed.  Procedures provide steps for each operating phase; they also document operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\r\n\r\nTraining : The Gas Company has a very experienced workforce.  The average experience of operations is 16 years.  The Gas Company certifies that their operators are competent.  We ensure that newly hired employees are proficient at safely carrying out their duties and responsibilities before assigning them to critical tasks. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity : Preventive maintenance practices have been in place since the facility was constructed in 1974.  We perform routine safety checks, inspections, and preventive maintenance tasks to reduce the likelihood and severity of equipment failures.  Outside experts, including pressure vessel and piping inspectors are employed as needed to provide ongoing verification of the integrity of the system.  Hot work procedures, Lockout/Tagout procedures and others are used to document and control safe work practices.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change : Changes to the process, including chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures and changes to equipment that could affect the process or storage of flammables are managed through use of a written management of change procedures.

The facility operates under strict federal and state regulations for safety of its employees, its products and the environment.  By maintaining a comprehensive safety program and documenting the program in this Risk Management Plan, The Gas Company is complying with HIOSH and OSHA Process Safety Management Standards (called PSM) and EPAA\u00bfs Risk Management Program regulations (called RMP).\r\n\r\nThe Gas Plant has been safely operating since 1974.  At The Gas Company, we realize that constant diligence in operation and proper maintenance of our facility can reduce risks to our workers and to the public.  This RMP documents the procedures and controls in place to ensure that accidental releases of flammable materials are prevented and to promptly respond to and mitigate any incident that does occur.\r\n\r\nOur RMP and PSM programs are applied to all onsite activities that could involve or affect the facility.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern individual processes, activities or pieces of equipment.  These rules are periodically reviewed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nA mixture of flammable liquids and gases called naphtha is transferred by pipeline from an adjacent refinery and stored in pressure vessels.  The mixture is largely butane gas, pentane and hexane liquids and other light hydrocarbons.  A total storage capacity of 600,000 lb. is stored in 5 pressure vessels.  The naphtha is then pumped into the process facility, which uses a series of catalytic reactions to manufacture synthetic natural gas (called SNG).  The processes utilize catalysts in fixed beds and in tubes.  Catalysts are solid materials t"

An Incident Investigation Committee has been formed consisting of the site ESH officer, a member of the corporate ESH department, a member of the maintenance department and an operator.  \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation : We actively encourage and require our employees to participate in program development and enforcement.  We have a documented system that verifies employee participation in each program element.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit : Before work is performed which involves a potential source of ignition, designated personnel must inspect the work area, review the procedures and document precautions necessary to prevent fires or explosions.  The written permit authorizes work on specific dates and on specific equipment.\r\n\r\nContractors : The Gas Company has a program in place to collect safety program and performance information from its contractors and evaluate the contractorsA\u00bf suitability.
