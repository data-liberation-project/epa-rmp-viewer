      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:  The City of DuBois Wastewater Treatment Facility is\nlocated just outside of the City limits in the neighboring community of Sandy \nTownship.  The plant treats approximately three million (3,000,000) gallons of \nsewage per day.  The treated sewage is disinfected with chlorine prior to \ndischarge.\n\nThe facility's approach to chemical safety includes training of facility personnel \nin proper handling techniques of toxic chemicals to lessen the risk of accidental \nreleases and the facility is also equipped with a two (2) ton chlorine emergency \nrepair kit.  Another approach is to maintain two (2), two thousand (2,000) gallon \ntanks of chlorine at the facility at any given time.  One (1) tank will be in use \nwhile maintaining the other tank in storage.\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas and hazardous chemical and the threshold amount of \nchlorine for preparing a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is two thousand (2,000) \npounds per one process.  The treatment plant has a maximum of four thousand \n(4,000) pounds of chlorine at the site.  However, there is only one covered process \nthat contains a maximum of two thousand (2,000) pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe covered process involves the use of one (1), two thousand (2,000) pound \ncylinder to disinfect treated sewage and the storage of one (1), two thousand \n(2,000) pound cylinder of chlorine.  Both cylinders are located inside the chlorine \nbuilding on racks.  The chlorine building is equipped with the proper ventilation, \nalarms, and safety measures.  Since, the two cylinders are stored in close \nproximity to each other, they are considered only one process.  The maximum \namount of chlorine stored in this process is four thousand (4,000) pounds.  Since \nit is more than the two thousand five hundred (2,500) pounds allowed, it is a \ncovered process.\n\nBecause there is one covered process, the worst-case scenario and an alternative \nscenario were analyzed for potential off-site impacts involving the public sector.  \nThe worst-ca"

The analysis utilizing the EPA's RMP Com Computer \ncomputations assumes that under stable atmospheric conditions the gases would \ncarry the farthest.  Based on this analysis, the off-site impacts to the four thousand \n(4,000) pounds of chlorine being released during the ten-minute period would \nrange 1.9 miles from the treatment plant.  The estimated population affected \nwould be approximately thirteen thousand (13,000) individuals.  The likelihood of \nthe worst-case scenario becoming reality is remote considering the following \nfactor: that with only one (1) cylinder in storage, that cylinder is only moved \nwhen the other cylinder is empty and is moved by a mechanical hoist system.  \nShould the one cylinder rupture due to falling from the hoist, the second cylinder, \nwhich is empty, would not be affected.\n\nThe alternate release analysis is a more realistic assumption of a potential gas \nhazard occurring.  The most likely release would be the rupture of one tank by \nsome outside force.  This analysis assumes that two thousand (2,000) pounds of \nchlorine is released in a thirteen (13) minute period.  It assumes that the \natmosphere is not as stable and the gas would dissipate at a faster rate.  By \nutilizing the EPA's RMP Comp Computer Model, it is estimated that the off-site \nimpacts would range within a 0.3 miles from the treatment plant.  A release of this \ntype is estimated to affect approximately ninety-five (95) households and two \nhundred thirty-five (235) individuals.\n\nTo avoid accidents from occurring, the personnel are trained in proper procedures \nfor moving cylinders.  The method for moving the cylinders is an automatic hoist \nsystem and several safety procedures are performed during the moving process:\n\n1.
