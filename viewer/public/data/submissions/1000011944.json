Brenntag's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb. This RMP has been prepared to address the handling of the following federal Regulated Substances at its facility located at 10747 Patterson PLace, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670:\n\n -  Hydrofluoric Acid\n -  Ammonia solution\n\nc. Brenntag has a comprehensive release prevention program meeting RMP and PSM requirements. Physical safeguards to prevent a release include the installation of remotely actuated valves. Storage tanks and drum fillers are located within containment dikes designed to hold the entire contents of the largest tank. All transfer and filling operations follow strict and comprehensive written procedures. Operations are constantly attended. Equipment, instrumentation and piping (including transfer hoses) are subject to rigorous inspection and preventative maintenance policies and procedures.\n\nd. There have been no accidents to report under the Five-year Accident History component of the RMP.\n\ne. Brenntag has a well-manned and well-equipped Hazmat Emergency Response Team which can respond quickly yet safely to spills and other incidents. All team members are trained and certified in accordance with federal/Cal-OSHA Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response requirements by the California Specialized Training Institute (CSTI). Brenntag coordinates with the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department (SFSFD) in order to be able to respond jointly to hazardous materials emergencies. \n\nf. This is a relatively new state-of-the art facility. Numerous safety features including detection systems, emergency shutdown systems and deluge systems were incorporated into the design of the fac"
