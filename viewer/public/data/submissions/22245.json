      "SummaryText": "1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Stolthaven Houston Inc., we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes involved in chemical storage and handling in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n? A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n? An overview of our emergency response program\n? An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n? The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n? The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility stores (Acrylonitrile, Epichlorohydrin, Isopropanolamine, Vinyl Acetate Monomer and Toluene-diisocyanate) using large above ground storage tanks.  The facility does not perform any RMP chemical processing operations.  These chemicals have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\n\nAcrylonitrile (CAS # 107-13-1), Epichlorohydrin (CAS # 106-89-8), Vinyl Acetate Monomer (CAS # 108-05-4), and Toluene-diisocyanate (CAS # 584-84-9)\n\nFlammables:\n\nIsopropylamine (CAS # 75-31-0)\n\n\nOur accidental release p"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe facility worst-case scenario is for Acrylonitrile.  The quantity is 14,116,284 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of the largest storage tank.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.  Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.  Additionally the LEPC is provided information for administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for this scenario.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe facility alternate case scenario(s) are for Acrylonitrile (toxic).  The toxic quantity is 1,000 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of a loading hose.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.  Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.  Additionally the LEPC is provided information for administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for this scenario(s).\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chem"

The flammable quantity is 3,780,000 pounds and is the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of a storage tank.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method. Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.  Additionally the LEPC is provided information for administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for this scenario(s).\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe facility alternate case scenario(s) is for Isopropylamine (flammable).   The flammable quantity is also 1,000 pounds and is also the entire amount that could be lost due to a catastrophic failure of a loading hose.  The worst-case weather conditions are assumed, and the maximum estimated exposure distance is then computed by the EPA method.  Then a list of the potentially impacted receptors is generated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) is provided the information.

Our management systems addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n? Process Safety Information\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n? Operating Procedures\n? Training\n? Mechanical Integrity\n? Spill C"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n5.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five (5) years:\n\nThere have been no accidental chemical releases of covered substances during the past five (5) years.\n\nIf there had been an incident, then we would have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause(s) of the event(s).\n\n\n6.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).\n\n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we have recently completed and/or implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n?
