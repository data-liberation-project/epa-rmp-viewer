The compression was brought on-line in January 2000.  The process was brought on line March 2000. The facility is manned 10 hours daily. \n\nLow pressure inlet gas from CNR\u00bfs Natural Gas gathering system is delivered to the plant via a 10\u00bf pipeline between 25-45 psig.  The gas is compressed by two identical electric drive reciprocating gas compressors to process pressure of approximately 900 psig.  The gas is dehydrated using Tri-ethylene Glycol (TEG) and Molecular Sieve prior to entering the liquid extractions portion of the process.  The TEG system produces an effluent stream (primarily water) that is pumped to a slop vessel. \n\nThe nature of the plant is gas expansion from a higher pressure to a lower pressure, thereby cooling the gas to extract hydrocarbon liquids and making the resulting residue gas merchantable The plant is designed to operate in the de-ethanizing mode. Overhead vapors (residue gas) from the de-ethanizer with a volume of 7.5 MMscfd and composition of 76% Methane and 15% Ethane are recompressed to 1150 psig and delivered to the Columbia Gas Transmission Pipeline.  Liquids leaving the bottom of the de-ethanizer flow to the fractionation system. \n\nDepropanizer and Debutanizer fractionation systems are provided at HGP.  The facility produces a approximately 1200-1500 gallons a day of Propane product with a composition of 10% Ethane and 75% Propane.  The balance of the product stream is composed of heavy ends.\n\nThe facility produces approximately 3000 gallons a day of a Butanes plus (Propane/Butane mix) product stream with a composition of  21% Propane, 41% Butane and 20% Pentane.  The balance of the fluid mix are heavy ends commonly known as C6 plus (Hexane, Heptane, Octane and"

The interconnecting piping would make the refrigeration plant part of the \"process\" but the requirements would not change in relation to distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi or resulting RMP Program level.\n\nThere are five (5) 30,000 gallon pressurized \u00bfbullet\u00bf type storage vessels on location.  \n\nTwo (2) of the storage vessels are used primarily for propane storage.  One vessel is produced into daily.  When the vessel is full @ 85% the vessels are switched.  The full vessel is vented back into the process to reduce the ethane content before being trucked from the facility.\n\nOne (1) vessel is used for Butanes Plus (Propane-Butane mix) storage.  This vessel is shipped by truck as soon as a load (9,500 gallons) is produced.  Though this vessel is procedurally held at approximately 33%, at 3,000 gallons production a day, if transportation were unavailable, the vessel could fill to 88% maximum in 5.5 days.  Consequently, the vessel was evaluated as being full.\n\nOne (1) vessel is used as a slop vessel.  As discussed above, the effluent stream from the TEG dehydrator is pumped to this vessel.  Additional fluids from the various vessels are dumped in the vessel.  The normal content of this vessel is 98% water. This fluid is transported by truck to an offsite disposal facility.\n\nOne (1) vessel remains in standby mode.  This vessel can be used for either Propane or Butane storage if for some reason (weather) transportation was unavailable for shipping the product. Procedurally, this vessel is used only as standby and as such was not evaluated for RMP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nWe used RMP*Comp\u00bf and two composition scenarios to determine worst case scen"
