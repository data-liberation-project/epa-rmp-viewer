Huntsman Sour Lake Olefins Facility (SLOF) is committed to achieving excellence in environmental, health and safety.  The Huntsman SLOF implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals, and conforms to the Texas Railroad Commission requirements.  Huntsman SLOF participates with the Hardin County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies. Huntsman participates in the Responsible Care. initiative at the Chemical Manufacturer's Association and is committed to the responsible management of chemicals. The Plant Manager of the SLOF is responsible for implementation of the risk management program (RMP) at the SLOF.\n\n2.    Regulated Substances. The Sour Lake Olefins Facility (SLOF) is located in Sour Lake, Texas, just off of Shoestring Road.  The site stores olefins, namely, ethylene and propylene.  These products are stored in underground salt dome caverns and processed to remove water. \n\nThe two (2) flammable regulated substances are:\n\n7 Ethylene - Product used to manufacture polyethylene grocery bags, wraps and machine parts, and as a raw material for other ethylene based products (ethylene glycol-antifreeze, ethanol amines-shaving creams, hand lotions, furniture polishes, and dry-cleaning preparations, etc.)\n7 Propylene - Product used to manufacture polypropylene materials such  films, clothesline and other kinds of rope and, in turn, is used as a raw material for other propylene based materials (propylene glycol-factory fill antifreeze and propylene oxide).\n \n3.

This OCA includes the development of worst and alternative release scenarios for the release of toxic and flammable substances.  There are no regulated toxic substances at the SLOF.  The OCA allows for the consideration of administrative controls in estimating potential scenario impacts.  EPA's computer program, RMP Comp, Ver. 1.06, was used to model the release scenarios\n\nFlammable Release Scenarios  \n    \n    The Flammable Worst Case Scenario is based on EPA required assumption and is highly unlikely and has never occurred at this facility.\n\n    The flammable worst case scenario involves the rupture of piping downstream of the casing releasing propylene out of the salt cavern for 10 minutes.  The volume released is assumed to vaporize and result in a vapor cloud explosion.  This  scenario has an offsite impact. The representative flammable alternative release scenario is a release from a 3/4\" pipe for 10 minutes, and also has an offsite impact.   A rigorous inspection program complying with industry codes and standards, effective operator and maintenance training using procedures consistent with safe operation, and adherence to the Process Safety Management reduce the risk of a flammable substance release.\n\n    Specific measures preventing these scenarios include pressure monitors and alarms, fast acting isolation valves, area and perimeter monitors, flame detectors, fixed fire water monitors, and operating procedures.\n    \n4.   General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's SLOF has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) and Texas Natur"

This includes information pertaining to: \n7 Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n7 The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n7 Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n\n7 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n         Huntsman's SLOF has performed process hazard analysis (PHA) on each process to identify the potential hazards, the adequacy of the engineering and administrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards.  The SLOF utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  Employees are assigned to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  Hurricanes and inclement weather are not investigated in the PHAs; however, Huntsman does have a Hurricane Procedure and implements this procedure under the threat of a hurricane and inclement weather.\n \n7 Operating Procedures\n         Huntsman SLOF maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.

The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.  \n \n7 Mechanical Integrity\n         Huntsman SLOF has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \n7 Management of Change\n         Huntsman SLOF has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered:  the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any  modification to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.

Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.  \n \n7 Incident Investigation\n         Huntsman SLOF investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman SLOF has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.
