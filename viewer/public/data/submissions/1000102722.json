During these exercises, Bakelite involves as many associates as possible within a single or multiple exercises and works to involve an outside emergency agency, if possible. An update to the EAP is conducted as soon as possible when there is a change to assigned people or other key aspects of the plan. Emergency response training and annual refresher training for personnel regarding the EAP is conducted at the facility.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nBakelite Synthetics Americas region is undergoing an organizational structure change that will provide more support to the Acme facility. This additional support should improve safety across all the America facilities including the Acme facility."

Contractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are prescreened prior to selection for work on-site. This prescreening review evaluates their safety programs and performance for any job that could impact process safety. Once selected, contractors are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Incidents that cause, or could cause, a release are investigated with recommendations leading to improvements to help prevent recurrence. These recommendations include improvement of equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training. Periodically, a safety professional from another Bakelite location conducts a comprehensive audit of the safety program. Addressing recommendations from this audit keeps the safety program effective.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History:\n\nBakelite has not had an off-site release of regulated substance during the five year period from October 12, 2017 to October 7, 2022. \n\n5.\tEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that discusses the steps to respond or evacuate in the event an accidental release occurs.

Recommendations resulting from the PHAs are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion with multiple methods used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. All equipment and procedure changes initiates a safety review under the Management of Change (MOC) process. The MOC review process includes a PHA as needed for significant changes to the facility. Product formulations changes initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and the site leader. Training is provided to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact to the facility. Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change is made. A preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment using a computer database to manage the preventive maintenance schedule. Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or equipment servicing is performed. The schedule is based on American Petroleum Institute (API) inspection frequency Standards 510 and 653, plant experience, and manufacturer recommendations to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure. \n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices to prevent accidental releases. One critical aspect of the manual is the facility permitting process for the control of hazards during work activities. This safe work practice permitting process includes activities such as confined space entry, lockout tagout, and hot work. These safe work practices apply both to employees and contractors. For specific activities, the Safety Manual contains sections to describe safety measures. One example is permitting of welding or other hot work activities to reduce the risk"

Anhydrous ammonia is a raw material also used is the manufacturing of hexamine and is received via railcars. Aqua ammonia is manufactured on-site for supplying customers. Hexamine is formed by reacting formaldehyde and ammonia. This unit includes a reactor, evaporator, crystallizers, and a dryer. Bakelite can sell the hexamine in liquid solution or it can be dried through a crystallizer process. The max quantity on-site for anhydrous ammonia is 444,032 pounds and aqueous ammonia is 72,708 pounds. The plant also includes raw material handling and storage operations, utility operations (including steam production), and finished product loadout activities.\n\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility has a Process Safety Management Program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention rule, OSHA Process Safety Management rule, and all applicable state codes and regulations. A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance which includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly safety committee meeting where a management control check sheet is used to verify tasks completed on schedule. Bakelite\u0092s Site Leader has overall responsibility for this program and is responsible for keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators on these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents. All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation. The Site Leader maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.
