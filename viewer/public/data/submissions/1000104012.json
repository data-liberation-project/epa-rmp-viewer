The PHA study provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  The PSM team is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSafeway is dedicated to operation of a safe facility for its employees and neighboring community. A safety committee has been established that is responsible for the implementation of the safety program and an Emergency Response Plan. This includes safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Safeway has prepared risk and safety programs to ensure safe handling of the ammonia in the refrigeration system. Recently Safeway Inc. conducted a Process Hazard Analysis to identify potential hazards and the appropriate mitigation measures.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n1. The Safeway facility is located at 2434 East Pecan Road in Phoenix, Arizona. Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) is used as the refrigerant. The total quantity of ammonia was calculated to be 40,400 pounds.\n\n2. The Safeway ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of piping, valves and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n3. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 16\u0094Hg on the low-pressure side to 185 psig on the high side.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSafeway has an accidental release prevention program in place that complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standa"
