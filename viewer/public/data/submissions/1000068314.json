PES Charleston, TN facility\u0092s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bradley County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Our neighbor and hydrogen supplier, Olin Chemical, maintains an emergency response team on site trained and equipped to handle small emergencies.  PES employees are provided annual training on the use of portable fire extinguishers and the fixed fire monitors.\n\nThe Charleston facility accepts hydrogen pumped from the neighboring Olin Chemical Chlor-Alkali plant.   The hydrogen is liquified and transported to customers in cargo tanks.  \tThe main process components for liquid hydrogen production are:\n\u0095\tHydrogen buffer tank\n\u0095\tHydrogen liquefier with recycle compressors.\n\u0095\tHelium liquid storage tank and compressors (2)\n\u0095\tNitrogen re-liquefier with liquid storage and recycle compressor.\n\u0095\tLiquid hydrogen storage tank & offloading\n\u0095\tCooling tower and pump system\n\u0095\tUtilities such as instrument air and nitrogen\n\nCharleston uses a hydrogen liquefaction system consisting of a series of multi-pass heat exchangers enclosed in a perlite-insulated cold box and a vacuum-insulated cold box. Hydrogen is cooled and liquified for storage at a temperature of -421\u00b0F and 5 psig via heat exchange with nitrogen and helium compression and expansion cycles. A series of Ortho-Para conversion reactors are included in the liquefier system to achieve a concentration of approximately 95% para-hydrogen and 5% ortho-hydrogen, which will minimize boil-off of product hydrogen.\n\nLiquid hydrogen is stored in two (2) 60,000-gallon horizontal storage tanks. The tanks are vacuum jacketed and include a boil-off vapor collection system. Product hydrogen will be loaded into tanker trucks via loading bays"

      "SummaryText": "present at the site.\n\n2.2.4\tHydrogen storage tanks are constructed with the liquid hydrogen tank suspended in a vacuum casing.  There is an evacuation valve on the tank.\n\u0095\tThe liquid tank is wrapped with insulation material.  \n\u0095\tThe space between the liquid tank and the casing (outer shell) is evacuated (vacuum), filled with an adsorbent (perlite) to help maintain a vacuum, and sealed.\n\u0095\tGas and liquid hydrogen piping pass through the ends of the casing. \n\u0095\tThe casing is protected from over pressurization with a rupture disk in the event of a leak from the liquid container into the annular space.\n\u0095\tThe inner liquid container is protected by dual relief valves and a rupture disk.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe bulk liquid gas storage tanks are monitored by various methods:  overfill alarms that provides the liquid weight in the tank, and hand gauged.  All tanks during loading are manually checked every 30 minutes, which prevents the overfilling of tanks.  When tanks are to be filled to or near capacity, a loader is stationed at the tank during top-off. \n\nPlug Power Charleston facility pipelines are supported on pipe standards to permit visual inspection for leaks and corrosion.  The pipe standards are designed to minimize abrasion and corrosion, as well as for expansion and contraction.  Personnel are to notify the Plant Manager and implement the plant emergency procedures, if necessary, for the release of that type of material.\n\nCargo tank loading procedures used, meet the minimum requirements and regulations established by the Department of Transportation (DOT) 49 CFR 174 Subpart B \u0093Loading of Tank Trucks;\u0094 and Part 156, Subpart A \u0093Oil and Hazardous Material Transfer Operations.\u0094\n\nDetailed prevention program is described in the PES Charleston, TN Process Safety Program and the PES Maintenance Preventive Maintenance program."
