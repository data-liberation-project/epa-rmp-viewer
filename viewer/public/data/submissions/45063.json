Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of FS Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accident release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with Marshfield Fire Department, Wood County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 2510 21st Street, is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and handling system consists of 1-18,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 132,000 pounds; this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by the state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety an Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?. Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our accident release prevention program.\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor \n-    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, e"
