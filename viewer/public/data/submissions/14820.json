The purpose of this plan is to reduce accidental releases of hazardous materials in order to protect the community, on-site personnel, and the environment.\n\nThe Executive Summary provides an overview of the site's comprehensive risk management activities, including:\n\n7 Company overview\n7 Facility overview\n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n7 Regulated substances\n7 Worst-case release scenarios\n7 Alternative release scenarios\n7 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n7 Accident prevention measures\n7 Five-year accident history\n7 Emergency Planning and Response Program\n7 Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nDow Corning Corporation was founded in 1943 as a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Glass Works. Dow Corning is the world leader in the development and manufacture of silicone based products, including fluids, emulsions, rubbers, solids, and greases.\n\nDow Cornings first commercial product was DC4 Compound, a paste applied to the electrical systems of World War II aircraft to prevent corona discharge during high altitude flight. Today, the companys products include silicones, related specialty chemicals, semiconductor grade silicon, and specialty health care products.\n\nDow Corning is a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association and subscribes to the Responsible Care. Codes of Management Practices.\n\n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW\n\nThe Carrollton, Kentucky site manufactures chlorosilanes, methyl chloride, and silicone products in a series of batch and continuous processing steps. These steps include grinding, chemical reaction, purification, and polymerization. The site has two manufacturing units, Carrollton 1 and 2. Carrollton I began operating in December 1966 and has undergone a series of expansions, and Carrollton II started up in 1991. It is now the largest silicone producti"

The majority of these substances is shipped to customers or other Dow Corning facilities.\n7 Dimethyldichlorosilane is the primary chlorosilane intermediate manufactured on-site. The majority of this substance is used to manufacture silicone products.\n7 Tetramethylsilane and trichlorosilane are silane intermediates manufactured and used on-site. These substances exist in mixtures only.   \n7 Hydrogen and chlorine are purchased and used on-site; however, the quantities are below the RMP threshold quantities.\n\nNon RMP regulated substances used on-site include silicon, methanol, sulfuric acid, heptane, catalysts, and processing aids.
