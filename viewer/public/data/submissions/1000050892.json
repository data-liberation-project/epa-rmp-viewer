The wastewater treatment plant processes an average of 8.5 million gallons of wastewater per day.  Our primary method of disinfection is accomplished by use of chlorine.  The treatment plant utilizes 2000-pound steel cylinders.  We have no more than 12,000 pounds of chlorine on site at one time during the May to November season.   During a 2002 facility upgrade, a chlorine scrubber system was installed.  \n\n\n\nIn summer of 2015 we completed an audit of our processes, programs, procedures, and training, and have updated our RMP accordingly.  All training and procedural updates will be completed by 8/31/15.\n\n\n\nAs of the recent OEPA audit, an error was found in section 2-the estimated population with distance to end point. It has been corrected.\n\n"
