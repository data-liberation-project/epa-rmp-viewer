The regulated substance that is the subject of this RMP is the anyhydrouos ammonia contained in the facility's ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP regulations promulgated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the facility determined in June 1999 that its worst-case release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration system would be the loss of the contents of its largest liquid ammonia containing vessel, which is a 2,141 gallon high pressure receiver located in the processing plant.  Under normal operating conditions, this receiver contains a liquid level of aproximately 20%.  However, during pump-downs, which occur approximately 0-2 times per year for system maintenance and repair, the high-pressure receiver can hold up to 80% liquid, an amount this is limited by administrative controls.  Using the parameters set forth in the RMP regulations, and using an atmospheric dispersion modeling program made available by EPA, the worst-case release would travel to a toxic endpoint offsite and potentially reach nearby receptors.  The worst-case release scenario takes into account that the release would occur in an enclosed space that is in direct contact with the outside air, but assume that no active mitigation measures are taken.  As of June 2004, this worst case release scenario remains the same because the aforementioned receiver remains as the largest liquid containing vessel.\n\nGeorge's Chicken's al"

Under normal operating conditions and average weather conditions, and for the rural topography where the facility is located, the predicted endpoint is 0.2 miles.  There are public recpetors located within the distance to toxic endpoint which could be affected by a release.  These calculations are based on formulas and atmospheric dipserson modeling tables and graphs contained in a model risk management program and plan for ammonia refrigeration which was made available by EPA.  The alternative release scenario takes into account that the relase would occur in an enclosed space that is in direct contact with the outside air, but assumes that no active mitigation measures are taken.  This alternative scenario is the same as the one used by the facility in June 1999, nothing having changed since that date that would lead the facility to believe that another scenario is more likely to occur (i.e., there have been no actual releases in the last five years).\n\nIn accordance with the RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components:  process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up review procedures for significant system modifications, procedure for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of employees and has been periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facil"

Chemical-specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\n\nIn the five (5) years preceding development of this RMP in June 1999, this facility did not have any accidental releases of ammonia which resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, nor which resulted in any known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The same holds true for the five (5) years after the development of the RMP.\n\nThe facility has in place an emergency response program to address accidental releases of ammonia.  The ermgency response program consists of a Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Team which operates pursuant to an emergency response plan developed under the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Regulations.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local emergency responders, including fire departments, rescue squads, and the Local Emergency Planning Commissioner (LEPC).  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan.  If necessary, regional HazMatTeams are available to assist the facility in responding to any accidental release of ammonia.\n\nA process hazard analysis report was initially prepared for the facility in January 1998.  All recommended actions were completed or otherwise addressed.  Recommendations from subsequent process hazard analysis reports have also been completed or otherwise addressed.
