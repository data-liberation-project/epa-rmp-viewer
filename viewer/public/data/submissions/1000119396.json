These personnel also receive initial training and annual update training thereafter.   \n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Williams Country Sausage ERP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWilliams Country Sausage's aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."

This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the local Fire Department, and the Obion County Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The systemA\u00bfs purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our dairy product.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as conversed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres EJScreen was utilized exclusively. The EJScreen model is referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process. \n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculate"

The Williams Country Sausage is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\nThe Williams Country Sausage Emergency Action and Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, firs-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action and Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nWilliams Country Sausage has devised a comprehensive emergency action and response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY ACTION & RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Williams Country Sausage. as well as measures to be taken by off-site re"
