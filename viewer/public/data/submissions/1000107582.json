The Emergency Response Program includes having a trained, on-site Hazardous Material Response Team available to respond to releases. OPPD also coordinates emergency response planning with the Otoe County Emergency Response Agency.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThere have not been any accidents, as defined in 40 CFR 68.42, in the past five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nOPPD is continually looking for ways to improve the safety of the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. During the Spring 2023 outage, the ammonia system relief valve piping was extended by 5 feet and the quick disconnect shutoff valve was replaced. Also, a relief valve and piping was added in preparation for the addition of two \u201cV\u201d Ring Seal Globe valves to the unloading skids. The valves will be installed between the unloading hose connection point and the cable activated shut off valves to shorten the amount of piping from 4 feet to a few inches. That will reduce the amount of liquid ammonia that could be stored in the piping between deliveries. Other planned work for the near future includes upgrading temperature switches and replacing the current ammonia detectors with a new model with more readily available replacement parts."

Refresher training is provided at least once every three years. Operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of the process after a change. All employees, contractors, vendors, and un-escorted visitors at Nebraska City Station are required to take ammonia awareness training.\n\nMaintenance: Procedures are in place for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Employees that perform maintenance on the equipment are trained. Inspections and testing are conducted consistent with good engineering practices and/or manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nCompliance Audits: A compliance audit was completed on September 11, 2023. The certified audit evaluated compliance with the RMP requirements to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed. A report of the audit findings was produced and includes a response to each finding and sets a timeframe by which the corrective actions will be completed. The completion of the corrective actions will be documented. The next compliance audit will be conducted in 2026.\n\nIncident Investigation: An Incident Investigation was conducted on August 28, 2019, for an incident involving a release of anhydrous ammonia. The changes resulting from the investigation were implemented by June 30, 2020.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\nOmaha Public Power District\u2019s (OPPD) Nebraska City Station is a coal-fired electric generating facility. It is located 5 miles south of Nebraska City in Otoe County, Nebraska. Nebraska City Station\u2019s Unit 2 uses anhydrous ammonia in the operation of its selective catalytic reduction (SCR) pollution prevention system. Anhydrous ammonia is the only Risk Management Program (RMP) listed chemical that is present at Nebraska City Station above the RMP threshold quantity. \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process at Nebraska City Station is classified as Program Level 2. The process is not eligible for Program Level 1 because the distance to a toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is greater than the distance to any public receptor (40 CFR 68.10(b)(2)). The anhydrous ammonia process is not Program Level 3 because the process has an NAICS code of 22112, fossil fuel electric power generation, which is not one of the ten NAICS codes listed in 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). The process is also not subject to the OSHA process safety management standard (40 CFR 68.10(b)(2)), because OPPD is a political subdivision of the State of Nebraska, and Nebraska does not have a state OSHA program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOPPD is committed to the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment.  The Risk Management Program at Nebraska City Station incorporates all of the required elements.\n\nSafety Information: Safety information is kept up-to-date and is easily accessible; the process was designed and is maintained in accordance with good engineering practices.\n\nHazard Review: The hazard review was conducted on December 17, 2020, with significant input from employees. The review identified hazards associated with the process, opportunities for equipment malfunction and /or human error, safeguards, and steps necessary to detect or monitor releases.
