The City of Great Falls Safety manual states that \"The City of Great Falls is committed to providing and ensuring a safe work environment for all employees, co-workers, and the public by conducting all operations as safely and efficiently as possible.  A comprehensive Safety and Loss Control Program can only be effective if everyone in the organization accepts their responsibility with accountability.\"  The Public Works Safety Committee meets monthly and is active in accident review and facility audits.\r\n\r\nThe Great Falls Water Treatment Plant works with the Great Falls Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee in preparing for emergency response.  This preparation includes annual reporting of hazardous chemicals, annual inspections by Fire Department personnel and occasional training for responses to major chlorine release events.  \r\n\r\nTHE WATER TREATMENT PLANT REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Great Falls Water Treatment Plant is a conventional surface water treatment plant.  Treatment processes include coagulation, settling, filtration and disinfection, with ammonia added after disinfection to prolong a disinfectant residual in the distribution system.  The primary chemicals involved in the process are aluminum sulfate (a liquid coagulant), chlorine gas (to provide disinfection) and ammonia gas.  Chlorine is the only substance at the treatment plant in sufficient quantity to require regulation.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant staff have developed a prevention program in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management program.  In addition, safety training resulting from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality's oversight of the facility operation have b"
