The plant, occupying approximately 6.3 acres, is a state-of-the art facility constructed in 1991, which uses an ammonia refrigeration system. The plant's vapor compression refrigeration system contains approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Columbus Foods acquired the plant in 2007 and has since made minor modifications to the refrigeration system.  The plant was previously owned and operated by Ito Cariani, Inc.  \n\nAccess to the manufacturing and office building is strictly controlled through locked doors and a security alarm system. The plant is located in the Eden Landing Industrial Park at the southeast corner of Corporate Avenue and Corporate Place.  The industrial park and surrounding area is used for light industrial manufacturing and commercial warehousing activities.  The Nimitz freeway (Highway 880) and the San Mateo Bridge are located approximately 1/2-mile from the facility.  The nearest body of water is the San Francisco Bay to the west.  Schools, hospitals and residences are located 1/4-mile to 1/2-mile east of the site.\n\nRegulated Substances and CalARP Program Levels\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) document has been prepared to satisfy Cal-ARP program requirements for the only covered process at the facility, the ammonia refrigeration system.

Therefore the facility is subject to the CalARP Program 3 requirements. The local administering agency (AA) for the CalARP Program is the HFD.\n\nProcess Description\nThis facility's primary refrigeration equipment consists of packaged plant components housed in a mechanical room.  The ancillary equipment includes piping, valves and evaporators located in drying rooms and storage rooms throughout the plant. The two-stage system is used to refrigerate several operations and areas at the plant.  Details of the mechanical compression refrigeration process are provided in the process flow diagrams (Appendix A) and in the main text of the report. The equipment includes a high pressure receiver, a low pressure receiver, five refrigeration compressors, an evaporative condenser, pumps, vessels, piping, control valves, pressure relief valves, regulators, control instrumentation, microprocessor-controller and alarms.  The condenser is located outside the building for heat rejection to the atmosphere. Part of the rejected heat is reclaimed through heat exchange with domestic hot water through a double-pipe heat exchanger (ammonia in inner pipe, water in outer pipe) located on the roof. The approximately 4,000-gallon high-pressure receiver is located outside the building on the southeast side (Figure 2).  Two 18,500-gallon emergency dump tanks with an ammonia diffuser system are located on the south side of the building.\n\nEngineering and Administrative Controls to Prevent Accidental Releases\nVarious engineering and administrative controls are in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The process can be manually shutdown using emergency switches located in the control room, compressor room and the front lobby.

Bracing installed in 1990-1991 was designed to UBC 1988.\n2.    Vapor/Gas Suppression and Containment:  The mechanical room has self-closing, tight fitting doors that open outward.  There are no openings from the mechanical room that will allow ammonia to escape to other parts of the building.  The exhaust system fans can be activated from emergency switches located inside and outside the mechanical room.  Exhaust has been provided for the mechanical room separately, therefore, should a leak occur ammonia will be restricted to the mechanical room preventing entry to the rest of the building.\n3.    Over or Under Pressure Controls:  If high pressure occurs a relief valve opens and ammonia is released at a predetermined safe rate (depending on device and vessel) until the pressure drops below the set point of the relief valve; the valve then reseals.\n4.    Over or Under Temperature:  High temperature will result in high pressure within the system.  Relief valves will then release the overpressure (see Over or Under Pressure Controls).  \n5.    Gas or Vapor Detection:  An automatic ammonia leak detection and alarm system provides continuous gas/vapor monitoring capability.  A total of fifteen ammonia detectors are installed monitoring all rooms containing refrigeration evaporators (see Figure 2 for locations).  In the event of a leak audible and visual alarms are actuated when ammonia concentration reaches 30 ppm to alert plant personnel and the security company.

The control system can shut down any system component or the entire system should temperature and/or pressure exceed system design.

Inventory Control: Ammonia will only be added to the system when required.  After initial charging this may be annual but recharging is not anticipated for two to three years.  Inventory control is provided by a gage at the high-pressure receiver.  This will be the only place that ammonia can be introduced into the system and it will be monitored by operators and the delivery truck operator when charging and recharging operations occur.\n15.

The affected area is represented as a circle of radius 1.2 miles (Figure 3).\n?    Using 2000 census data from Land View 6, the estimated residential population within the worst-case radius is approximately 12,500.\n?    According to Land View 6 census data, seven schools and one hospital are located within the worst-case circle at distances between 1/4-mile to 1.2-mile from the facility (Figure 3).  However upon checking with the Hayward Unified School District only six of the schools were found to exist. A list of these public receptors is presented as Table 3. Environmental receptors include the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (Land View 6).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n    The ARS for the ammonia refrigeration system is a release of ammonia to the atmosphere from operation of a relief valve or rupture disk failure on the high-pressure receiver.  It was estimated that approximately 10 percent of the charge would be lost (RMPP 1991) based on relief valves sized to code requirements.  However, to be conservative, it was assumed that 25 percent of the ammonia charge (3,000 pounds) would be released at a rate of 53.3 pounds per minute (relief valve capacity).  \n    \n    The results for the ARS were also generated using the EPA's RMP Comp?.

The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation. An estimated 20 pounds of ammonia were released on April 7, 2008 due to the operation of a relief valve.  The incident was reported to the HFD and the USEPA.  However, this release did not cause any offsite consequences as defined in the USEPA or CalARP regulations (evacuation, emergency response, injury or death).  The plant has not had any incidents that affected offsite receptors in the last 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nColumbus Foods has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that allows it to respond to any emergency.  The facility maintains a cooperative relationship with the HFD and relies upon the HFD for response to fires or hazardous materials emergencies. Plant personnel are trained in emergency evacuation. Designated employees will coordinate their efforts with the fire department, security company and ammonia plant vendors as necessary. Columbus Foods works closely with the HFD to prevent ammonia release or fires from occurring and to quickly mitigate either type of emergency.  Emergency evacuation drills will be conducted involving plant personnel and the HFD.  Mr. Hugh Murphy at (510) 583-4924 is Columbus Foods point of contact at the HFD.\n\nThe facility has a number of built in safeguards to prevent ammonia releases.
