Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Farmland Foods to provide a safe work environment for every employee, and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Farmland will also comply with all Federal, State, and local laws.  The General Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Farmland Foods takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe facility Environmental Coordinator is responsible for the overall management of the IRM-PSM ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nFarmland Foods produces pork products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool or freeze the food products and production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the facility is approximately 110,000 pounds.   Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Denison, IA facility. \n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Farmland Foods \u00bf Denison, IA facility has a program level 3 accidental release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Stand"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Farmland Foods \u00bf Denison, IA facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\n\n\nE. Description of Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Farmland Foods \u00bf Denison, IA facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n\u00b7 Fire Plan\n\u00b7 Ammonia Leak Procedures\n\u00b7 Evacuation Procedures\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeration system was analyzed May 17, 2005.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and have been implemented as required.  Our facility has also completed a Mechanical Integrity Study and we are waiting for the final report to plan further system maintenance."
