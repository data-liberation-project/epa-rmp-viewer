If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Ken Poeppe who is employed by West Bend Elevator.  Ken will decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed  which is 119,340 pounds.   This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 11,940 pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.   According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles.  There are an estimated 4,000 people within this radius.  Schools, residences, recreation areas, and major commercial, office or industrial areas are included in this radius.  Emmetsburg has 2 bullet tanks and 30 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  It is this facility's intention to comply EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is  maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Emmetsburg Fire Dept. and request that they"
