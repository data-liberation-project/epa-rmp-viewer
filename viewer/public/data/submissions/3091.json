If this were to occur, the \nvessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal \npressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long \nas the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an \nammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative-\nrelease scenario.  The SRVs are on a 5-year replacement schedule, in \ncompliance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \n(IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety \nCriteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will \nfunction properly when required.\n\nFurther, rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent \ncontact (e.g., vehicular) is unlikely since the unit is in an area that is not \naccessible to vehicles.\n\nIn addition, the worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following \nadditional reasons:\n\n?

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1\tSOURCE\nThe East Side Jersey Dairy is subject to the United Stated Environmental \nProtection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) for \nAccidental Chemical Release regulation (40 Code of Federal Regulations \n[CFR] 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the \nthreshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \n(Chemical Abstract System Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, \nmilk, juice, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains \napproximately 14,600 pounds (i.e., 2,400 gallons) of ammonia in various \nphysical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the \nhigh-pressure receiver that operates at approximately 170 pounds per \nsquare inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 9,500 pounds of \nliquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The receiver, condensing \ntowers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \npiping, and equipment.\n\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe East Side Jersey Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage \nsystem.  The high-pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (150 to \n180 psig) liquid ammonia to all of the cooling units, which includes:  \ncooler evaporators, freezer evaporators, large and small ice builders, \nglycol chiller, O.J. t"

Inadvertent vehicular contact with the vessel is unlikely since the unit \nis located in an area that is not accessible to vehicles.\n\n2.2\tALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE\nThe alternative, or more likely, scenario is considered to be defined by a \nrelease of ammonia through a 1?4-inch effective diameter hole in a high side \n(i.e., 150 psig) pipe or vessel, releasing 100 pounds of ammonia per minute \nfor up to 60 minutes.  This release is representative of a small pipe or \nvessel leak.  It would also be representative of a flange leak or pump seal \nfailure.  Because some piping is located outdoors, passive (building) \nmitigation  was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the \nendpoint.  Active mitigation  was considered, because it is believed that \nemergency responders could identify and stop the leak in less than 60 \nminutes.  However, the application of active mitigation does not change \nthe TEP distance obtained from the Model Plan.\n\nUsing the specified meteorology contained in the Model Plan, the distance \nto the endpoint for the more likely release scenario was estimated to be \n450 feet or 0.09 miles.\n\nThe alternat"

The freezer units \nreturn ammonia to accumulator #2.  All other units return ammonia to \naccumulators #1 and #3.  Ammonia vapor from accumulator #2 feeds two \nbooster compressors which compress the vapor to 30 psig and discharge \ninto accumulator #1.  Vapor from accumulators #1 and #3 is supplied to \nthe high-stage compressors.  Liquid ammonia is removed from the \naccumulators by high-pressure system gas and is returned to the high-\npressure liquid supply to the cooling units.\n\nThere are five high-stage compressors (i.e., four reciprocating compressors \nand one screw compressor).

Replacement of all pressure relief valves every 5 years.\n\n? The engine room is equipped with ammonia detectors to facilitate \nprompt identification and response in the event of a release of \nammonia.\n \n? Numerous safety systems including pressure relief valves, ammonia \nvessel level controls, and safety interlocks are used in the refrigeration \nsystem.\n \n? Periodic inspections are performed for major powered equipment, \nincluding compressors, large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, and \nmountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical failure.\n \n? Proper design including adherence to recognized safety codes.\n \n? Adherence to fire codes and preparation for fires, storms, or events \nwhich could impact the ammonia system.\n \n?

      "SummaryText": "ive release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n? Many of the high-pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas \nthat could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is \nelevated to promote dispersion;\n\n? Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of these lines;\n\n? Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n \n? Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork \nlifts;\n \n? The receiver is fitted with a manually operated valve (i.e., King valve) \nwhich can be closed to reduce the flow of liquid in an emergency;\n \n? The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain \nthe ongoing integrity of the system;\n \n? The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system \nis operated by qualified personnel; and\n \n? The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained \npersonnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by \nclosing valves in the liquid lines.\n\n3.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of \nammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release \nscenarios described in Section 2.0.  To help minimize the probability and \nseverity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, Process Safety Management \nof Highly Hazardous Chemicals standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been \nimplemented.  The key components of the prevention program are \nsummarized below:\n\n? The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical \nprocess safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the \ndesign basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is \nused to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration \nsystem.\n\n? The development of an employee participation program, which \nincludes employees from all levels of the organization and from all \nareas within the plant"

      "SummaryText": "rule requirements, two specifically defined \nrelease scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were \nanalyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the \nammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  This \nendpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below which \nnearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without \nexperiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could \nimpair their ability to take protective action.\n\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in \nthe USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration \n(the Model Plan), dated November 1998.  This guidance document used \nthe SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup \ntables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the \nendpoint distance.\n\n2.1\tWORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic \nrupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the high-pressure \nreceiver (approximately 9,500 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute \nperiod.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the \nModel Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was \nestimated to be 6,050 feet or 1.15 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it \nshould be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and \noperation of the high-pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is \nextremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict \naccordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) \nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and \nstamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National \nBoard).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's \ncondition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector \nwho has been certified by the National B"
