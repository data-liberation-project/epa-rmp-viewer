The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features: \n\nChlorine Dioxide: Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Courtland Mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution.  Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generators and piped to absorber columns, where a 1.1 wt. % chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing the substance as an aqueous solution greatly reduces the potential for a release.  A curbed area with sewers at the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.  Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring in all areas where the potential for chlorine dioxide exists, providing early detection, and helping to ensure a quick response in the event of a leak.  An emergency shutdown system is used to isolate the process if there is an upset or a release.\n\nChlorine: Chlorine is supplied to the Courtland Mill in DOT-approved 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is metered from a vacuum operated regulator/check valve attached directly to the cylinder through a short length of piping to an injector, where it is safely absorbed into process water.  This vacuum operated system provides a high degree of reliability and safety.  In the event of an unlikely failure in the piping downstream of the vacuum regulator/check valve, the valve will automatically close and shut off the flow of chlorine from the cylinder.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs.\n\nAs defined by the rule, three accidental releases have occurred in the past five years.  No permanent injury resulted from these accidents and information learned because of them was used to improve our prevention programs.  All appropriate local, "
