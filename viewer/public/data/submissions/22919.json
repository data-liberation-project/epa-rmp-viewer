As noted in the quote from U.S. EPA, the worst-case scenario represents the \"maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions\". \n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Pulp Bleaching process is a chlorine dioxide pipeline leak.  This scenario assumes that responders require 30 minutes to detect and repair the leak.  Mitigation measures considered in this scenario were emergency shutdown systems, chlorine dioxide monitors, directional curbing, sumps, drains, sewers, and scrubbers.  Based on average weather conditions at the site, the endpoint distance does not include residential population and reaches no environmental receptors with the exception of a small portion of a the Tennessee river.  The radius does extend offsite, but the offsite areas it covers are only the county road to the plant, a small portion of the river, and a small portion of a farmers field.\n \nThe alternative release scenario for the Water Intake chlorine processes is a gas valve failure on a 1-ton chlorine cylinder.  This scenario assumes that responders require 30 minutes to detect and repair the leak.

      "SummaryText": "International Paper (IP) owns and operates the Courtland Mill, an integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility, located on an 1860-acre site in north Alabama about 5 miles north of Courtland.  International Paper is committed to operating in a manner that provides for the safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment.  A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals.  Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental chemical release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain, and clean up the release.\n\nTwo substances, chlorine dioxide for pulp bleaching and chlorine for water treatment, are utilized at the site.

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features: \n\nChlorine Dioxide: Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Courtland Mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution.  Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generators and piped to absorber columns, where a 1.1 wt. % chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing the substance as an aqueous solution greatly reduces the potential for a release.  A curbed area with sewers at the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.  Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring in all areas where the potential for chlorine dioxide exists, providing early detection, and helping to ensure a quick response in the event of a leak.  An emergency shutdown system is used to isolate the process if there is an upset or a release.\n\nChlorine: Chlorine is supplied to the Courtland Mill in DOT-approved 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is metered from a vacuum operated regulator/check valve attached directly to the cylinder through a short length of piping to an injector, where it is safely absorbed into process water.  This vacuum operated system provides a high degree of reliability and safety.  In the event of an unlikely failure in the piping downstream of the vacuum regulator/check valve, the valve will automatically close and shut off the flow of chlorine from the cylinder.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs.\n\nAs defined by the rule, three accidental releases have occurred in the past five years.  No permanent injury resulted from these accidents and information learned because of them was used to improve our prevention programs.  All appropriate local,"
