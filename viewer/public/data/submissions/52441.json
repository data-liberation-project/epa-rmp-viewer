This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the local Avondale Fire Department and the Maricopa County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system\u00bfs purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Tolleson Dairy processing operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Tolleson Dairy is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process.\n\n \n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have be"

Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTolleson Dairy has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Tolleson Dairy has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n- Accident History\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the Tolleson Dairy facility within the last five years that have resulted in on, or off site property damage, injuries or deaths.\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\nTolleson Dairy current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nTolleson Dairy currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identify"
