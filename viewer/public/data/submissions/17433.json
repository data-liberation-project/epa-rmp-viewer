The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nSysco Food Services of San Francisco maintains Steering Committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Sysco Food Services of San Francisco ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1991.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 5900 Stewart Avenue, Fremont, California 94538.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 10,500 pounds of ammonia for dock operations, cold storage, and freezer storage.  Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  \n\nThe refrigeration system serves to maintain low temperatures for cold storage including warehouse and dock areas, and freezer storage.  The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR), where the pressure is reduced from"

It also supplies liquid ammonia to the cooler (16) and dock (5) evaporators and the High Temperature Suction Accumulator, which maintains a liquid/vapor mixture of ammonia at 28 psig.  As the liquid ammonia enters the various evaporator coils,it expands reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for the cooler and dock areas.  As the air is chilled by the cooler/dock evaporators, the ammonia is partially vaporized and returned to the High Temperature Suction Accumulator.\n\nThe High Temperature Suction Accumulator provides liquid ammonia for supply to the freezer evaporators (9), which return two-phased suction to the Low Temperature Suction Accumulator.  The Low Temperature Suction Accumulator further reduces the pressure of the ammonia to 1.3 psig.  The Booster Compressors (2) pull low pressure ammonia vapor from the Low Temperature Suction Accumulator and discharge higher pressure vapor back to the High Temperature Suction Accumulator.  The High Stage Compressors (2)pull the ammonia vapor (booster discharge) from the High Temperature Suction Accumulator and compress it, discharging high pressure ammonia vapor (hot gas) to the condenser. Hot gas is also used for defrost in the cooler and freezer evaporators and for pressurizing liquid transfer tanks associated with the accumulator vessels.  At the condenser, the ammonia is condensed to high pressure liquid and recycled to the High Pressure Receiver.  The system also has an emergency dump tank (into which a common relief header vents), which is kept full of water.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that is stored in the refrigeration system - 10,500 pounds in 10 minutes.  The largest vessel, controlled pressure receiver is located in an open engine room, therefore, no passive mitigation measures were u"

The facility is located in an urban setting.  The reference table 4-4 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, Nov 1998 was used to find the distance for the worst case release scenario to 200 ppm.  This potential scenario reaches off-site and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\n Scenario Description: A release of ammonia gas from a 1/4 inch diameter leak from orifice leading to an airborne release, representative of a pump seal leak, a gasket rupture, pinhole leak due to corrosion, flange seal leak, or valve bonnet seal leak.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 86 pounds per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were used due to the likely potential for an outside release.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The reference table 4-5 from the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, Nov 1998 was used to find the distance for the alternate release scenario to 200 ppm.  This potential scenario reaches off-site and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sysco Food Services of San Francisco facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.
