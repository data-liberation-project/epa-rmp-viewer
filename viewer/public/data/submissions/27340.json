Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Texoma Ag-Products, Inc. in Electra, Texas  are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\r\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\r\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\r\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We also\r\ncoordinate our response efforts with the Wichita County LEPC, which provides emergency response\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n  2.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Electra, Texas (Figure 1).  The maximum\r\namount stored is 80,000 pounds at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\r\n\r\n  3.   Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the single\r\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (80,000 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  We\r\nanticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate.  At Class F\r\natmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and an urban topography, the maximum distance to a toxic\r\nendpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 1.5 miles (Figure 2).  The 2000 Census thematic map indicated population\r\ndensity of 80 - 141 persons per 4"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 1.5 miles2 x\r\n3.14 x 141 people = approximately 996 people within 1.5 mile radius of the site. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\r\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\r\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\r\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of\r\n5,000 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\r\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\r\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.4 mile (Figure 3).  The 2000\r\nCensus thematic map indicated population density of 80 - 141 persons per .8 sq. miles (Figure 3). \r\nRadius2 x 3.14 = area of circle. 0.4 miles2 x 3.14 x 141 people = approximately 71 people within 0.4\r\nmile radius of the site.\r\n\r\n  4.   General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nTexoma Ag-Products, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\r\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\r\n(Appendix D).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled effectively.
