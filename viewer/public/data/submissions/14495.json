      "SummaryText": "\nA.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe emergency response procedures are detailed in the Sierra Pacific Refrigeration Services Emergency Response Plan and Procedures.  This manual was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1) To save lives.\n2) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3) To protect the environment.\n4) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan and Procedures provides the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  This manual is distributed to all plant personnel and is readily available at the facility. \n\nB.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment. \n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 5 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 125 psig on the high side. \n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 15,000 pounds.\n\nC.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nThe worst case release at this facility was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be st"

The vessel is located outside, therefore, no passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The facility is located in a rural setting. The SLAB dispersion model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm. The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nThe alternative release was that of a 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 6000 pounds.  This scenario represents a small leak that could occur at a valve connection, flange seal, or pump seal. The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability.  The facility is located in a rural setting. The SLAB dispersion model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm. The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nD.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIn addition, Sierra Pacific - Patterson has implemented a Process Safety M"

In addition, the facility has a Mechanical Integrity program that includes an \"Engineering Checklist\" for equipment inspections.\n\nE.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reported releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years (June 21, 1994 through June 21, 1999).\n\nF.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of a spill, release, near miss, or threatened release involving ammonia, the event will be reported to the supervisor in whose area the incident occurred.  The supervisor will in turn report to the Plant Manager and/or Chief Engineer.  The Plant Manager and/or Chief Engineer will immediately determine the quantity of the release and, if deemed necessary, notify the appropriate authorities and agencies. They will also determine the sections of the facility requiring evacuation, and notify all members of the Emergency Response Team (ERT), if not already present, to assist in the evacuation process.  They will also determine whether the system requires shut down.\n\nIf evacuation of the facility is necessary, plant personnel will vacate the facility according to evacuation routes outlined in Section 15 of the Sierra Pacific Emergency Response Plan and Procedures.  Emergency assembly area locations are to the north of the facility, and are discussed in the same section of the Emergency Response Plan and Procedures.  The ERT and area supervisors are the responsible parties for ensuring all employees are evacuated safely.  They are also responsible for ensuring all employees evacuate to the designated rendezvous point.\n\nNotification of evacuation will be provided in the form of an emergency whistle, or \"disaster alarm\".  Three (3) short blasts of the disaster alarm, followed by a pause, followed by three more short blasts will signify work area evacuation. The emergency response coordinat"

In the event the emergency coordinator is unavailable, a member from the ERT will become responsible for sounding the disaster alarm.\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the Chief Engineer will coordinate the containment process.  Designated team members will be present to assist the Chief Engineer in the containment process.  Designated team members will advise employees in the vicinity to evacuate the affected area(s).  If evacuation of the entire facility is necessary, designated team members will coordinate the movement of employees to the appropriate assembly area or rendezvous point.  Emergency response drills involving all facility personnel are performed on an annual basis.  This ensures that employees are familiar with evacuation routes from the facility.\n\nG.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere were several recommendations resulting from the development of the PSM/RMP document including recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis studies.  These Teams made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These recommendations are expected to be implemented by June 1999 and are listed as follows:\n\n\n1. Consider connecting a power failure alarm to the existing alarm system.\n\n2. Ensure recirculator pumps have manual reset capabilities after power failure.  Verify low level control on Recirculators are tied into liquid pumps.\n\n3. Install a check valve on the ammonia fill line.\n\n4. Document normal as well as abnormal (isolating equipment, plant tie-ins, etc.) operating procedures for the refrigeration system.\n\n5. Consider inviting the local Fire Department to the facility evacuation drill.\n\n6. Consider installing an ammonia sensor in the new freezer room.\n\n7. Instruct office personnel, during \"awareness\" training, as to the affects and evidence of ammonia, include an introduction to the facility's PSM program.\n\n8. Implement a PSM/RMP "
