There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period at the plants.\n\nTo comply with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), the initial step was to develop a prevention program as required by the RMP and by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. This prevention program was initiated at the Plants using a consulting organization. An RMP/PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site.\n\nKey items included in the manual were:\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\nO Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\no Chlorine system maintenance procedures \n\no Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\nO Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\no Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan \n\no Training in support of the certification of operators\n         \nThe superintendent, maintenance, and several plant operators are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/RMP regulation.\n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\n- The chlorine delivery system at the Tuckertown Water Treatment Plant was designed to use a vacuum process when it was constructed in 1992. This new process has proven to significantly improve chlorine safety by placing most of the cylinder system under vacuum. Any leak will result in air leaking into the system as compared to chlorine escaping"

      "SummaryText": " the system.\n\n- The chlorine delivery system at the Long Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant was changed to a full vacuum process in 2002. This new process has proven to significantly improve chlorine safety by placing all of the chlorine delivery system under vacuum. Any leak will result in air leaking into the system as compared to chlorine escaping the system.\n\n- The chlorine emergency response plan has been upgraded at all plants. The services of a regional hazardous material response team have been obtained to response to all chlorine incidences.\n\nFuture projects will evaluate using a vacuum chlorine process or alternatives to chlorine for disinfecting at the Hwy. 52 water treatment plant.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Albemarle has had an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site.  The committee's duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. \n\nWithin the Utilities Department, there are monthly safety meetings conducted by each plant. There is a review on an OSHA subject or a discussion on a specific water or wastewater safety issue. \n\nThe Utilities safety program involves the following activities:\n\no Conducting accident reviews for prevention/minimization; \no Conducting safety inspections for all facilities; \no Disseminating safety information to Utilities staff; \no Preparing and conducting safety training program including such topics as hazard communication, personal protective equipment, confined space and lockout/tagout; \no Verifying performance of  training programs;  \no Addressing safety issue referrals; \no Identifying mandatory regulatory agency-required safety training needs; \no Recognizing exemplary safety performance\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had a strong safety record with no loss time accident over the past three years. We plan "

The cause of this incident was a trained operator not following chlorine handling procedures included in our RMP.  Consequently, we revamped our procedures to make them clearer and easier to use and reinforced training of all personnel who come into contact with the process.\n\nReport by:\n                                                               \nGary Smith\nPlants Superintendent\nCity of Albemarle, North Carolina"
