This facility has a thorough emergency \ntraining program for on-site emergency responders.  This facility has implemented the \nSAP electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track \ntraining and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.\n\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response \ncoverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for \ncoordination with outside agencies, such as with the Springfield Fire Department in the \nevent of an emergency. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summ"

      "SummaryText": "ary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with \nammonia.\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nAt this location Kraft Foods Global, Inc. manufactures and processes dairy products.  The SIC code \nfor the primary process at this facility is 2023.  This facility is capable of producing various \ndairy products including cheese for consumer intake.  Many areas of the plant are \nrefrigerated to preserve the dairy products. Some of these areas include coolers, chillers, \nstorage tanks and some processes.  The plant also produces some pasta products. \n\nKraft Foods Global, Inc. has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68, anhydrous ammonia, at this \nlocation.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent for the refrigeration of the food products in \nthe various areas described above.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The \nquantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 141,247 pounds. Thus, 40 CFR 68 is \napplicable to Kraft Foods Global, Inc. in Springfield, MO.\n\n 3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration \nsystem.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical \nto the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has stated that if the process is in compliance with \nOSHA PSM, it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Kraft's ammonia PSM has \nbeen reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key:\n\n1.The Utility Service Area design (USA) serves as an excellent safeguard for \nplant personnel because it greatly reduces the amount of ammonia piping \ninside occupied rooms.  Since most of the pipe work is out of the way of \npeople and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia \nrelease.\n\n2.The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of \noperating procedures. \n\n3.A"

There have been no releases at this facility as defined in 40 CFR \nPart 68.42(a).\n\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program \n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response in which plant \nemployees are divided into various management and response teams.  There are nine in-\nplant contacts for an emergency, a list of these contacts can be found in the Emergency \nResponse Plan (SPCC).  There are also back-up personnel in the event that the primary incident \nresponse personnel cannot be contacted.  The emergency response plan includes \ninformation about the frequency of employee emergency response training, as well as a \ndetailed description of the training content.  There are also specific procedures to follow in \nthe event of a fire and ammonia emergency.  Response team members participate in a \nmock spill cleanup annually.  All trained ER team members have pagers/phones \nthat can be activated.    \n\nAt the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Springfield Fire Department will be \ncalled to provide emergency responders and equipment.  The Springfield Fire Department \nwill also be called for all fire related emergencies.  In all cases where an ambulance is \ncalled, the fire department is also called to the scene. \n\n\n6.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety -\n\nBased on the PHA completed for ammonia, a list of action items was developed and is \nbeing monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished. The \"What-If\" method \nis used for each component of the ammonia system.  There are numerous examples of \nsafety improvements as a result of the PSA results.  These improvements include:\n\nRecommendation #1:  Install a post to protect the gauge glass on the high-pressure ammonia receiver"

Consequently, all ammonia system components in this area are at risk of damage resulting in an ammonia release.\nCorrective action: A chain link fence was installed around the perimeter of the ammonia receiver and condenser area.  No vehicle traffic of any kind is permitted and the area was secured with a ?one-way? turnstile gate.  This was completed in January of 2002.\n\n\nRecommendation #2:  Install quick connect valves on all ammonia compressor thermosyphon heat exchangers to expedite system pump down in the event of an ammonia release from a flange (ref. Q4).\nAnalysis: A ?quick connection? type valve is not designed to be a safe application for extremely hazardous materials such as ammonia refrigerant.  The thermosyphon heat exchangers are equipped with accessible isolation valves and evacuation valves with a screwed and capped outlet connection.\nCorrective action:  None\n\nRecommendation #3:  Discontinue purchasing/installing inferior ?aftermarket? mechanical seals for ammonia screw compressors to reduce the frequency of seal failure and subsequent ammonia release (ref. Q5).\n Analysis:  Purchase history of mechanical seals supports recommendation.\nCorrective action: Purchase all ammonia screw compressor mechanical seals from OEM (FES) supplier effective in July of 2000 (exact date unknown).\n\nRecommendation #4:  Install a lock on ammonia receiver ?fill? valve so that Ammonia Operator on duty can inspect bulk vendor equipment prior to unloading (ref. Q7).\nAnalysis:  An excellent recommendation, both for the reason stated as well as for security of the ammonia system.\nCorrective action:  A lock was installed on the ammonia receiver ?fill? valve in July of 2000 (exact date unknown).\n\nRecommendation #5:  Install explosion proof lights, new exhaust fan, and hook existing alarms to Cantley (CAMS) system (ref.

The surge room would not be involved in this scenario; however, question # 11 could apply to this recommendation.  Exhaust fan was checked and found to have ?loose? belts.  The existing alarm system is audible and the area is normally occupied.  The existing alarm system also automatically starts the exhaust system when an ammonia level of 75ppm is reached. The installation of ammonia detectors (connected to the central control system) in all cooler/chiller areas is preferable but not critical to ammonia safety of the plant refrigeration system as these areas are typically staffed staffed 6/7 days/week and 24 hours/day.  \nCorrective action: 1.
