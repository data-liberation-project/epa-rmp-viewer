It is PM WindomA?s policy to design and operate a safe facility.  This is accomplished through the experience and training of our personnel.  Our emergency plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and potentially affected neighbors.  Employees are trained to handle minor leaks. \n\n\n\nSource and Regulated Substances\n\nAmmonia is the only regulated chemical that is onsite in quantities above the risk management program thresholds.  PM Windom uses ammonia for refrigeration.  Under normal temperature and pressure conditions, ammonia is a gas.  However, in part of the refrigeration process, ammonia is liquefied under pressure.  Refrigeration (or cooling) in the various meat coolers and freezers is accomplished through evaporation of ammonia.  Compressors are used to compress the ammonia gas.  Condensers are used to condense the ammonia gas to a liquid.  The cycle is repeated.  PM Windom installed the ammonia process in 1996.  Major process equipment in the process includes five compressors, two evaporative condensers, a high pressure receiver (HPR), two low pressure receivers (LPR), and cooler/freezer units.  The ammonia system capacity is 15,000 pounds.  The typical inventory for ammonia is 12,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nAdministrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\n\nPM Windom has policies and procedures in place to decrease the likelihood of an ammonia release event and to minimize the consequence if there is a release. Operators are trained in the proper usage and handling of these chemicals.  The process area has an ammonia gas detector which will signal an alarm on the computer and audible alarm.\n\n\n\nGeneral Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe ammonia process compli"
