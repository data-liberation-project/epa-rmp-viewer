The New Berlin, NY yogurt manufacturer has written this document in an effort to be prepared for emergencies relating to the anhydrous ammonia, which is currently used as a refrigerant above the threshold value, and to comply with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.  This document in conjunction with the Process Safety Management Program will be used to comply with the Title 40 regulations.\r\n  \r\nThe Chobani facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, in its refrigeration process.  There are five separate anhydrous ammonia systems located throughout the facility.  The systems are not co-located, and therefore each system was treated as a separate process.  With the exception of system MS2, each separate process is over the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for anhydrous ammonia.  As a precaution, release modeling was completed for all ammonia systems onsite.  Maximum, total on-site capacity for the five anhydrous ammonia systems is 61,118 pounds.\r\n\r\nAmmonia system MS1 is a refurbished system from the existing Kraft plant.  It is designed to hold 14,597 pounds of ammonia and has components located throughout the facility.  This system refrigerates the manufacturing facility and the storage silos.  Ammonia system MS2 is located at the west end of the manufacturing facility.  It is designed to hold 4,903 pounds of ammonia and refrigerates the manufacturing tunnel.  Ammonia system MS3 is centrally located in, and refrigerates, the manufacturing facility.  It is designed to hold 20,906 pounds of ammonia.  Ammonia system DS4 is designed to hold 10,681 pounds of ammonia and is located at the west end of the distribution facility.  This system refrigerates the distribution warehouse.  Ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "system MS5 is located on the northwest end of the manufacturing facility in the packaging building and is designed to hold 10,031 lbs. of ammonia.  When necessary, the substance is transferred to the ammonia receivers from both canisters and delivery trucks.\r\n\r\nChobani uses employee/contractor training, standard operating procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, management of change procedures, hot work permitting and auditing programs as the basis for its general release prevention program.  The facility has a preventative maintenance program, a pipe and valve labeling program, and an inspection program that are related to the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The management and employees of Chobani are continually looking for ways to improve the safety of the system.\r\n \r\nThere have been no known reportable accidental ammonia releases from the systems that have resulted in either an on-site or off-site consequence at the New Berlin, NY facility.  However, a release incident involving a small amount of ammonia was reported, but was not required to be. \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program at Chobani consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. A hazard assessment to understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the previous five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n2. A prevention program to maintain and safely operate the anhydrous ammonia process containing more than the threshold quantity of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n3. An emergency response system to respond to accidental releases from the ammonia process.\r\n\r\nChobani meets the eligibility requirements for Program 3 under the Risk Management Plan.  Program 3 eligibility requirements necessitate that the facility put into practice a prevention program that helps to minimize the likelihood of a release from the ammonia system while also minimizing the impacts should a release occur."

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Chobani New Berlin facility focuses on ways to prevent an accidental release of a hazardous substance.  The following sub-sections briefly describe the elements of Chobani's prevention program for utilizing anhydrous ammonia.  Full documentation can be found in the Process Safety Management program. \r\n\r\n 1.1 Process Safety Information: Chobani maintains multiple documents used to provide safe operation of the process.  These documents address (1) property and hazard information on substances used in the process, (2) specific process description, and (3) design basis configuration of process equipment.\r\n\r\n 1.2 Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS): MSDSs document the properties of hazardous substances on the premises, including anhydrous ammonia.  MSDSs are used to (1) provide health and safety information to employees, contractors and emergency responders, (2) train employees, and (3) perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs). MSDSs are used to provide instructions for proper handling of hazardous chemicals at the plant.  \r\n\r\n 1.3 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): The Chobani facility performs and periodically updates PHAs for the onsite process to identity potential process hazards and generate recommendations to improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering, environmental, process operating experience, maintenance, safety experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Chobani primarily uses the what-if technique, supplemented with checklists to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations to enhance the safet"

Responsibility is assigned to plant personnel to resolve the recommendations.\r\n\r\n 1.4 Operating Procedures: Chobani Managers, Engineers, Maintenance Operators, and Technicians work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define safe methods for performing tasks relating to the process.  Chobani personnel develop and maintain operating procedures to cover all phases of operation including; initial start-up, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, start-up following a turnaround, and temporary operations.  The operating procedures are used as both an instructional guide for operating the process and as a training tool for new and experienced operators.  The procedures are updated a minimum of annually to ensure that they reflect current operating conditions.    \r\n\r\n 1.5 Training: Workers are trained to perform their assigned tasks safely and effectively.  The Chobani training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards associated with the process substances, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral review and on-the-job training are used to verify that the employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.  The operators are consulted periodically to evaluate the effectiveness and requirement for additional training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\n 1.6 Mechanical Integrity: Chobani maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, contractors, the public and the environment.  This is accomplished by (1) an inspection and testing program to identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails, (2) a management of change program to ensure that new and replacement equipment is designed to meet the standards require"
