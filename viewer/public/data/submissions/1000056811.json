Harrisburg, PA facility (formally KTR Capital Partners) located at 3900 Industrial Road is a combination of dry storage and refrigerated spaces. This property was acquired when Prologis purchased all KTR Capital Partners assets 5/31/15. The goal is to have the spaces, both dry and refrigerated; leased by a customer or customers who will then take over the responsibility for the facility as far as compliance is concerned. In the mean time, Prologis has decommissioned the ammonia system located in the vacant refrigerated space. \n\n\n\n1.0    Identification of Covered Process - The overall plant charge is less than 10,000 Lbs., therefore, the OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA List Rule  does not apply.\n\n\n\n2.0    Program Level - The ammonia refrigeration system falls under the Program 3 guidelines.\n\n\n\n3.0    Management of Change - The management personnel with overall responsibility for the program is the Property Manager.\n\n\n\n4.0    Hazard Assessment - A hazard analysis has been performed on the Ammonia Refrigeration system. Three portions are included in this assessment.\n\n\n\n4.1   Worst Case Scenario - The worst Case Scenario, as defined by the EPA; \"the owner/operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.\"  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has been performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia before its concentration decreases to the toxic end point of 0.14mg/L. \n\n\n\n4.2   Alternative Case Scenario - The alternative case scenario was performed as above with the exception that the alternative case involves a relief valve release of 434 lbs over a 10 minute period. The result of this evaluation was a radius of 0.08 miles with an affected population of 0. Please refer to the alternative case section for specific details.\n\n\n\n4.3   Five Year Accident History - "

      "SummaryText": "Since Prologis took over the facility in May 2015 there have been no accidents. Accident history was not provided by the previous owner.\n\n\n\n5.0    Accident Prevention Program - Prologs L.P. - Harrisburg Facility is in full compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management guidelines for the method of Accident Prevention. The Accident Prevention and PSM Programs emphasize: operator training, preventative maintenance, state of the art equipment, use of accurate operating procedures, hazard reviews of the system, ammonia awareness, proper auditing program and inspection programs.\n\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Program - Prologis L.P. and Sygma currently have an Emergency Action Plan. The facility is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by a computer system that dials out to the owners and refrigeration service company if any parameters are violated. The refrigeration service company performs monthly walkthroughs of the facility and has the ability to dial into the control system to monitor the refrigeration system remotely. The emergency action plan is reviewed annually and all parties are to be informed of any facility changes.\n\n\n\n"
