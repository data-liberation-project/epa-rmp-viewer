The subject facility covered by the Risk Management Plan is located at 2650 South Chase Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe subject facility encompasses approximately 137,513 square feet which is divided internally into the following areas: hallways, shipping and receiving docks, fresh sausage kitchen, holding coolers, freezer, packaging, fresh sausage cooler, dry storage room, smoking and cooking room, stuffing department, smoke kitchen and raw meat cooler.\n\nKSC has adopted this Risk Management Program in order to implement the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act Amendments.  This Risk Management Program is required under 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68-Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, because KSC uses more than 10,000 pounds (lbs) of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) which is the threshold quantity.  The Risk Management Program will identify the process, the worst case and alternate scenarios, five-year accident history, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permit and contractors  to enable all those who may be affected to be able to identify and understand the hazards posed by the processes that involve NH3.\n\nThe Risk Management Program will be regularly reviewed and updated whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and procedures.\n\nIn conjunction with the PHA, KSC completed a compilation of written process safety information in order to enable KSC supervisory personnel and KSC employees who operate the equipment which affects the refrigeration system to identify and understand the hazards posed by NH3.

      "SummaryText": " as well as oil, chemicals and coolants were included.\n\nNH3 is the chemical formula for ammonia which exists as a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.  NH3 is considered to be a nonflammable gas by the Department of Transportation and consists of 99.5 percent (%) of grade C (industrial grade) anhydrous ammonia, 0.4 % water and 0.1 % oil.  NH3 has, for most people, a noticeable odor at 20 parts per million (ppm).  NH3 is moderately irritating to the nose at approximately 100 ppm and causes major throat irritation at approximately 400 ppm.\n\nAmmonia gas can be compressed into a liquid.  Liquid ammonia is a corrosive material which causes burns and is harmful if swallowed.   NH3 is reactive with the halogens (chlorine and bromine).  NH3 is also reactive with heavy metals and their salts (silver, mercury and gold) to produce shock sensitive materials which when dry tend to explode.\n\nNH3 is thermally stable as a gas and as a liquid.  However, when not confined, the NH3 will evaporate.  NH3 is reactive with many organic materials including acids, acid chlorides, halogens, acid anhydrides, oxidizing agents, chloroformates, galvanized iron, zinc, copper and tin and their alloys and, therefore, is not a stable material when in contact with other substances.  Ammonia is most stable when confined in steel containers.\n \nThe chemistry of NH3 in KSC?s refrigeration system is a conversion of liquid ammonia to gaseous ammonia and back to liquid ammonia.  Liquid NH3 is pumped through the system, the NH3 evaporates as it absorbs heat and cools the evaporator element, is converted back to a liquid by compression through the desuperheater and condenser, and is pumped into the high temperature receiver to repeat the process.\n\nThe maximum inventory in the system is approximately 12,100 lbs of NH3.  The steel tank in the equipment room is designed to contain approximately 7,800 lbs of NH3 at 90% capacity.  The refrigeration system (tank and piping) can contain more ammonia; ho"

At least one member of the team is knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.  The team also includes at least one employee who has experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated.\n\nKSC has developed and implemented written operating procedures for the tasks that KSC personnel perform (compressor service oil change, drain oil traps, switch liquid pumps, service cooling tower screens and nozzles, add oil to compressors and liquid pumps, add chemicals to cooling tower and clean purger).  Contractors which perform other maintenance and repair activities will familiarize themselves with KSC?s system and prepare operating procedures for their activities.  KSC?s procedures do, and their contractor?s operating procedures will, provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.  Operating procedures have been prepared for initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations as the need arises, emergency operations, including emergency shutdowns, and authorized personnel to initiate these procedures, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround, or after an emergency shutdown.\n\nEach employee presently involved in a process has been, and each employee before working in a newly assigned process, will be trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures.

A permit will be required for all hot work operations.\n\nAll contemplated changes to a process must be thoroughly evaluated in order to assess their potential impact upon the safety and health of employees and to determine what modifications to operating procedures may be necessary.  KSC has therefore established written procedures to manage those changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures and facilities that affect a covered process.  Those procedures will not, however, cover \"replacements in kind.?\n\nWritten procedures to manage changes to the process were developed and will be adhered to.  All incidents will be investigated that have either resulted in a catastrophic release of ammonia in the workplace, or could reasonably have so resulted.  Each such incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  The five-year accident history only goes to 1997 and no releases have occurred.\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis has been performed to evaluate worst-case and likely upset conditions.\n \nKSC has established a process to assign an incident investigation team to thoroughly investigate and analyze each such incident.  The members of the investigation team include at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience.  The investigation team must prepare a report at the conclusion of the investigation activities.\n\nKSC will establish a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report's findings and recommendations.

KSC?s Emergency Action Plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.  Large releases will be addressed by the Milwaukee County Sheriff?s Emergency Division.\n\nThe Risk Management Program is designed to be a written statement of overall company process safety management and risk management rules and policies.  There are a number of additional work rules, procedures, requirements, documents, reports, and separate programs that apply in particular situations or that are required by particular laws or regulations (for example:  hazard communication/right-to-know).  Some of them are in writing and some are not.
