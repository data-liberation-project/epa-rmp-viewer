General accidental release and prevention policy of Affiliated Foods.\n\n\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\n\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\n\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\n\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\n\nthe environment. \n\n It is our policy at Affiliated Foods to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\n\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and\n\nstate regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental\n\nrelease of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our\n\nplant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety\n\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nAffiliated Foods, 12103 I-30, Little Rock, Arkansas, operates a refrigeration system utilizing\n\nanhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. \n\n\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a\n\nheat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The\n\nrefrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion.\n\nEvaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the\n\nrefrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated\n\nenergy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid\n\ntem"

The refrigeration system uses\n\nthis phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through\n\ncondensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\n\n\n\nThe Affiliated Foods facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain storage room temperatures\n\nfor various types of fresh and frozen food distributed to their customers. The refrigeration system\n\ncontains the following equipment: Three screw compressors, one evaporative condensers, one\n\nhigh pressure receiver, one recirculator, one accumulator, one balance tank, twelve cooler/freezer\n\nevaporators and a system purger. The refrigeration system contains 14,000 pounds of aggregate\n\nammonia.\n\n\n\nThere are approximately 350 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel. \n\nThis distribution facility receives and prepares shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products\n\nvia tractor trailers approximately 24 hours a day, six days a week.  \n\n\n\nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not\n\nlimited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\n \n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\n\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\n\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\n\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\n\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \n\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\n\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n\n\n3.
