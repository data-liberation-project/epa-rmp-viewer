      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - CITY OF EL CENTRO WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe City of El Centro Water Treatment Plant is located at 3010 South 8th Street, El Centro, CA 92243, off Interstate 8. \n\nThe City of El Centro (CEC) has developed a Risk Management Plan to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785).  CEC is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  CEC staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine for water treatment.  Chlorine plays an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine system. The facilityA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe chlorine system at the City of El Centro's Water Treatment Plant is used for the treatment of water from the supply canals prior to pumping into the City's water supply pipelines.\n\nThe Chlorine Storage Room contains 8-10 one-ton chlorine cylinders, one chlorine detector (set @ 1 ppm), automatic switchover valves, one vacuum regulator, and one exhaust fan that is operated manually whenever personnel enter the room.  Two independent manifold systems (one active and the other kept on standby) are connected to a common header that feeds into the Chlorination Room.  City of El Centro Operators use a monorail hoist to replace chlorine cyli"

      "SummaryText": "nders.\n\nThe chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  Each active one-ton cylinder is placed on a scale to allow City of El Centro Operators to plan ahead for ordering more chlorine and for planning the change-out procedure.  Each container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  A vacuum regulator is mounted directly on the active chlorine cylinder.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from the active one-ton cylinder, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum will be drawn through the chlorinators and into solution.\n\nScrubbers are not installed in any of the Water Treatment Plant rooms; however, each chlorine detector triggers an alarm that will alert the Operators to a high ambient chlorine concentration in either the Chlorination Room or in the Chlorine Storage Room.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp and SLAB Dispersion modeling were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.   The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation.  RMP*Comp and SLAB Dispersion Modeling were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used.  RMP*Comp and SLAB Dispersion Modeling were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough "

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are chlorine leak detectors situated in all rooms that contain chlorine (2 total).  In the event of a chlorine gas leak, the detectors relay a signal that activates a horn and a light outside the room where chlorine has been detected.  In addition, the alarm is displayed on the control system panel.  At 1 ppm, the alarm signal is directly wired to alert the El Centro Police Department Dispatch.

These studies include the following: Process Hazard Analysis, Seismic Assessment, and Hazard Assessment.  Any outstanding recommendations from these studies were addressed by December 2005.\n\n\nNOTE: New treatment plant was constructed in 2009 on the same plot of land but in a different location.\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - CITY OF EL CENTRO NEW WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe El Centro WTP has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.  The El Centro WTPA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines.  The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 20,000 pounds of chlorine kept in ten one-ton containers.  Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by an immediate visual detection system.  Special paint is applied near possible leak areas that turns from golden yellow to red when gas with a pH of 3 or less is present.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\nScenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Gaseous Chlorine Disinfection System.

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the El Centro WTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine release.  The facility has chlorine detectors that activate a Scrubber System.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the El Centro WTP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine.
