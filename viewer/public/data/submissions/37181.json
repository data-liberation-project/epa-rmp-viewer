Accidential release prevention and emergency response policies:\nAt this facility we package aerosol products, using two different propellant blends of propane, isobutane, and butane in addition to also using DME, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations in the handling of these propellants.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the propellants and solvents, combined with the safety devices inherent in our facility.  We are continually updating our training of our personnel and insuring safe handling procedures are developed and used.\nOur emergency response program is based upon the NPGA'LP-Gas Safety Handbook and Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for nitification of the local fire authority, police, federal, state, hospital, emergency response personnel, Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and any potentially affected neighborhoods.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to package aerosol products using flammable propellants and solvent blends.  They are received at the facility in tankers, totes, and drums.  The (bulk) material is stored in 3 propellant tanks, 6 flammable solvent storage tanks, and the totes and drums are stored in our flammable storage/mixing room.  Fencing with 3 gates restricts access to the facility.  Visitors, contractors etc. must check-in at the main office.\nThe maximun amount of flammable propellant that can be stored in the 3 tanks is 23,000 gallons.  The maximum amount of flammable solvents in the 6 bulk tanks, totes, and drums that can be stored at this facility is 19,000 gallons.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\nControls are in place when the propellant tanks are being filled by a highly trained delivery driver.

Five-year accident history:\nNone to repot.\n\n5.  The emergency response program.\nThe emergency response program is in place as per the RCRA Emergency/Contingency Plan reguirements.  In the event of a hazardous event, the local-state-federal authorities are notified as needed.  The local hospital will also be notified if required.  The Detroit Water & Sewerage Department will be notified if material has entered the drain system.\nAt this facility we operate under the following guidelines: Site Emergency Plan, Safety Rules for Office & Plant Personnel, Procedures for Tanker Off-loading, Hazardous Waste Management, RCRA Emergency/Contingency Plan, City of Detroit Water & Sewerage Department, and our Pollution Prevention Plan covers the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) - Pollution Incident Prevention Plan (PIPP) - Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\nAll regulatory requirements are constantly reviewed for accuracy.  The rules are constantly updated/graded at different time frames throughout the year and our changes are made accordingly.  Telephone numbers are checked for correct area codes.  Safety Plan is presently in the process of change.  Another new Spill Plan has been developed and approved by the City of Detroit Water & Sewerage Department.  Daily walk arounds are the norm for the Safety Director and area supervisors and employees are encouraged to address safety concerns in all areas."
