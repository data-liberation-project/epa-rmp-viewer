THE FACILTY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF CENTRAL LAKES COOPERATIVE ARE COMMITED\nTO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILTY IS PREPARED TO WORK  WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MIGRATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMUIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELAEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE  ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.   FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nTHE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS. ANHYDROUS AMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR BOTH DIRECT APPLICATION AND FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTIY STORED WOULD BE 160,000 POUNDS IN ALL OUR TANKS.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. \n\nA. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON A 2 MINUTE RELEASE ON A 3 INCH PIPE LEAK. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT TO DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1 PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 C"
