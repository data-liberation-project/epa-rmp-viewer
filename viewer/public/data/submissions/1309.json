      "SummaryText": "In accordance with  40 CFR Part 68.10, the City of Athens has compiled this Risk Management Plan as defined in Subpart G of the same text.  The City of Athens operates a Surface Water Treatment Plant designed to produce up to 6 million gallons a day of potable water.  The facility is located at 4663 FM Road 2892 and draws its raw water from Lake Athens. The Surface Water facility is in operation up to 24 hours a day year round depending on demand loads and peak periods.  The location was design engineered to meet all State and Federal requirements which will insure the safety of the public and the operators.\n\nThe potable water produced by this facility must meet parameters set forth by the State of Texas.   The design of this Athens facility requires the use of chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5)  for disinfection purposes.   Threshold quantities outlined in 40 CFR Part 68  apply to the chlorine stored and used at the Surface Water Treatment  facility.  Chlorine is a toxic oxidizing  substance which is routinely used in small measured quantities for disinfection.  Disinfection is the most important process in the production of safe drinking water. In its natural state, chlorine exists in the form of a gas which is heavier then air.  Thus when released, it will move to low spots in the terrain and remain until dissipated. However, chlorine is usually held and stored under pressurized conditions were it exists in a liquid state.  It only converts back to a gas when it comes into contact with the atmosphere.\n\nThe Surface Water Treatment facility stores and uses chlorine gas held in individual 1 ton ASME coded containers.  The design of the holding area and transfer devices was based on guidelines set forth by the National Chlorine Institute.   Regulating devices are attached directly to the chlorine containers and are designed to shut down if a major leak occurs in the distribution lines and piping.\n\nState Certified personnel operate and manage this facility.

Personnel also receive required training in emergency procedures and safety management along with Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) interpretation and implementation. A self-contained breathing apparatus is available at all times and each operator is required to be experienced in its operation.  Annual inspections of this facility are performed by the City of Athens Fire Department.  Emergency response procedures have been compiled and are updated routinely by the Athens Fire Department.  A copy of the City of Athens Emergency Response Program is on file with the Henderson County Emergency Response Coordinator.\n\nThe history of safety related accidents occurring at the Athens Water Treatment facility is untarnished.  The safeguards and protection systems built into the facility along with the knowledge and training received by the operators suggest that any type of accidental release involving chlorine would not likely cause negative offsite consequences.   The City of Athens will continue to take all necessary steps to insure the safety of its citizens and to provide clean and safe drinking water at all times."
