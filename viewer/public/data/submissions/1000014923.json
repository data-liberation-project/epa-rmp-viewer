      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Ethanol 2000 facility (dba POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake)is located approximately one half mile southwest of Bingham Lake, MN in Cottonwood County.  The POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in 1996.  POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 20% alcohol by volume and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank Nos. 805 and 802, The largest quantity is stored in Tank 802, which has a capacity of 39,000 gallons (approximately 250,000 pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol via circulation blending in the denatured ethanol storage tanks.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER the EPA CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NGC denaturant and anhydrous ammonia (used to control acidity in the produced ethanol) are the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemicals present at POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake which exceed the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated denaturant process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tanks, the three denatured ethanol storage tanks and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 1% to 3%.  The "

The CAPP/RMP regulated anhydrous ammonia process consists of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, and the associated transfer and injection equipment.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY AND PROGRAM\nPOET Biorefining-Bingham Lake is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  In the event of an emergency, POET Biorefining-Bingham LakeA?s Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake to notify the Windom Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nPOET Biorefining-Bingham Lake is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level cont"

All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing recordable and reportable accidents.  There have been no accidents since startup of the plant in 1996 which require inclusion in the five-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake management team is committed to an on-going system of reviewing changes in available technologies and any previous plant incidents to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.  Planned changes to improve safety include ongoing efforts to achieve more comprehensive tracking via the computer based maintenance program (Maximo), which is being implemented to include automatic scheduling and work order generation for all preventative maintenance inspections and tests.\n"
