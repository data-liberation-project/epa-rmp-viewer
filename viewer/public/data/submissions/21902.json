This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including: \n\n- Introduction;\n- ATOFINA Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety;\n- Faciltiy Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes; \n- Hazard Assessment; \n- Prevention Program; \n- Five-Year Accident History; \n- Emergency Response Plan; and \n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nATOFINA Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ATOFINA for many years.  This Risk Management Plan formalizes and documents these activities.  ATOFINA is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reduce risks to health and the environment.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicate time to review HES matters.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ATOFINA's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.\n\nATOFINA's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ATOFINA's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nThis facility is covered by Title V of the Clean Air Act, but has not received a permit as of the date of th"

The facility manufactures mercaptans and sulfides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and include: \n\nCarbon Disulfide (CS2) 2,540,000 lbs\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S) 13,000 lbs\n\nCarbon Disulfide (CS2) is a by-product of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) production.  Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) is manufactured on site to produce mercaptans.\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario is associated with a catostrophic failure of a Carbon Disulfide (CS2) rail car.  Carbon Disulfide (CS2) is manufactured and placed in rail cars for shipment to customers.  Administrative controls limit the CS2 quantity in rail cars to a maximum of 192,300 lbs.  This quantity is assumed to be released over a 10 minute period in the worst-case scenario with a 24 minute evaporation rate in consideration of the extent of release.\n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst-case conditions, a release of CS2 could travel up to 16 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public and environmental receptors.  It should be noted that the worst-case scenario is recognized by the regulatory agency and Elf Atochem as an extremely unlikely event.  Mitigation and prevention procedures and measures are implemented by Elf Atochem to reduce the risk of the worst case event occuring.\n\nWorst-Case Release Mitigation Measures\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Houston facility make it very unlikely that a significant release of CS2 similar to the worst case scenario will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, ATOFINA has an array of mitigation measure"

Mitigation measures include:\n\n- A  Carbon Disulfide (CS2) vapor supression system (deluge system), which can be supplemented by stationary and portable fire monitors, to remove airborne vapor with water sprays;\n\n- A pumping system and procedures which would allow CS2 to be pumped from a damaged rail car or tank into another storage tank or vessel to reduce the amountof CS2 which could be potentially released;\n\n- Gas detection devices placed strategically in the facility to provide early detection of a release; and\n\n- The facility has on-site emergency responders 24 hours per day as well as a defined communications link with additional off-site responders and response equipment.\n\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOne Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic substance was also modeled during the hazard assessment.  A description of each of these scenarios and the impact follows.  The Alternative Release Scenario for Carbon Disulfide (CS2) was defined to be a failure of a 2\" nozzle on the bottom of a CS2 storage vessel.  The release plume was estimated to have an effective radius of .27 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario defined to be applicable for modeling consideration was for a release of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) associated with a flange leak on a reactor.  The H2S plume from this leak was estimated at .43 miles before dispersing sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors.\n\nAlternative"

If a release should occur, ATOFINA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact, which include:\n\n-  Vapor supression systems (deluge systems), which can be supplemented by stationary and portable fire monitors, to remove airborne vapor with water sprays;\n\n- Pumping systems and procedures which would allow materials to be pumped from a damaged rail car, or loaded tank, into another storage tank or vessel to reduce the amount potentially released;\n\n- Gas detection devices placed strategically in the facility to provide early detection of a release; and\n\n- The facility has on-site Emergency Response Teams 24 hours per day as well as a defined emergency communications link with additional off-site responders and response equipment.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe ATOFINA Chemical, Inc.  Houston facility has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program addresses those processes which handle regulated substances.  The accidental release prevention program includes the following components and activities:\n\n- In-depth hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standard of 29 CFR 1910.119;\n\n- Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the gene"

There have been two personal injury (employee) incidents at the facility that meet the EPA RMP reporting requirements associated with release of hydrogen sulfide.  There were no known off-site impacts associated with the incidents.
