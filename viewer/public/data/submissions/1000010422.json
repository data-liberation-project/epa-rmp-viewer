Compliance audits will be conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members.  The audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\nSince the Antelope Hills Gas Plant is a new facility, there is no previous accident history.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant will maintain a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect the the safety of workers and the public, as well as the environment.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire department, and mechanisms for notification are in place.  Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency actions.  The emergency action plan is updated when necessary, and affected personnel are informed and/or trained in the changes.  The gas plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant has resolved all findings from PHAs."

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through test, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant will use contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1)perform their work in a safe manner, (2)have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3)are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4)understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5)understand and follow plant safety rules, and (6)inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1)a process overview, (2)information about safety and health hazards, (3)emergency response plan requirements, and (4)safe work practices prior to their begining work. In addition, the Antelope Hills Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant conducts a PSSR any new facility or process modification that require a change in the process safety information.

The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:  (1)conducting training, (2)scheduled preventive maintenance, (3)performing inspections and test, (4)correcting identified deficiencies, and (5)applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activitiews form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1)an overview of the process, (2)safety and health hazards, (3)applicable maintenance procedures, (4)emergency action plan, and (5)applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g.,adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or plant management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nManagement of Change\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant utilizes a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1)ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2)verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incidents or a similiar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the 'What-If' analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guidedby a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard anyalysis results.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n   \n     Release Detection\n       *Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n       *Release Containment Control\n       *Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n       *Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n       *Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high \n        temperature)\n       *Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n       *Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for\n        process control system, backup pumps)\n       *Atmospheric relief devices\n\n     Release Mitigation\n       *Fire extinguishers\n       *Trained personnel\n       *Personal protective equipment\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Antelope Hills Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing thi"

      "SummaryText": "Antelope Hills Gas Plant Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\nFrontier Field Services, LLC (FFC) owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Antelope Hills Gas Processing Plant, outside of Glazier, TX. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\nSection 112(r)of the Clean Air Act applies to the Antelope Hills Gas Processing Plant because the plant handles and stores several EPA regulated flammable substances: methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1. '112(r)(1)-Purpose and General Duty Clause-The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  FFS is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Antelope Hills Gas Processing Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location of our neighbours in the community. FFS,therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness for our facility.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan-The Antelope Hills Gas Processing Plant processes natural gas, recovering natural gas liquids and producing pipeline quality natural gas. This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in '112(r). Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan. For planning purposes, FFS has considered th"

      "SummaryText": "e impact of a worst case accident. Information gathered indicates that 0 persons live within the potential impact radius. It should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote-far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nFFS also considered the impact of a more likely release. This alternative release is characterized as an accident during a daily routine. Using RMP*Comp, the impact distance of a potential explosion of the vapor cloud formed after this release was calculated to be 0.3 miles. No off-site receptors, such as residences, schools, churches, and parks are located within this radius. FFS has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. FFS has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection prodedures. FFS provides annual emergency response training to its employees. In addition, FFS has coordinated with local emergency responders including the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nFFS is committed to the following:\n     *Preventing accidents;\n     *Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n     *Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n     *Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated \n      with FFS operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operations of the processes.
