If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the City of Laurinburg Fire Department as well as the Scotland County Department of Emergency Services, as necessary. Medical emergencies will require notification of the Scotland County EMS and Scotland Memorial Hospital.  This facility has an Emergency Action Plan; however, does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Laurinburg & Southern Railroad Co., Inc. - Laurinburg & Southern Transload Terminal is a butane transloading facility (specifically, railcar to truck tanker). This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transloading process at the Terminal including the transloading units and track space for storage of up to 150 butane railcars.\n\n\n\nThis facility has conducted an offsite consequence analysis and prepared a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario analysis in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the RMP Standard.\n\n\n\nThe Laurinburg & Southern Railroad Co., Inc. - Laurinburg & Southern Transload Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120 for 1st Responder Awareness), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has reported one (1) incident in the past 5 years. The incident occurred 10/14/2014 and resulted in the release of 11,500 pounds of butane due to an error in the transloader operation. No onsite or offsite impacts or environmental damage was reported. An incident investigation was conducted and determined that the initiating event that led to the release was human error due to a lack of training. An action plan was developed and appropriate personnel were retrained.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Laurinburg & Southern Railroad Co., Inc. - Laurinburg & Southern Transload Terminal's butane transloading system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the City of Laurinburg Fire Department and request their assistance. The facility personnel are trained in incipient stage fire response and 1st Responder Awareness. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate departments include Stewartsville and Maxton) and the Scotland County Department of Emergency Services. The City of Laurinburg Fire Department is aware of the system and its available fire protection systems (site fire extinguishers, hydrants and emergency shut-off devices).  The primary hazardous materials response capabilities are provided by the North Carolina Regional Response Team 3.\n\n\n\nImprovement actions to be considered primarily focus on improved contractor/visitor programs and potential additions for transloader layers of protection (both engineering and administrative controls). Other anticipated improvements include entrance information signage.\n\n"
