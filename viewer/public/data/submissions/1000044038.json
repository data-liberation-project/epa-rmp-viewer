As such, all Union Carbide facilities now operate under and adhere to policies and standards of The Dow Chemical Company. The Union Carbide facilities at South Charleston, Institute, Technology Park, ,and New Yard share leveraged support and management and are collectively called West Virginia Operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nWest Virginia Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Kanawha/Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe South Charleston site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many different specialty chemicals and plastics. Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products. Several RMP covered processes were closed just prior to the 2004 5-year RMP Update due to business reasons, and their related chemicals have been eliminated from Union Carbide's South Charleston facility. Since the 2009 RMP submittal, one additional RMP covered process has been shut down and subsequently removed from RMP.\n\n\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regu"

RMP regulated substances were removed from this process during shutdown.\n\n\n\nThe maximum threshold quantity of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide for the South Charleston Site has increased, compared to the 2009 RMP, due to revised estimation methods.\n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case release scenario has been revised to reflect current operating conditions, and with consideration of largest quantity of an RMP regulated substance from a single vessel or piping.\n\n\n\nThe toxic alternative-case release scenarios for ethylene oxide and propylene oxide were determined using the RMPComp tool in lieu of previous use of the PHAST 6.1 model.  Additionally, the alternative-case release quantity for propylene oxide was decreased from 2009.  This is due to quantifying only the amount of propylene oxide contained within UCC-owned piping.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSouth Charleston has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUnion Carbide's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule, OSHA's PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System. Key elements include:\n\n\n\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, Equipment Design Specification sheets, Reactive Chemicals Test results, and many others. This"
