      "SummaryText": "The Henkel Corporation Elgin Facility, uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable as a reactant at our facility also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling TDI to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our coworkers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle TDI combined with (1) safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures that we use, and (3) the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Elgin facility is to produce polyurethane coatings and adhesives, which are shipped to a contracted warehouse prior to sale or directly to customers to be used in a variety of applications ranging from composite construction materials to food and medical instrument packaging.  TDI is one of the reactants used in the manufacture of these products.  TDI is received by tank truck and stored in an indoor storage tank that is contained to prevent the loss of any material outside of the building should a massive failure occur.  The TDI is pumped to vessels within the same building, where the TDI is mixed with other reactants, solvents and additives to form the finished coating or adhesive. The final product is then pumped into drums or pails for shipment to our customers. \n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.  TDI is the only substance handled at this facility that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  \n\n\n\nThe Elgin facility has Spill Prevention Contingency plans.  These plans emphas engineering controls where practical and details procedures to follow should a release occur and training requirements for those employees involv"

The site is also covered under the OSHA PSM program requirements. The Elgin Facility's emergency response plan calls for notification of the local fire department and any potential neighbors."
