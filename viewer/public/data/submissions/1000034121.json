It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Central City Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Linn County Emergency Management Agency will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Central City, Iowa location is Dave Wilt, location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.

      "SummaryText": "his facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of several large storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is six (6).\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.                                         \n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Central City, provisions have been designed to notify all affecte"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 with amendments and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Innovative Ag Services has extended to the Central City Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nInnovative Ag Services, Central City, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Innovative Ag Services Co. to immediately notify the Central City Volunteer Fire Department and the Linn County Emergency Management Agency to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Central City Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Central City location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Central City has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.

Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understand of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
