Relief valves are replaced by an ASME certified agent on a five-year schedule. \nFurther, all PSM elements and RMP required sections are adhered to through the Blue Harvest PSM RMProgram.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The emergency ventilation discharges the engine\nroom air through the roof, which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for\nresponders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia\nwith greater air turbulence.\n\nDetection as a mitigation measure is used for employee notification, automatic ventilation activation, and automatic system shutdown.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the last five years there have been no federal reportable releases that caused death, injury, hospitalization or property damage.  \n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nA process release would be detected by ammonia sensors located in process and perimeter locations.  A process release would also be detected by the employees through odor.  The ammonia sensors are tested semi-annually.  An alarm signal is triggered and would sound throughout the facility.  An alarm system auto-dialer is also activated if ammonia is detected.\n\nIn the event of a process release, the alarm system auto-dialer calls the facility maintenance department, which would in turn contact the New Bedford Fire Department if any of the following conditions are present:\n\n\u00bf\tUpon investigating the incident, Blue Harvest Foods determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance; \n\u00bf\tReportable quantities of ammonia are released; and\n\u00bf\tA potential for fire exists.\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan\nwill be available to the local REPC and New Bedford FD for review.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Mechanical Integrity Audit of the Ammonia System was performed in March 2022, and a Process Hazard Analy"

The ammonia refrigeration process at Blue Harvest Foods (process) has been designed and operates in compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable State and local codes and regulations. Blue Harvest Foods has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel and contractors knowledgeable in the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM & RMP programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan (i.e., Contingency Plan) as required under OSHA PSM, Blue Harvest has emergency response procedures in place that comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nBlue Harvest Foods is a food processing facility primarily engaged in the preparation and packaging of seafood products.  The facility is situated on 7.2 acres, and is a 213,000 sq. ft. Industrially zoned facility with an inventory capacity of 26,332 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As Blue Harvest Foods anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at Blue Harvest is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\nSystem Classification\nThis refrigeration syste"
