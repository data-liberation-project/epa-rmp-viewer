If an accidental \nrelease should occur; the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\nThis facility has been newly equipped and approved for the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 52,000 pounds in one (1) 12,000-gallon storage tank.\n\n3 Accidental (Worse-Case) Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is <.25 miles.\n\n4 The Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\t-have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\t-to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5 The Emergency Response Program\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
