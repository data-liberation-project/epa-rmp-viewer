      "SummaryText": "nexAir, LLC is a premier distributor of industrial and medical gases in the South-Eastern United States.  nexAir, LLC is dedicated to protecting the health and safety of its employees and the public while complying with all applicable laws and regulations.  At the nexAir Gas Cylinder Filling Plant in Norcross, Ga; Propane Cylinder Filling is the only flammable process covered under Risk Management Regulations.  nexAir production plant has had excellent record in operational safety, and we will continue this serious commitment towards the safety and well-beings of ourselves and the public.  Worst Case and Alternative Release Case scenarios involving LP-Gas (Propane) were studied.  Impact end point radii were calculated, and the residence populations within the impact radii were documented.   Level 3 Prevention Programs were developed for the Propane production processes.  The Prevention Programs were aimed at minimizing the possibility of flammability hazards during unwanted release.  Included in the prevention programs are process training, equipment maintenance, possible release scenarios, standard operating procedures, incident investigation systems, etc.  We at nexAir have every confidence that the comprehensiveness and effective implementation of the prevention programs can seriously contribute to the safety and efficiency of our processes."
