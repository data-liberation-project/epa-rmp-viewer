      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. \nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training \npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.\nOur facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed \nbased on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable \ncontrols to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our \ntrained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex is located at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois 60563.  \nThe facility is owned by BP Corporation North America Inc.  The primary purpose of the facility is to conduct both\npetroleum and chemical research and development.  A secondary purpose is to provide office space for \na other BP employees unrelated to the research and development activities.  At present, the \nfacility has only one process -- the 300 Tank Farm -- which is subject to the Clean Air Act Risk \nManagement Planning requirements.  This process contains three flammable regulated substances \nwhich are in excess of the threshold quantity as follows:  propylene and ethylene.  The tank farm has \nan additional tank, formerly used to store an isobutylene mixture, which is currently out of service and has \nbeen filled with low pressure nitrogen.  Please note that the BP Naperville Complex has no regulated toxic substances in \nexcess of  the threshold quantity.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) with an \noverpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The WCS endpoint is based on the \ninstantaneous release of the"

Nearby public receptors \ncould be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail \nin this document.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the facility is a VCE resulting from the \nrelease of propylene through a relief valve at the 300 Tank Farm.  It is not anticipated that this release\nwould travel beyond property boundaries.  However, operators would still respond to the situation in a \ntimely manner. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the BP Naperville \nComplex for all EPA RMP covered processes, presently only the 300 Tank Farm.  Since this process is \nalso regulated by the OSHA PSM standard, this summary is organized in the format of the OSHA PSM \nelements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex encourages employees who work at the 300 Tank Farm to participate \nin multiple facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee \nparticipation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a \nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the \nfacility prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved are documented in the \nemployee participation plan.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe personnel at the 300 Tank Farm keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation.

This information is supplemented by\ndocuments that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with \nthe inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The 300 Tank Farm has documented safety-related limits for \nspecific process parameters.  The 300 Tank Farm personnel help assure that the process is maintained \nwithin these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective \ninstrument systems.  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation \nfrom these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe 300 Tank Farm also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and \nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure\n and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This \ninformation, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for \nestablishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and \nfacility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected \npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that research and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Naperville Complex has \nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New \nemployees receive basic training in research and development  operations.  After successfully \ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties \nand tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) adequate \nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure \nthat their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Written procedures help \nensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and\ntests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is \nwithin acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, \nemployees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an \nMOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the \nsafe operation of the equipment.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex has a hot work permit program which details those areas which \nrequire a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas\nfor all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc.  The procedure includes accountability and \nresponsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot\nwork until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with \nthe hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex has a  system to manage changes to the 300 Tank Farm.  \nThis system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology \n(including process operating conditions), procedures, and other changes be properly reviewed \nand authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls \nare in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised \nby the change"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are\nprovided any necessary training on the change.  The system helps to ensure that all documentation is \nupdated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably \ncould have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or \npersonal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions \nto prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its \nfindings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management\nfor resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and \nrecommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or \nrecommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including \ncontractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least \n5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly at the 300 Tank Farm, the \nBP Naperville Complex periodically conducts an audit. Compliance audits are conducted at least\nevery 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audit along with the audit team members.  The audit \nteam develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in\nresponse to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each \nfinding is documented, and the two most recent audit repo"

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all \nProgram 3 EPA RMP covered processes at the BP Naperville Complex, currently only the 300 \nTank Farm.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios\nthat could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the BP Naperville Complex has process\nsafety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and \n(3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the 300 \nTank Farm. \n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarm.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n2. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n3. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control \n     system, backup firewater pump)\n4. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n2. Deluge systems for specific equipment\n3. Trained emergency response personnel\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place\nto protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program includes  procedures for\nresponding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a\nflammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency\nresponse, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and\na"
