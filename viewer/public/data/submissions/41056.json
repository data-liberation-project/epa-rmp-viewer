Croton Lake Gatehouse is one of the locations where some of the City's water is treated with chlorine.\n\nNew York City DEP is committed to protecting the public,  its employees,  and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \n\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately notify the DEP Police Croton Command Center to mobilize DEP's emergency response team to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through county emergency management agencies.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nDEP is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, an individual, designated as the RMP Responsible Manager, has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP Responsible Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the NYC DEP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\nChlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\nProcess Safety Information to document the safe process design;\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n\nOperating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n\nMaintenance, inspection and te"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major chlorine release that could have had adverse effects on the public.  \n\nEmergency Response\n\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Kensico Facility has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Fire Department. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the DEP Police Croton Command Center who would dispatch DEP's Emergency Response Team to the site to handle the chlorine release. The Croton Command Center would also notify local emergency personnel to support DEP's emergency response team.\n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n\nThe NYC DEP continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect the community we serve and employees.  The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices.
