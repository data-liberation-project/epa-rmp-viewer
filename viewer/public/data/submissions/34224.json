Madison-Kipp Corporation is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Madison-Kipp workers, its neighbors and the surrounding environment.\n\nMadison-Kipp Corporation uses chlorine gas in its RCI furnaces to adjust the metallurgy of the aluminum it melts for diecasting purposes. Low pressure chlorine gas is injected into the molten aluminum through a metal pump that is designed for this purpose. The chlorine reacts with magnesium in the aluminum to form magnesium chloride which floats to the top and becomes part of the dross.  The dross is skimmed off and sent to a recycler. \n\nMadison-Kipp maintains a maximum of three full one-ton containers and one empty container in a scrubber controlled storage room in the northeast corner of the Atwood Avenue production facility. The chlorine room was sited to obtain minimal handling of the chlorine containers and short piping in the plant.  Handling of containers and piping must be minimized to prevent accidents.  The chlorine room has a four-hour fire rating to minimize the odds of a release if the plant would catch fire.  The room is alarmed for security, diked, and has a scrubber that activates when the chlorine concentration in the room reaches 3 PPM. The scrubber is capable of neutralizing the entire contents of a one-ton container. An alarm and exterior light warns of the scrubber activation. Two containers are placed on a scale and one of the two supplies chlorine to the furnaces. The other two containers are stored along side the scale.\n\nMadison-Kipp also maintains an emergency generator to supply power to the chlorine safety systems.  Our operating procedure states that chlorine tanks will be closed when the plant is not in operation.  \n\nPiping for the chlorine system runs from the chlorine room up to the ceiling, along the ceiling to the RCI furnace, and down to"

      "SummaryText": " the chlorine-nitrogen panel. This piping is also encased within PVC piping for redundant protection should a leak develop within the primary pipe. This additional piping would carry any leaked chlorine back to the storage room for scrubber control. All chlorine outside the room is piped under low-pressure.\n\nThe system is currently limited to using no more than 63 pounds of chlorine per hour. At an internal administrative maximum use restriction of 60 pounds per hour (assuming continuous maximum operation) a chlorine delivery would be necessary about every four days. Actual chlorine usage requires are much less since we are limited to a maximum of 48 containers per year or less than one container a week.\n\nThe Madison fire department Hazmat team has trained on our system and takes tours of our system.  Both Madison-Kipp Corporation and the Madison Fire department have a chlorine container leak stop kit known as a ?B Kit?.  In the event of a container leak the components from the kit can be installed to stop the leak. Any call to 911 will bring the resources of the Dane County Emergency Management.  They have prepared extensive plans to handle any chlorine release that may occur. \n \nMadison-Kipp personnel are also trained on chlorine safety and accident prevention. The largest supplier of chlorine in the state was hired to prepare a PSM  ?Process Safety Management? program for Madison-Kipp Corporation.  The PSM requires all levels of employees from VP, engineering, supervisors to hourly, be involved in the program.  Records are kept of all chlorine related process, maintenance and system changes.  If a change is to be made to the system a meeting is held, and changes are presented.  Safety, emergency response and maintenance are addressed.  If all parties agree changes are made.  The PSM also has detailed operator instructions. When a container is hooked up all new seals are used each time.  After the connection is made the tank valve is opened a small amount and then"
