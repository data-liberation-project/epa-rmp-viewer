The alternative scenario for a covered Program 3 process must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis identifies that the facility\u0092s worst-case release scenario for Program 1 flammables (e.g., butane) involves a release from a single storage trailer. The scenario assumes that 12,677 pounds of butane is released, the entire amount vaporizes within 10 minutes, and the total quantity is involved in a vapor cloud explosion. The distance at which the explosion overpressure equals the regulatory endpoint of one pound per square inch (psi) was determined to be 0.20 miles. No public or environmental receptors were identified in this scenario.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis identifies that the facility\u0092s worst-case release scenario for Program 3 flammables involves a release from the largest single storage container of propane. The scenario assumes the entire propane storage quantity of 208,800 pounds is released, the entire amount vaporizes within 10 minutes, and the total quantity is involved in a vapor cloud explosion. The distance at which the explosion overpressure equals the regulatory endpoint of one pound per square inch (psi) was determined to be 0.50 miles. Residences and commercial/industrial areas were identified as public receptors within the affected area, but no environmental receptors were identified within the worst-case distance to the endpoint. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a safety relief valve failure, which causes overpressure or overfill of a propane bulk storage tank that results in a vapor cloud explosion. The scenario estimated a release rate of 1,938 pounds per minute for five minutes, based on a standard cubic feet per minute flowrate of a four-valve 2.5\u0094 multiport re"

Worthington exceeds the threshold quantities for each of the listed substances and is therefore required to develop and implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under 40 CFR 68. The RMP must also be submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using the RMP*eSubmit program found under EPA\u0092s Central Data Exchange (CDX) online submittal platform.\n\nThe purpose of this written RMP is to provide updates to a previously written plan prepared by Foth in 2019. Updated information includes new facility contacts, updated regulated substance quantities, storage locations, updated process program level determinations, as well as updates required by the RMP Reconsideration Rule. \n\nBased on an evaluation performed by Foth, in conjunction with Worthington personnel, it was determined that the facility\u0092s process associated with butane meets Program Level 1 criteria and the facility\u0092s process associated with propane and propylene meets Program Level 3 criteria. \n\nBased on the EPA\u0092s General Risk Management Program Guidance, a facility shall conduct one worst-case analysis to qualify a process for Program 1. Additionally, one worst-case analysis and one alternative release scenario is to be conducted for all processes involving Program 3 flammables. An alternative scenario analysis is not required for each flammable substance above the threshold. \n\nFor the worst-case scenario involving a release of a regulated flammable substance, the facility must assume that the quantity of the flammable substance is released into a vapor cloud and that a vapor cloud explosion results. Additionally, they must estimate the distance to an endpoint to an overpressure level of one pound per square inch (psi) from the explosion of the vapor cloud.

The facility manufactures steel canisters and cylinders which are then filled with a mixture of flammable gases consisting of propane and propylene. Bulk delivery of propane and propylene occurs by either commercial truck or tanker rail car. The gases are transferred to bulk storage tanks prior to the container filling process. Facility warehouses store bulk quantities of flammable gas-filled canisters and cylinders prior to offsite shipment.
