      "SummaryText": "Platinum Ethanol, LLC, referred to as PLE herein, is a newly constructed facility.  Since PLE is a new facility, the reports and information relevant to this Plan are recently developed.  All included reports and information were reviewed and approved by PLE management prior to the start up of the facility.  There has never been a change in management; therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nPlatinum Ethanol, LLC is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents.  These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nIt is PLE's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nPlatinum Ethanol, LLC ethanol plant is located near Arthur, Ida County, Iowa.\n\nPLE manufactures fuel grade ethanol from corn operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  The substances regulated under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Natural Gas, known as Denaturant at the facility.  With the amount of Anhydrous Ammonia stored on-site, PLE has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles.  The radius of impact from a worst-case release of Denaturant would be 0.8 miles.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA:\n\nA release of 96,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which would create a toxic vapor cloud, is the worst-case scenario at the facility.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release of the entire Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the facility.  There are approxi"

      "SummaryText": "mately 2,075 residential receptors within the 5.6 mile radius.  Other public receptors include schools and hospitals.  Environmental receptors within the radius include Odebolt Creek, Maple River, Hoskins Creek, Elk Creek and agricultural lands.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR DENATURANT:\n\nA release of 875,000 pounds of denaturant, which would create a vapor cloud explosion, is the worst-case scenario at PLE.  A release of the entire denturant tank would be worst-case scenario for the facility.  The vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.80 mile radius from the center of the facility.  These receptors include residences as well as schools.  Environmental receptors within the radius include Odebolt Creek and agricultural land.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nSince the facility is a newly constructed ethanol facility, Platinum Ethanol, LLC is subject to RMP upon delivery of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\n\nPLE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health & Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility will conduct employee training as part of the facility activities.  The importance of worker, public and environmental safety is reflected in Platinum Ethanol, LLC's plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and review of the facility's emergency response plan is pending."
