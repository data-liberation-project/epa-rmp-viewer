      "SummaryText": " of water treatment, in simple terms, is the addition of a substance called a coagulant to change the electrical charge of the water so we can form a heavier substance that will envelope undesirable elements and fall to the bottom of a basin designed for settling.\n\nOne of the processes we use is a disinfection process.  Water-borne diseases, bacteria, viruses, and cysts can live and grow in water so we disinfect to kill these undesirables.  The disinfectant we use is chlorine.  Chlorine will kill almost any living creature and is a very effective disinfectant because of that.  \nBecause chlorine can be so deadly, we take great care in how we handle and store chlorine.  Chlorine is shipped to us on flat-bed trucks.  The trucks carry cylinders that hold 2000 pounds of liquid chlorine.  Each container has been thoroughly inspected and certified by the chemical manufacturer before it was filled with chlorine. We normally would have no more than four full cylinders on hand at any one time.\nThe chlorine takes the form of gas in the upper parts of the cylinders and that is what we use to mix with water to create a chlorine disinfecting dose to add to the water.\nWe store the cylinders in a room that was specially designed to house the cylinders.  Every precaution has been taken to insure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nChlorine gas can be deadly. Chlorine is heavier than air and therefore will seek the lowest levels of terrain.  Chlorine is a yellowish gas and will burn the skin, eyes and mucous membranes.  It will severely damage lungs, possibly causing death.  \n\nMINIMAL DISCHARGE - This type of discharge would be only a small amount of chlorine gas escaping during routine cylinder exchange.  The amount of chlorine discharged would not exceed a 15 second release of 5/8\" tubing.  \n\nThis release scenario has no offsite impact.  The release is completely contained and will not cause pr"
