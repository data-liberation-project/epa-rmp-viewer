The majority of the ammonia produced at the Yazoo City facility is used to make nitrogen fertilizers. It is these nitrogen fertilizers that feed the plants that in turn feed and clothe the world's population. In addition to ammonia, chlorine is utilized at the facility as a disinfectant in the plant's potable water and cooling water systems.\r\n\r\nAmong the many other things that Terra brings to its community is a commitment to operate safely. The company recognizes the health concerns of its neighboring community and is committed to responding to those concerns. A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel. Terra employees continuously look for ways to operate and maintain the production facilities in a safe manner. Terra participates in routine safety training programs and drills. In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensure that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nTerra has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together we are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility. To ensure proper emergency preparedness, Terra has several teams of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialties. \r\n\r\nTerra's safety and environmental record reflects the company's commitment. We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection integrated into our daily operations at our plants to protect our employees and the community. The following identifies some primary layers of protection:\r\n\r\n   * Managing risk is something we do on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n   * We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\r\n\r\n   * Our employees are highly skilled and well-trained.\r\n\r\n   * Our equipment is rountine"

This information is maintained in the workplace.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nTerra conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is known as the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a maintenance turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTerra has a comprehensive training program to inform and educate employees to ensure they are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nTerra carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment during each operational maintenance turnaround to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, turbines, compressors, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with training in maintenance practices. Futhermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nProposed changes are evaluated for potential impact in the areas of safety, regulatory, etc., before being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to indentify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nTerra believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Terra's releases in the last five years have been typically very small releases to the air and do not meet the criteria stipulated in the regulations.\r\n\r\nTerra has an extensive emergency response program. Specific to the facility, there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, personal injury or fatality, and equipment failures.\r\n\r\nThe plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities.
