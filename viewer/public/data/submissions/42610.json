To ensure employee and public safety, we have instituted programs to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  We comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management program.  This program controls all aspects of our ammonia system operation.  Policies and procedures cover everything from system maintenance to employee training.  The contractors that work on our systems must meet or exceed our qualification guidelines.  We only allow trained and authorized employees to operate and maintain our systems.  To reduce the possibility of accidents, we only allow trained and authorized employees to operate our powered industrial trucks.  With the assistance of local agencies, we have developed plans to respond to emergencies at our facility.  These plans include the methods we would use to notify the public in the event of an emergency.  We are proud ofour system's safety record and our place in the community.  We look forward to our future as a good corporate neighbor."
