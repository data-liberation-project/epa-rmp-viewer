(SupHerb Farms) prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) for its Turlock plant in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSupHerb prepared the RMP/PSM Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia and chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, SupHerb Farms has written an Emergency Action Plan and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team. SupHerb will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM Program.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSupHerb Farms i"

This facility processes herbs and specialty vegetables by freezing and/or other processing.  Fresh herbs and specialty vegetables are processed through an Instant Quick Freeze (IQF) tunnel. Frozen herbs are packaged for wholesale markets or processed through a paste line. Cold storage is also provided within the warehouse for holding packaged final products. The NAICS Code for the facility is 311411 Frozen Fruit, Juice, and Vegetable Manufacturing.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) is the regulated substance used in the facility's refrigeration system. The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 19,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling to the cold storage rooms, and processing lines. The cold rooms are used to store finished products ready for shipping.\n\n \n\nChlorine is utilized as a biocide to disinfect the process water in the facility.  The source of chlorine for the chlorination system during normal operation is a one-ton container.  A one-ton container may be on site, resulting in a maximum chlorine inventory of 2,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the SupHerb Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized "

      "SummaryText": "herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe CALARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. SupHerb Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The SupHerb Farms ammonia system has safeties and cutouts that shut down pump components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the ammonia system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.  The pressure relief valves discharge into a diffusion tank of adequate capacity. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine system is, for the most part, under less than atmospheric pressure with only the ton container and vacuum regulator operated at above atmospheric pressure.  The vacuum regulator will shut off chlorine flow if vacuum is lost anywhere in the delivery piping.\n\n\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\n?    Ammonia leak detection in engine room\n\n?    Chlorine release detection in incoming vegetable wash line area\n\n?    Remote emergency shutdown switch\n\n?    Fire sprinklers indoors throughout the facility\n\n?    component specific safety shutdowns\n\n\n\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine systems at the facility, SupHerb Farms has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the systems. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lock out / tag"

Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are prepared for the ammonia and chlorine systems at the facility. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\n\n\nSupHerb Farms is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine systems. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe CALARP/RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. SupHerb Farms has had no reportable accidental releases of ammonia or chlorine during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSupHerb Farms has a written Emergency Response (Action) Plan (EAP) that identifies emergency personnel responsibilities, procedures, evacuation measures and reporting requirements. The EAP is considered an action plan, not a response to mitigate the release. The EAP does not provide for release mitigation by facility employees. The facility relies on outside support for mitigation of an ammonia release. This support would be provided by the Turlock Fire Department and Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response Team.

The Incident Commander will have the responsibility of notifying other agencies concerning the incident. The Incident Commander will have the responsibility for any first aid rendered at the site. A copy of the ERP will be kept with the RMP documentation.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSupHerb Farms has revalidated its Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia and chlorine in 2014 and has received a new list of suggested mitigating measures.  SupHerb Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly and has established completion schedules for proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with SupHerb Farms commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations. Current changes being evaluated include:\n\n?    Ensuring that the signage is correct at engine room doors\n\n?    Possibility of adding corrosion protection element to annual maintenance inspection\n\n?    Evaluation of the need for more bollards around a condenser support structure\n\n?    Evaluate the need for a chain operator for a difficult to reach condenser valve\n\n\n\nSupHerb Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as SupHerb Farms continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community.
