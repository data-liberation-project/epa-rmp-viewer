We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors, and protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities at LBC Houston, up to and including:\n*  A description of our facility and the storage and transfer of chemicals;\n*  Accidental release prevention program;\n*  Five year accidental release of regulated chemicals;\n*  Emergency Response Program; and\n*  Planned and implemented improvements to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n \nLBC Houston is a public bulk liquid storage and transfer facility.  We are not a manufacturing or processing plant.  Chemicals, oils, and petroleum products are stored and transferred via tank trucks, rail cars, barges,pipelines and ships.  There is a number of regulated toxic and flammable chemicals which we are permitted (facility air permit based on health effects) to store but do not presently have on site.  Therefore, we are using predictive filing to include some regulated chemicals that are not currently handled on site but could be in the future.  A majority of the regulated flammable chemicals are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \nOur accidental release prevention program is a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n*  Process safety information.\n*  Process hazard analysis.\n*  Pre-startup review.\n*  Employee participation.\n*  Mechanical integrity.\n*  Operating procedures.\n* "

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We coordinate our plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC community response plan.\n\n\nPLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n \nThe following is a list of planned and implemented improvements to minimize accidental releases, thus improving safety:\n\n*  Maintain current standard operating procedures;\n*  Set minimum standards for equipment used in the storage and transfer of chemicals.\n*  Maintain tank truck and rail car pre-load and post-load inspection criteria.\n*  Improved training programs."
