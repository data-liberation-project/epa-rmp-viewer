Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSeadrift Operations of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both internal Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nUnion Carbide Seadrift Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces plastic and other chemical products in its various operating plants.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide and Dow processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Site, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\r\n\r\n Union Carbide Seadrift  Operations has the following RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances in quantities above the threshold: \r\n\r\nRMP Toxic Chemicals:  Ethylene Oxide, Ammonia, Vinyl Acetate, Propylene Oxide, Titanium Tetrachloride\r\nRMP Flammable Chemicals:  Butene-1, Ethylene, Isopentane, Methane, Propylene\r\n\r\n3.Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative relea"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\r\n\r\n1) Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\r\n2) Evacuation and shelter-in-place plans and accounting for personnel after an incident\r\n3) Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\r\n4) Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\r\n5) Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\r\n6) The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \r\n\r\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Calhoun County Emergency Planning Committee and the community.  A Mutual Aid Network has been established with Calhoun County and other local chemical plants to further enhance the ability to respond to an emergency.\r\n\r\n7.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Seadrift Site to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\r\n1) Complete the Layers of Protection Analysis for all affected plants and ensure the necessary layers are in place.\r\n2) Conduct periodic process hazard analyses for all p"
