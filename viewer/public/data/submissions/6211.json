The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCarson Energy Group's cogeneration facility, Carson Energy Cogeneration Plant is located at 8580 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA in Sacramento County. The cogeneration facility uses anhydrous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to control nitrogen emissions from the cogeneraton gas turbines. \n\nThe cogeneration facility is located just south of the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The facility comprises a 100-megawatt cogeneration power plant fueled by a combination of purchased natural gas and digester gas from the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant. There are 32 full-time employees at this site.  Anhydrous ammonia is received"

Ammonia vapor is injected into each of the two gas turbine exhaust ducts where it dissociates into free nitrogen and hydrogen under high temperature conditions and then re-combines with nitrogen oxides and oxygen under the influence of a catalyst to produce nitrogen gas and water vapor. The feed rate of ammonia is adjusted automatically, based on continuous emission monitors in the exhaust gas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Carson Energy Group that the receipt, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Carson Energy Group has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case anhydrous ammonia) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of 40,000 lb. of ammonia, the capacity of the bulk st"

This release scenario is not physically possible, due to the characteristics of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn \"alternative case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each toxic RS handled in quantities greater than the threshold quantity at the site.\n\nThe \"alternative case\" scenario is described in the ARP regulations as a likely release resulting in offsite effects, considering administrative controls and mitigation measures in place, and is to be determined by the facility operators as part of the Process Hazard Analysis required to be performed during RMP development.  The \"alternative case\" considered for this facility is the release of liquid anhydrous ammonia from a ruptured hose during transfer at the rate of 45 gpm, the capacity of the excess flow valve on the bulk storage tank, with the release secured by properly trained and equipped responders by shutting the valve on the tank side of the hose break after 10 minutes. \n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Carson Energy Group which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include Carson Energy Group's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel following established emergency operation and emergency response procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental releas"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Carson Energy Group's operations. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to anhydrous ammonia have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, the creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCarson Energy Group's Emergency Response Program applicable to anhydrous ammonia has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with Carson Energy Group personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Carson Energy Group committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.
