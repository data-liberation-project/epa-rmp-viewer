As part of this commitment, we have established a process safety management system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at our facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with having hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs (EPAA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mosaic  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\r\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule \r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule\r\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule\r\nInformation further describing our risk management program is provided in this executive summary.\r\nAlthough our risk management program helps ensure that our facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program.

We provide emergency response training to our personnel so that they are well prepared to handle emergency situations and execute emergency response actions.\r\n2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCES WE STORE\r\nWe store anhydrous ammonia in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule in one of our manufacturing processes.  Anhydrous ammonia is covered as a toxic material by the RMP rule.\r\n3.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nWe have always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, we incorporated this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA\u00bfs (OSHAA\u00bfs) process safety management (PSM) regulation.  For Riverview Mosaic, the prevention program requirements of EPAA\u00bfs RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM regulation.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements. \r\n3.1  Prevention Program\r\nOur accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n1.\tProcess safety information.  We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\r\n2.\tProcess hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze"

When we must use a hazardous substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\r\nPreventing releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to mitigate and stop the release. We work closely with the Hillsborough County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.  Our safety program consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\r\n1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  We take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of our processes.\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, we will"

We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n7.\tPre-startup safety review.  We recognize that new or newly modified processes are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.  This review confirms that:\r\nA\u00bf\tConstruction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\nA\u00bf\tAdequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\r\nA\u00bf\tEmployee training has been completed\r\nA\u00bf\tFor a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\r\n8.\tCompliance audit.

We investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\r\n10.\tEmployee participation.  We have a written employee participation program for our covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of our workers are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\r\n11.\tHot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHAA\u00bfs fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nOur accident history demonstrates the continuous safe operation of our chemical processes over the last 5 years.  There were no accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury or illness to employees or the public in the past 5 years.\r\n5.
