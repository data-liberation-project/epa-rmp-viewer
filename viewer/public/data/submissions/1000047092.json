It is the stated policy of Addivant to safely manage our site operations.  In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.  The Morgantown, West Virginia facility is a certified Responsible Care facility.  Responsible Care is a technical standard for management of Environmental, Health, Safety and Security risks associated with our operations.  \n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Environmental Health, Safety and Security Manager at (304) 284-2380 or Environmental Engineer at 304-284-2214..\n\n\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical production facilities everywhere we do business.  Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\n\n\n\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the Addivant Morgantown facility utilizes certain raw materials in its manufacturing processes that are classified as toxic or flammable.  We are committed to comply with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation.  Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, if a major release does occur, our tr"

The facilities are referred to as the North Plant and the South Plant.  Both plants were built in 1965 and currently employ about 110 people in the Morgantown area.  Addivant manufactures millions of pounds of antioxidant chemicals marketed under trade names such as ULTRANOX(R);, WESTON(R);, and others.  Our products are used in various plastics, inks, coatings, and adhesives for improved ultraviolet (UV) heat, color, and processing stability.\n\n\n\nThis site is also home to a Technology Center, where Addivant conducts advanced research in specialty chemical technology.\n\n\n\n4.0  Hazard Assessment Results\n\n\n\nAs part of our risk management planning, we have specifically identified the type of event that, should it ever occur, would have the most negative impacts on our workers and our neighbors.  This is known as the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS).  As defined by EPA, we are required to assume that the numerous engineering and administrative safety controls we have in place to prevent or mitigate such accidents have all failed at once.  EPA defines a worst-case scenario as a catastrophic failure, which is an event that essentially results in the instantaneous release of the contents in the largest single vessel on-site of a regulated RMP chemical.\n\nA worst-case and alternative release scenario were developed for the North and South Plants using the RMP Comp software and ALOHA software.  The scenarios predicted the endpoint for each release scenario based upon the data input.\n\n\n\n5.0  General Accidental Release Prevention/Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAddivant has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (PSM).

PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\n\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features to prevent chemical accidents include:\n\n-Computer controlled safety systems on the phosphorous trichloride storage and transfer systems to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n\n-Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\n-Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks and tank truck unloading areas to contain a spill;\n\n-Building enclosures around phosphorous trichloride tank truck unloading and storage equipment to contain a leak;\n\n-Both the unloading and storage building enclosures are equipped with a water deluge system that can be readily connected to a water supply to mitigate the release of vapors from the building;\n\n-Phosphorous trichloride liquid is transferred through a double-walled or \"pipe-within-a-pipe\" system to prevent leaks to the atmosphere;\n\n-Phosphorous trichloride piping system is equipment with electronic sensors to detect a leak within inner piping system;\n\n-General area gas sensors are located within both the storage and unloading buildings to detect and warn of a release of phosphorous trichloride during the transfer or storage; \n\n-Chemical Operators are present during the unloading and transfer of phosphorus trichloride; \n\n-Both the unloading and storage building are under continuous video surveillance with the monitors being located in within two separate control rooms (i.e., 181 and 183 Control Rms);\n\n-Extensive safety information about the processes is reviewed with employees through our company's H"

Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  EPA requires that all incidents involving RMP-regulated chemicals that resulted in any off-site impact or  on-site impacts as defined by the RMP rules are reported in this document.  \n\n\n\nDuring the previous five-year period only one such incident has occurred at the plant site.

All of our employees are trained in the proper response to an incident.  We also invest in the equipment needed to respond to on-site emergencies.  Our response team work with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Monongalia County area.  For example, past emergency drills, organized and directed by Addivant emergency teams, have included:\n\n-A simulated liquid waste incident completed in September 1996 with Monongalia County Emergency officials, and police departments from the City of Westover, West Virginia; \n\n-A simulated chemical tanker truck incident with Monongalia County Emergency services conducted during January 1997; \n\n-A simulated phosphorus trichloride incident and community-wide drill with the Westover Volunteer Fire Department, Monongalia Emergency Services and area hospitals during June 1998. \n\n-Participated in the Morgantown Mock Disaster Drill, West Virginia Regional Response Team in October 2002. \n\n-Completed onsite drill in 2008 with plant emergency response team and medical team simulating spill/release.\n\n-Completed training with City of Westover Volunteer Fire Department on two separate occasions in 2008.\n\n-Facility completes quarterly headcount drills\n\n-Hosted monthly meeting with members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee May 2009.\n\nOngoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident.\n\nInformation about how to shelter yourself and your family in the event of a chemical emergency can be found in the local telephone directory and on the Monongalia County Office of "
