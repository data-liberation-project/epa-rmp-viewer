      "SummaryText": "The managerial policy for accidental release prevention of chlorine encompasses engineering and administrative controls and, standard operating procedures for delivery, storage and handling of chlorine.\nThe emergency response policies at this stationary source are encompassed by the Facility's Emergency Response Plan, Process Safety Management Plan and the Hazard Communication/Right to Know Plan. In addition to facility staff training, periodic training with the City of Olean Fire Department, which is the official response agency for uncontrollable releases, is provided.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is a stationary source whose primary activity is treating mixed domestic and industrial wastewater. Chlorine is used to disinfect sewage effluent. Through administrative control, a maximum of 10,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on site.The chlorination system operates by vacuum rather than pressure to minimize the potential for a catastrophic release. Chlorine detection devices and alarms are routinely inspected and tested as is all other equipment associated with the chlorination process. Chlorine is the only substance used at this facility that meets the threshold quantity per OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is one in which 2000 pounds are released at 200 pounds per minute. The release is mitigated by enclosure which limits impact distance to 0.9 miles.\nThe most likely alternative release scenario is one in which a 7/16 inch cylinder valve is broken. This creates a leak rate of 28.5 pounds per minute. Through mitigation by enclosure and City of Olean Fire Department stopping the release in 30 minutes, impact is limited to a distance of 0.1 mile.\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the Facility Emergency Response Plan, shared ressponse responsibilities and training with the Olean Fire Department and coordination with Cattaraugus Count"
