This program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and other matters addressed in the federal standard.\nOur program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions\nof the standard.  We shall, at a minimum: 1) consult with employees or their representatives on the conduct and \ndevelopment of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and 2) provide to our employees\nor their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that\nstandard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Reponse Policies\nThe City of Waco belives that preventive maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.  The City of Waco has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Subatances\nThe Riverside Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine and liquid ammonium sulfate for disinfection of the trated water.  The maximum inventory for chlorine is 22,000 pounds, in one-ton cylinders.  The chlorine is stored in a building (passive mitigation) with a one-ton capacity scrubber.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe City of Waco has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.  This program includes: safe"

It is Waco's philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  The City of Waco incorporates the RMP elements into other areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the system.  \n\nTHE PURPOSE OF THIS SUBMISSION IS TO UPDATE PROCESS INFORMATION (not using anhydrous ammonia anymore)."
