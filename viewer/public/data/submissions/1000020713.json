For this facility, we have made our calculation based on hose rupture \n           during load-out thru a 1inch fill line and a simultaneous emergency excess flow valve fails  to close \n           during rapid flow rate changes associated with the hose rupture.  The distance to endpoint (point of \n           dispersion to 200 ppm) is .4 miles (2112 ft.) based on average of rural and agricultural topography \n           from the DEGADIS modeling charts.  Since this filling process is always supervised by an \n           employee, we calculate maximum time of escape to be two (2) minutes before a secondary shut-off \n           measure can be initiated.\n\n4.

The Facility Policy\n\n          The owners, management, and employees of Kova Ag Products @ Burnettsville are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n          -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to area farmers.\n          - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area farmers as a vital crop\n             production nutrient (nitrogen).\n          -The maximum amount stored at this facility would be 53,000 pounds (10,200 gallons) in our 12,000 \n            gallon storage tanks.  Product is routinely loaded into 1000 gallon mobile tanks for pick-up by and \n            sale to area farmers.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n      a. The worst case scenario for this facility would be the release of the total contents one of the two \n          12,000 gallon storage tank as a gas over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum quantity released \n          would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent \n          capacity as limited by design standards, industry recommendations, and company policy.  The \n          distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) has been calculated for this community \n          as 1.3 miles using the average of rural and agricultural from modeling data charts.\n      b.
