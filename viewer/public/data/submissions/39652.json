This program continues the City of El Dorado\u00bfs commitment to the protection of its employees and the control of the potential for such a release.  To date, no such release has occurred at the plant. The complete PSM program is summarized in Appendix A. This summary was submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as required by Federal regulation.\n1.1 Program Summary\nThe program described herein supplements the procedures described in other City documents such as general administrative guidelines and safety and health manuals. The PSM program addresses the City of El Dorado\u00bfs program management procedures, process safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, employee training, safe work practices, contractor safety, and emergency response. Each topic has its own chapter in this program document. Most management elements of the program appear in Section 2 of this document. Process safety information describing the hazards and physical properties of chlorine, as well as safe operating limits and a description of the major process equipment is included in Section 3.\n1.2 Process Hazard Review\nA process hazard review was conducted for each regulated process. The hazard review team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts, and outside process design engineers. The hazard review team used a \"What-If\" technique. The product of that review appears as Section 4 of this program document.\n1.3 Training \nThe City of El Dorado has implemented a training program with regular and structured plant training in operations, maintenance, and safety for WTP employees. Training record forms document the required training. The training records for all personne"

The training program appears as Section 5 of this program.\n1.4 Operating Procedures\nThe City has adopted standard operating procedures (SOPs) that provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine system. The procedures are presented in Section 6 and address startup, shutdown, inspections, temporary operation, emergency procedures, and troubleshooting. Maintenance SOPs appears in Section 7 along with other safe work practices for handling chlorine and for working in and around chlorine facilities.\n1.5 Emergency Response Program\nAn Emergency Response Procedure documents the measures the City will take to control process upsets and chlorine releases. The Emergency Response Procedure appears as Section 8 in this program.\n1.6 Organization of the Document\nThis PSM document is organized by chapters, each chapter covering a primary element of the PSM process. All tables and figures are included at the back of each chapter. In addition, various appended exhibits (forms, policies, technical information, etc.) are also at the back of each chapter. This organization allows for each chapter, or PSM element, to act as a stand alone portion for ease in reference and use. Throughout the PSM document there are words or phrases in bold italics, which denote items of importance."
