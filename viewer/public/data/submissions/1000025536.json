Bayway Chemical Plant\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Infineum USA L.P.Bayway Chemical Plant has had a long-standing commitment to protecting their employees, the public, and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as: providing comprehensive initial and refresher personnel training, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes, and conducting drills to respond to simulated emergencies. Our objective is to implement controls to minimize the potential for releases.  However, if a release occurs, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the leak.\n\n\n\nWe prevent accidents using a structured safety management system entitled OIMS, Operations Integrity Management Systems, and a Total Safety Culture in which all employees play a role in the prevention of incidents.  Our Operations Integrity Management Systems are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from our hazard reviews and any incident investigations.\n\n\n\nThe Bayway Chemical Plant has been recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a VPP STAR Facility (Voluntary Protection Program - Safety Through Accountability and Recognition) for its effective safety and health management programs.  Our plant has also mentored four other Linden businesses in achieving this select status.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Infineum Bayway Chemical Plant, located in Linden, N. J., operates several processes to produce additives for engine oils and transmission fluids.  While the additive products are not regulated as hazardous by the EPA,"

Our flammable materials are: mixed C4 hydrocarbons (butane and butenes) and mixed C3 hydrocarbons (propane and propylene).  Our regulated toxic materials are: ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and vinyl acetate.  \n\n \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe plant uses a structured Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS), which covers all aspects of our operations that could affect the safety or health of our employees or public neighbors.  This system was developed by ExxonMobil Chemical Company in 1992.  Although the plant became part of a new company, Infineum, in 1999, OIMS continues to be the formal Operations Integrity System at the Bayway Chemical Plant.  In 2006, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance (LRQA) reviewed the practice of the site OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001).  After an extensive review, Lloyd's concluded that the \"design of the environmental components of OIMS has embraced the intent behind ISO 14001 and has addressed all of the individual ISO 14001 system elements.  They went on to say, \"at the Bayway Chemical Plant, individuals at all levels demonstrated a high level of personal commitment to OIMS implementation.  It is the opinion of Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance that the environmental management components of Infineum's OIMS have addressed all the requirements of ISO 14001:2004\". \n\n\n\nThe OIMS system meets all the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA Risk Management Program, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.  The system also exceeds all regulatory requirements by incorporating periodic management review of performance measurements for each practice to evaluate whether each practice is working as planned and what improvements might be made. The Infineum Bayway Chemical Plant received OSHA VPP STAR status in 1994 and was re-certified in 1997"

Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly being updated. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nInfineum encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. An annual plan is developed for employee participation.  This includes weekly safety meetings for operations and maintenance personnel, weekly safety audits, meetings of the Operations Integrity Committee (OIC) and most recently, site-wide, day long, interactive safety workshops.  Employees also participate in the development and updating of operating and maintenance procedures and conducting Process Hazard Analyses (PHA).  PHA's are also reviewed by the OIC, the results are available to employees, and follow-up is stewarded by the OIC.\n\n\n\nThe OIC reports directly to the plant manager and is the final review on \"safety\" matters relating to facilities and operations.  \"Safety,\" in the current environment, encompasses a broad range of issues.  Not only is it necessary to provide for the well-being of the plant workers and equipment, but also to protect the community from any harm resulting from an in-plant incident.

HAZOP analysis is widely recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough PHA techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team also makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they might be appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are provided to local management for resolution.  Implementation of prevention/mitigation steps in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.
