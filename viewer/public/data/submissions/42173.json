A process hazard analysis and risk assesment review is conducted every 5 years by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Maintenance Supervisor and Operating personnel. The total process experience of these individuals exceeds 60 years. Operating procedures are written and tracked by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and the Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is formulated and tracked by the Water Treatment Plant Plant Superintendent and Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is accomplished in the classroom and on the job by the Operator Training Commmittee which consists of supervisory personnel and certified EHS operators. Understanding of the training is assured by written tests, oral tests, and demonstration. Training is tracked by a database and hardcopy records. The mechanical maintenance program is delegated to the Assistant Plant Superintendent. The program consists of equipment list and specifications, equipment history, preventative maintenance procedures, and a demand work order system. The equipment history is analyzed periodically for equipment reliability. The management of change program is assured by the Assistant"
