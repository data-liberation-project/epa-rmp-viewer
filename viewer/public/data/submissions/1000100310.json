Delta Terminal Services stores a variety of chemicals ranging from vegetable oils to volatile organic substances. \r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Delta Terminal has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by resources invested in accident prevention, ongoing worker training, and consideration of safety in design, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release. \r\n\r\nThis facility is regulated under the Program 2 rule requirements of 40 CFR 68.10 because:\r\n\r\n- It maintains storage inventories of Ethylenediamine(EDA), a listed toxic chemical, in excess of 20,000 lbs (the regulatory threshold as defined by 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G)\r\n\r\n- A release from the Kinder Morgan Delta Terminal could impact off-site receptors (i.e., residences and business areas)\r\n\r\n- Kinder Morgan Delta Terminal does not operate under a SIC code specified for Program 3 rule\r\n\r\n- It is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (\"PSM\" at 29 CFR 1919.119) \r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Delta Terminal is subject to and complies with OSHA Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38), OSHA Emergency Response (29 CFR 1910.120), the Clean Water Act (40 CFR 112), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Regulations, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to Know Act (EPCRA).\r\n\r\nThe"

The liquid temperature for the worst case scenario for Tank 50-21 was changed from 77 F to 94 F, so that the ambient temperature is based on a three year maximum daily temperature.  This change caused the worst case release endpoint radius to increase from 0.7 miles to 1.1 miles, and the affected population to increase from 3125 persons to 13,518 persons.  Other corrections were made to the contact information and the executive summary.\r\n\r\nThe January 2013 RMP resubmittal is to add toluene diisocyanate (TDI) to the RMP as a new covered chemical which will be received, stored and shipped in drums only.  There is no change to the worst-case toxic release scenario as a result of this resubmittal. An alternative-case scenario for TDI has been included per the requirements.\r\n\r\nThe October 2013 RMP resubmittal is a voluntary submittal to add additional storage capacity of Ethylenediamine (EDA) of 1,572,900 pounds, in Storage Tank 50-12, which of the same nominal capacity as Tank 50-21.  Comparative RMP*Comp evaluation of each tank demonstrated that the worst case release endpoint and affected population do not change as a result of adding the additional storage capacity.\r\n\r\nThe June 2014 RMP resubmittal is a voluntary submittal to add additional storage capacity of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) of 9,772,822 pounds, in Storage Tank 250-1.  Modeling of this worst-case release scenario, as well as that for EDA, has been updated utilizing the SAFER model in order to provide more accurate release modeling.  As a result of this updated modeling, there is no offsite impact for TDI; the affected population for the worst-case release of EDA is now 1,873 persons.\r\n\r\nThe July 2015 RMP resubmittal is a voluntary submittal to add additional storage capacity of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) of 5,734,217 pounds, in Storage Tank 150-12.

This additional storage capacity was planned but never implemented.  This submittal also provides minor updates (reductions) in maximum inventory of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and EDA due to storage tank safe fill limitations.  No change to the worst case release endpoint or affected population will result from these minor reductions in maximum inventory.\r\n\r\nThis voluntary submittal also revises the CAS number of TDI based on the composition of the material being stored.  Previously the variant Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate [Benzene, 2,4-diisocyanato-1-methyl-], CAS # 584-84-9, was stored.  This is changed to Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-], CAS # 26471-62-5.  There is no difference in toxic endpoint for these two variants of TDI.\r\n\r\nThis voluntary submittal also updates Prevention Program information in Section 8 and Emergency Response information in Section 9.\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no RMP accidents in the past five (5) years.\r\n\r\nThe May 2017 RMP resubmittal is a voluntary submittal to revise the most recent agency inspection date.  There are no other changes in this submittal.\r\n\r\nThe July 2017 RMP resubmittal is a voluntary submittal to revise the worst-case scenarios for both TDI and EDA, and the alternative case release scenarios for both TDI and EDA.  It also revises the inventory levels for both TDI and EDA, and the release volume for the EDA worst-case scenario to account for product held in the tank system piping.
