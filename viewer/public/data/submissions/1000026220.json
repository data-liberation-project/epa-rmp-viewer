FHR's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Longview facility is operated by FHR to offload propylene from rail cars and store it until use by a neighboring plant.\r\n\r\nThe facility consists of three double-sided rail car unloading racks (six offloading spots total), a storage tank, compressor system, and associated piping and instrumentation.  Railcars are offloaded into the storage tank and propylene is transferred via pump from the storage tank into a DOT pipeline which transfers propylene to the neighboring plant.\r\n\r\nThere are no EPA RMP regulated toxic chemicals used at the facility.  Propylene is the only RMP regulated flammable material present in amounts greater than the threshold quantity that is used or stored at the Longview facility. The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by FHR.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf Operating in compliance with required environmental p"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have all helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\nMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\r\n\u00bf Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\r\n\u00bf Minimizing the possibility of a release of propylene with shutdown interlocks installed on process equipment.\r\n\u00bf Reducing the severity of fires with operation of automatic sprinkler and manual deluge systems.\r\n\u00bf Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms and/or indicators on the storage tank.\r\n\u00bf Implementing operating procedures for unloading and transfer operations.\r\n\u00bf Installing combustible gas detectors in the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\t\r\nWithin the last five years, there have been no releases of propylene that resulted in onsite injuries, death or property damage or any offsite impacts\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\t\r\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordi"
