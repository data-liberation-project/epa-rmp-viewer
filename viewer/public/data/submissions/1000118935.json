(OFS)\nNINE MILE PLANT\nLeedey, Oklahoma\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Nine Mile Gas Plant (Facility) has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  ONEOK Field Services, LLC (OFS) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees.  Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the jobsite and to safeguard company property through preventative measures.  Employees of OFS are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies.  Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Nine Mile Gas Plant, located near Leedey, Oklahoma, utilizes a cryogenic processing unit to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).  As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the Facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate).  The Facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Nine Mile Gas Plant. The facility is classified as RMP Program L"

Since the facility was determined to be a Program Level 1 process, no alternative scenarios were considered. \n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Nine Mile Gas Plant involve hazards that must be managed for continued safe \noperation. Following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Nine Mile Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\u0095\tDaily operator inspection\n\u0095\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure sensors\n\u0095\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\u0095\tFacility is staffed 24-hours a day, 7-days a week\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\u0095\tProcess relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization\n\u0095\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\u0095\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n\u0095\tCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\u0095\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., backup pumps, etc.).\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\u0095\tTrained personnel in emergency action response plan (Response, Mitigation, ICS, Evacuation, etc.)\n\u0095\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., hard hat, safety glasses, FR protective clothing, etc.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Nine Mile Gas Plant was shut down in 2016. As a result, the facility experienced no reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Nine Mile Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance,"

      "SummaryText": "including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\nIn addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties, and participate in annual plant emergency drills to ensure emergency shutdown system (ESD) integrity and reinforce proper employee response.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant process.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Nine Mile Gas Plant has been coordinated with the Dewey County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, Police and Sheriff's office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to LEPC meetings, the facility conducts emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. The facility also provides annual refresher training to employees regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Nine Mile Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, audits and incident investigations. Safety training will be continued for all employees."
