This commitment is inherent in our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Chaves County LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n2  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nLeprino Foods Company (LFC) operates a cheese and whey manufacturing facility.  The plant is located at 5600 Omaha Road, Roswell, New Mexico.  LFC maintains one 112R listed substance in a regulated quantity on site.  Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7,  is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing process  The maximum intended physical inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia located at the LFC plant is approximately 87,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n3  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nLeprino Foods Co. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68.  The Ammonia refrigeration process is the only process at our facility that is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemi"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
