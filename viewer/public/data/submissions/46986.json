This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nUnivar is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries. Founded in 1924, the company supplies the food industry, pharmaceuticals, chemical compounders, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings, public utilities and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar is an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass the blending, repackaging, bulk and warehouse storage of chemicals, and their distribution to local industries via Univar?s fleet of delivery trucks or by one of our approved common carriers. One of the products stored and handled at our facility, ammonium hydroxide (Ammonia, concentration >20%), is subject to EPA?s Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68). This product is delivered to our facility by common carrier truck in sealed, UN Specification containers (55-gallon drums) and stored in our warehouse until distributed to end-use customers. We warehouse ammonium hydroxide in its original factory-packaged sealed containers, and do not open, use or repackage the material in any way prior to sale. We must maintain sufficient inventory of hydrofluoric aci"

A key requirement of EPA?s RMP rule is the preparation and submission of a Risk Management Plan, contained herein. The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\n3.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the general release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nUnivar maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is ?What If?. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA was performed on 05/10/2006.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Univar maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. The most recent revie"

All new or transferred employees receive their initial training within 90-days of hire. Refresher training is provided at various intervals, but typically between one and three years, depending on the subject matter.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nUnivar conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment at regularly scheduled intervals to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others, forklifts, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Univar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 05/10/2006. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Univar. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nUnivar conducts documented audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set forth in the RMP "

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nUnivar promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nUnivar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as apart of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Univar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor?s work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps undertaken at our facility include the following:\n|Maintaining minimal inventory\n|Developing Standard Operating Procedures on safe handling of the material and reviewing annually to ensure they are maintained current and up-to-date\n|Emergency response training and equipment to minimize the impact of a release \n|Storage and handling of the material in appropriate and sealed UN Specification containers, and in designated locations based on c"
