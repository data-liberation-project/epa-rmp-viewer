      "SummaryText": "The Andersons, Inc.\n\nSeymour Terminal\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n\n\nSource and Product Description\n\nThe Andersons Seymour Wholesale Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular). This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since June of 1999. The Operations Supervisor is Scott VonDielingen, and General Manager is Joe Reed.  Site management names and emergency contact information are posted on a sign at the entrance.\n\n\n\nThe facility occupies approximately 20 acres and is situated at the north end of Agrico Lane, south of M-50.  The facility is bordered to the south by an Indiana Department of Transportation (IDOT) maintenance facility, to the east by an agricultural field, to the north by railroad tracks and to the west by a lumber yard.\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP-regulated material involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  One 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tank.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not poisonous, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material, but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas and has a strong chemical affinity for water.  Therefore, an abundant supply of water is"

      "SummaryText": " our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\n\n\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\n\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck or railcar) to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the loading station to the nurse wagons.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\n\n\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow. \n\n\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \"events\" are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\n\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented\n\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Seymour facility are:\n\n?  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n\n?  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive "

      "SummaryText": "off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Seymour facility are:\n\n?  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n?  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\n\n?  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n\n?  An emergency shutoff which is a pneumatically activated valve and control buttons are located along the unloading station and at the east side of the control room shuts the plumbing off.\n\n?  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and an adjacent water well at each unloading point.\n\n?  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and "

The plan is intended to work in conjunction with the Emergency Action and Spill Control Plan to meet all required criteria.  All potential employee candidates are interviewed prior to hiring.  References may be verified depending on the level of familiarity with the person.\n\n\n\nMost full-time operations personnel have keys to the buildings.  Management controls key distribution.  There is no electronic security system at this location.  All buildings and vehicles are secured during non-business hours.\n\n\n\nThere are two 30,000 gallon bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tanks at the west end of the property in the Liquid Plant.  One of those tanks has been decommissioned.  Tank valves are locked when not in u se.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck.  Phosphoric acid is transported to the facility by railcar and staged at the tracks until product is transferred to the liquid fertilizer production area.  Inbound railcars are sealed, and these seals are inspected as part of the receiving process.  Broken seals would be reported to the railroad.\n\n\n\nInbound shipments of all products are inspected prior to storage or resale.  Any suspect product would be segregated and investigated.  Outbound shipments of hazardous materials would be accompanied by DOT shipping papers and placards, if necessary.  Any suspicious product sales or inquiries would be investigated by The Andersons Safety and Security Department and shared with local authorities.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable release of a RMP regulated chemical in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency procedures have been documented in the facility's Emergency "
