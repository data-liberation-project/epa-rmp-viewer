All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nVF Renewable Energy truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  VF Renewable Energy has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nVF Renewable Energy has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  This is a new facility, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response\nVF Renewable Energy has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of an emergency action plan, including evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties.  Our emergency action plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Grant County LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release preventio"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, VF Renewable Energy maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, startup after an emergency shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nVF Renewable Energy has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nVF Renewable Energy carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nVF Renewable Energy will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nVF Renewable Energy promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identi"

The goal of the digester plant is to reduce the negative impact of farming on the environment and on the community.  The facility takes manure from local farms and makes biogas that is upgraded to renewable natural gas.  \n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp program as well as the EPA \u0093Risk Management Program Guidance\u0094.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Plan that is located on site.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  The facility is subject to PSM and is subject to the Program 1 requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nVF Renewable Energy maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is a What If-Checklist and HAZOP.  The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operat"
