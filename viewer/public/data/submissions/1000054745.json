Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAssociated Grocers, Inc. is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment. Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our prevention program is the minimization of all risks that could possibly lead to an accidental release. This program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators. The Emergency Response Plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release. This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the St. George Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\n\n\n2.     The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAssociated Grocers, Inc. is a grocery distribution facility. The regulated substance handled at this plant is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the plant cooler and freezer system. \n\n\n\n3.     The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAssociated Grocers believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety. This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards. By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate at optimum condition. Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits. Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safety of Associated Grocers.\n\n\n\n4.     Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the last five years, the Associated Grocers facility has not experienced a significant accidental ammonia release.\n\n\n\n5.

Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings. To this end, Associated Grocers has coordinated emergency response effort with the St. George Fire Department and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release. Associated Grocers maintains a well trained emergency response team and has a written emergency response plan which specifies the details of the actions that will be taken in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n6.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAssociated Grocers will incorporate or address any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, Incident Investigations and Compliance Audits. The flexibility of the program allows Associated Grocers to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing Associated Grocers employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
