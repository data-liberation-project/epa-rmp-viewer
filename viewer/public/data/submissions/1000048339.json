We operate our business in a manner that conscientiously safeguards our employees, customers, and the community that we operate in.  In striving for responsible environmental, health and safety (EH&S) stewardship, Nederland Terminal pledges to:\n\n\n\n?    Diligently develop, construct, and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the priority on health and safety.\n\n?    Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state, and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances, and statutes as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n\n?    Continually measure, evaluate, and improve our EH&S performance.\n\n?    Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors, and vendors.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Nederland Terminal, located in Nederland, Jefferson County, Texas, is a large marine terminal that provides storage and distribution services for refiners and other large transporters of crude oil. The terminal receives, stores, and distributes crude oil, feedstocks, lubricants, petrochemicals, and bunker oils (used for fueling ships and other marine vessels) and also blends lubricants. \n\n\n\nThe storage capacity of three flammable chemicals (propane, n-butane, and propylene) exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability and is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements. There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\nNederland Terminal has developed a set of Management System procedures to manage implementation of the elements of the RMP program.  The management system details the scope, purpose, responsibilities and upkeep of each RMP element.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nNederland Terminal maintains permissible "

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidelines from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety. Nederland Terminal has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and the PHA will be revalidated and updated once every 5 years.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule the worst-case release scenario is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of one of the pipelines or storage equipment. The current version of the USEPA's RMP-Comp software was used in the analysis and the estimated release rates were calculated by the software with a release duration of 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, was conservatively analyzed by the same approach with vapor cloud explosion scenario. The USEPA's RMP-Comp version software was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, no public receptors would be affected by both scenarios.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nNederland Terminal maintains written operating procedures that address the vendors modes of process operations including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations, and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences deviation from the safe limits, and how t"

The procedures are readily available to operations personnel and are reviewed annually by team leaders.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll operating personnel at Nederland Terminal are initially trained in an overview of the operating and safety procedures.  Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.  In addition, all employees are given general awareness training on RMP and general emergency response.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nNederland Terminal documents and maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment through inspection and testing programs and through detailed maintenance documentation. Nederland Terminal also implements written procedures, training and construction assurance programs.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nNederland Terminal implements a program to prevent incidents caused by changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedure.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nNederland Terminal performs prestartup safety review on new or modified process facilities to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, that procedures and training have been implemented, and that hazardous analysis recommendations have been resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly Nederland Terminal will conduct a performance audit every three years. The plant will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nNederland Terminal will promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of flammable chemicals.  The findings of the investigation along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\n\nNederland Terminal develops a writt"

Nederland Terminal informs contractors working in or near the processes of all hazardous related to the work and the emergency action plan. \n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nNederland Terminal has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the related process, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identifiable equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at Nederland Terminal in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nNederland Terminal maintains a written defensive emergency response program.  The program addresses appropriate aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Jefferson County LEPC.\n\n"
