Because district number 170 is responsible for the operation, this plant is commonly referred to as the Harris County Municipal Utility District No. 170 (HCMUD #170).  The HCMUD #170 wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is operated by SouthWest Water Company (SWWC), a private company.\nBoth districts produce domestic wastewater.  District number 168 is primarily residential and produces the majority of the flow.  District number 170 includes commercial operations and a hospital.  The permitted average flow of the treatment plant is 2.5 mgd.  Treatment operations include bar screening, activated sludge with extended aeration, clarification, disinfection with chlorine, and de-chlorination using sodium bisulfate.\nHCMUD #170 and SWWC have reviewed its obligations under EPAA?s Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112 of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, HCMUD #170 and SWWC note the following obligations incumbent on the operations at the chlorine disinfection unit (also referred to as the chlorinator unit) at the WWTP.\n(1)    112 (1) A? Purpose and General Duty Claus A? The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  HCMUD #170 and SWWC take this obligation seriously, and intend to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness.  \n(2)    Risk Management Plan A? SWWC operates the WWTP, which stores and uses chlorine in excess of the threshold specified in the RMP Rule.  SWWC has developed and implemented programs to prevent any accidental release and training for emergency response in the event of"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nOnly one of the 140 chemicals on EPAA?s regulated substance list is stored at HCMUD #170 above the threshold.  This is the compressed liquid chlorine used in the disinfection process.  The maximum amount of chlorine contained onsite at any given time is 4,000 pounds.  This is stored in two one-ton cylinders.  The cylinders are located in the central part of the facility.  The threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.\nSWWC has implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate a chlorine release.  These include maintenance, training, and inspection procedures, as well as an Emergency Action Plan.\nHCMUD #170 and SWWC are committed to:\nA?Preventing accidents;\nA?Training employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\nA?Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\nA?Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\nA?Being a good corporate citizen of Harris County\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about the HCMUD #170 and SWWCA?s management of the risk associated with the chlorine disinfection process, but more importantly stresses the commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and community.\n"
