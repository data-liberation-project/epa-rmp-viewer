It is the WCF's policy to conduct its operations in accordance with the highest standards of environmental stewardship, employee and contractor safety and community responsibility. As part of this policy, the WCF has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the WCF and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at WCF. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the WCF.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWCF has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the public, its employees and contractors and to the preservation of the environment. One primary element of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. WCF utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a release, as a non-responding facility, WCF personnel are instructed to dial 911 to notify the Woodhaven Fire Department via telephone to respond and to mitigate the release. WCF has coordinated emergency response to the facility with the Woodhaven Fire Department. In conjunction with the Wayne County local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the Woodhaven Fire Department has the ability to notify the local community through media"

      "SummaryText": "broadcasting systems.\r\n\r\nMPL senior management is committed to high standards of Health, Environment, Safety and Security (HES&S) performance and, as such, has adopted a policy statement emphasizing the use of management systems to drive continual improvement in the following areas: accident prevention; prevention of pollution and resource conservation; communities; security and emergency preparedness; risk assessment; legislative and regulatory compliance; training and education; product stewardship; contractor performance; measurement of performance; continual improvement; and communication.  To help realize this policy, MPL has adopted the RC14001&reg; management system that adheres to a plan-do-check-adjust framework to assess risks, set targets and measure progress.  MPL's executive leadership team meets at least quarterly with key HES&S leaders throughout the company to evaluate performance and to discuss key strategic issues.  This forum, called the HES&S Management Committee, enables executive leadership to stay fully aware of pressing HES&S matters affecting the company and to ensure governance of the RC14001&reg; management system.\r\n\r\n1.2 WCF Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWCF is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility with eight underground solution-mined storage caverns and five major above ground LPG storage vessels. The storage caverns are used to store flammable mixtures, specifically butane and propane, for use in MPL's Michigan Refining Division, Detroit Refinery, or for LPG truck sales. The flammable mixtures are covered under the RMP rule and are present at the WCF above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nWCF has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nMPL performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment.

      "SummaryText": "onsequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. MPL does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like WCF. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC and Woodhaven Fire Department improve the community emergency response plan. We have submitted release scenarios to EPA, and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. Local residents and businesses who are interested in learning more about WCF's risk management plan should contact the Woodhaven Cavern Facility at (734) 676-7775 and ask for the Woodhaven Operations Supervisor.\r\n\r\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Woodhaven Cavern Facility. Because the process at the WCF that is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the WCF, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nWCF encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of WCF's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented"

WCF handles incidental releases with their own personnel. WFC's emergency action plan contains procedures for notifying the Woodhaven Fire Department of a release. To keep the emergency action plan current, WCF provides the Woodhaven Fire Department a facility tour and update briefing, typically on an annual basis, or when requested.\r\n\r\n1.8 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nWCF constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and soliciting safety suggestions from employees. WCF resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. The following changes are planned during the next 5 years:\r\n\r\nContinued upgrades to firewater system, automation of components, and supply\r\n\r\nUpgrades to facility control systems\r\n\r\nContinued upgrades to wellhead equipment to latest API 6A standards"

These initiatives include teams which promote both process and personal safety, such as the monthly Safety and Operations Meetings with management and hourly employees. Management groups typically have members with various areas of expertise, including operations, maintenance, and management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nWCF keeps a variety of technical documents at the WCF that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific WCF Operations personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the MPL Operations Manual and Data System (NOMADS) to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, WCF has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the WCF Operations Manual. WCF ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nWCF also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, the covered process and any future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n\r\nWCF primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA report is forwarded to the MPL Ohio Valley Region Manager to review. A schedule is developed to address the PHA team's recommendations (Action Items) in a timely and prioritized manner. The final resolution and completion of each Action Item is documented and retained at the WCF by designated Operations personnel.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, WCF periodically updates and revalidates the Woodhaven Cavern Facility PHA. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. Th"

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWCF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed by a designated group of operations personnel and annually certified by the Woodhaven Operations Specialist as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the WCF operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to the on-duty WCF Operator and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operation, WCF has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the Woodhaven Cavern Facility. New employees receive orientation training, which includes, but is not limited to, the following topics: Process Overview, Employee Involvement, General Safety Rules, Safe Work Permit, Lockout/Tagout, Blinding and Line Breaking, and the Safe Handling of LPG.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nWCF uses contractors at the WCF to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, WCF has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform WCF personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nWCF has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.
