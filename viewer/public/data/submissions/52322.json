      "SummaryText": "CLAXTON COLD STORAGE RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nClaxton Cold Storage Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policy is intended to fully comply with OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP) Regulation, (40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Claxton Cold Storage facility operates a cold storage facility that provide cooling and freezing capabilities for the storage of a variety of frozen food products.\n\nThe only RMP regulated chemical handled by Claxton Cold Storage is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for cooling and freezing products.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers and evaporators used throughout the refrigeration system.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact, and anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the refrigeration system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program at Claxton Cold Storage consists of OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM program contains the following elements equivalent to the requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program:\n\nEmployee Participation       \t\tProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis    \t\tOperating Procedures\nTraining"

Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1) the Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios were calculated according to EPA criteria and the results are on file at the Claxton Cold Storage facility. \n\nE. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents involving anhydrous ammonia at the Claxton Cold Storage facility over the past five years.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan at Claxton Cold Storage states that the facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release. The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the 24-Hour Warning LEPC: GEMA; 404-635-7200.  The local Claxton Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discussed emergency response coordination.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to the ammonia refrigeration process are planned at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements. Facility personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
