Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    We at Henkel US Operations Corporation (Henkel) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The most recent Offsite Consequences Analysis - Flammables, Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis - Flammables, Alternate Release Scenario Analysis - Flammables, Offsite Impacts (Population and Environmental), as well as the Five-Year Accident History were updated June 2021 with no major changes noted.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n    Our facility's primary activities encompass Henkel manufactures a variety of aerosol products.  Based on predictive filing, there could be as many as 14 substances and mixtures used in the aerosol process. These substances include Butane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isopentane, Dimethylether, Propane,and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl]. Butane is used for aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for aerosol propellant. Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for aerosol propellant. Isopentane is used for aerosol propellant. Propane is used for aerosol propellant. Dimethylether is used for aerosol propellant.  \n\n    \n\n    3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n    Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 2004 Edition. The "

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP and What if/Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA was finalized on 1/18/2020, with review meetings 11/26/2019, 12/9/2019, and 1/6/2020.\n\n    \n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n    For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Henkel maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n    \n\n    Training\n\n    Henkel has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n    \n\n    Mechanical Integrity\n\n    Henkel carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, co"

Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n    \n\n    Management of Change\n\n    Written procedures are in place at Henkel to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed in February 2021.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n    \n\n    Pre-startup Reviews\n\n    Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Henkel. The most recent review was performed on 10/29/2021 after the 10 year propellant tank inspection PM. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n    \n\n    Compliance Audits\n\n    Henkel conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was finalized on 1/18/2020, with review meetings on 11/26/2019, 12/9/2019, and 1/6/2020. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n    \n\n    Incident Investigation\n\n    Henkel promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are ret"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n    \n\n    Contractors\n\n    On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is conducted. Henkel has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    4.    Five-year Accident History\n\n    Henkel has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n    \n\n    5.    Emergency Response Plan\n\n    Henkel carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n    \n\n    To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n    \n\n    Ontario County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and veri"
