      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan covers the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's Nacogdoches, Texas Complex.  The complex consists of both a Poultry Processing facility and a Prepared Foods facility.  Both facilities refrigeration systems are of a standard two-stage refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in each system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia on site has increased since the last RMP plan was submitted, thus prompting this update to the RMP.  Because anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for this site, including consideration of two ammonia release scenarios identified as worst case release and alternate release scenario.  The worst case scenario, as defined by the EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the \u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel \u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Pilgrim's Pride Nacogdoches complex involves a failure of the High Pressure Receiver under maximum storage conditions.  The computer program, RMP*Comp, was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would re"

This scenario was performed using pre-defined conditions by the EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  The EPA-mandated meteorological conditions used for this scenario were Atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest daily maximum temperature (77\u00b0 F), and average humidity (50%).  \n\nThe EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n1.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia this vessel could hold would seldom if ever be reached.  The majority of the time the liquid level is approximately 50% or less. \n\n2.  Assumption is that ammonia liquefied under pressure is released at its boiling point.  At true atmospheric conditions only a fraction (about 20% of the total) of the liquid ammonia will release to the atmosphere flashing as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid will stay in the vessel or pool on the ground.\n\n3.  Requirement to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.\n\n4.  Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6% of the area of the full circle.\n\n5.  Assumption of a ground level release when the vessel is actually on the roof.\n\n6.  Worst case weather conditions are extremely uncommon.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of ammonia due to a transfer hose failure.  The scenario, by definition, is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and must reach an endpoint off site using the typical meteorological conditions of Atmospheric Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0"

In addition, the facility has procedures in place for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards pertaining to the system, as required under the RMP regulations.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and respirators for the refrigeration partners' use, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia.
