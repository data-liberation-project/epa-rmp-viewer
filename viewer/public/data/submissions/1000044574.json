Ottawa, Illinois facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.\n\nTyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nTyson operates a cold storage warehouse and distribution center at this location.  Support operations include receiving, shipping and administrative offices.  The facility was constructed in 2000.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting ("

The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B A?68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\n\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Ottawa, Illinois facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\n\nThe Ottawa, Illinois facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\n\nThe key concepts in Tyson's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  Tyson has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia systems.  Tyson employees a"

      "SummaryText": "re also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nTyson policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Tyson maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\n\nTyson is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, Tyson conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nTyson has not had a release of ammonia from the Ottawa, Illinois facility that has affected the public or the environment.  The facility was constructed in 2000.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTyson has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 10 hours per day, five days per week.  These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.  If a release occurs off-hours, both on-site and off-duty personnel will respond.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTyson completes a thorough review of the ammonia systems each time a design change is implemented.  Tyson is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
