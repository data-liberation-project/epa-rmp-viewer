Box 8, Miller, NE 68858\n                          Mailing Address\n\nRisk Management Plan  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Policy:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of\nhazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In\nthe event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to\nwork with our Local Fire Company(s),  Emergency Response\nPersonnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable\ndepending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release\nand to minimize the impact of the release to people and the\nenvironment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422910, Farm\nSupplies Wholesalers, however we are also engaged  in providing\nagricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and\nreloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our\narea.   Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject\nto the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted\nthat we also handle crop protectants  and these are included in\nour planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only\nthe Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct\napplication to farm fields during the early spring and fall\nmonths.  During the balance of the year little if any product\ntransfer occurs .   The maximum quantity stored in pressurized\npermanent storage vessels at the location described is 255,999\nLbs. The maximum on site vessel size is 18,000  gallons, storing\n76,500 Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would\nbe the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000\nto 42,000 lbs.  There may be at any given time throughout the year 30 \nnurse trailers (implements of animal"

These\nare individual units and are not plumbed together and are situated at least\n5 feet from one another in the nurse trailer parking area.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff\npresent only during the receiving and reloading of product for\ndelivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the\n2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a full time employee on\nsite, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero however, we have\npersonnel trained in the proper handling of anhydrous ammonia\nwithin 200 feet of our facility throughout the year.  Our\nfacilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various\ntimes of day and night throughout the year.   Time expended for\nthese inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is considered to be the release\nof the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The\nmaximum quantity released would be 76,500 Lbs. based on 85 % tank\ncapacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is based on EPA's RMP -\nComp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public and environmental\nreceptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC\n(Local Emergency Planning Committee) for their consideration and\nplanning.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during\nthe last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release\nwould be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses\nare protected by manual and self closing excess flow valves so our \nalternative release scenario is based on the\nloss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading\ntransportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point\nof dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06  miles (317 feet)\nrounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance."

      "SummaryText": "Item number 3.5 addressing quantity released shows a total\nquantity released of 79 pounds however due to the pressure in the\nline, the release rate is 200 pounds per minute which, given the\nrelease duration of 10 minutes would indicate a release of 2000\npounds.  When the pressure of anhydrous ammonia is reduced\nquickly, the material rapidly self-refrigerates to -28\u00c2\u00a7F.  Once\nthe liquid reaches this temperature the vaporization is quite\nslow, from where we estimate a 10 minute release duration.\nAdditionally, the excess flow valve which will stop the flow from\nthe tank when flow rates exceed the rating, has an orifice which\nwill allow 0.05 pounds per minute of ammonia to escape at 100\npsi.\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on\nguidelines found in the American National Standards Institute,\nInc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage\nand Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.
