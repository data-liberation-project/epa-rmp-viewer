Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nSummit County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are currently no planned activities at this time."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Goodyear Plant 5 Pilot Plant are strongly committed to associate, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and associate training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Akron Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are Research and Development where small quantities of rubber are produced.  The regulated substances at our facility are 1,3-Butadiene and Isoprene which are used as a raw material for the preparation of these rubbers.  Waste solvent is stored on site.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive stud"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Plant 5 Pilot Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that associates that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New associates receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years, whenever there is a change in the process, or as required.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Plant 5 Pilot Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process technicians, maintenance personnel or any other associate whose job tasks are affected by a"

      "SummaryText": "modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Plant 5 Pilot Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPlant 5 Pilot conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nAssociate Participation\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company associates are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our associates have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOur facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur."
