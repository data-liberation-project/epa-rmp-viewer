      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Conway Underground East (CUE) storage facility (Plant) has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream?s System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.  \n\nThe Plant?s Emergency Response Plan is site-specific.  It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies.  All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nNatural Gas Liquids (NGLs) (i.e., varying mixtures of demethanized NGLs, ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, natural gasoline, and Naptha) are stored in caverns at CUE for subsequent delivery by pipeline to other facilities.  The total volume of the available cavern storage is fixed.  However, each individual cavern may be used for more than one NGL, depending on marketplace requirements. Therefore, this RMP filing will be predictive. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe CUE Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The plant has also implanted all the elements of Williams Midstream?s System Integrity Plan (SIP), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards. Key element of these programs include:\n\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A systematic examination of the plant to identify possible hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOperating Procedures: The Plant maintains"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.  \n\nMechanical Integrity: The Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  \n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures: Examples of safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material, and confined space entry permits and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry is allowed into a permit required confined space.  \n\nTraining: The plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  The program includes Classroom, OJT, and compute"

Employees are tested to demonstrate competency.\n\nManagement of Change: Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts concerning an incident or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the facility is in compliance with applicable RMP / PSM / SIP procedures and regulations. \n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nNo reportable release of a regulated substance has occurred in the last 5 years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.  Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with The McPherson County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the LEPC. The Plant conducts perio"
