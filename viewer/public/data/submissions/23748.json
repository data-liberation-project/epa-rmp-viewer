      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Boise Cascade are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event of such a release, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Koochiching County Sheriff's Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nBoise Cascade owns and operates an integrated pulp and paper mill at this location.  Prior to January 2001, there were two regulated substances at the mill; chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  In January of 2001, chlorine was eliminated from the mill.  This changed the offsite consequence analysis.  Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 68.190 (b) (6), the mill reviewed and updated its original RMP.  This is the updated RMP for the mill, which reflects the elimination of chlorine.  The remaining regulated substance, chlorine dioxide, is used for pulp bleaching and biocide treatment of water in the paper machine and filter plant areas.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine Dioxide at our facility is 29,550 lbs.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite C"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Dioxide Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 17,100 lb. of Chlorine Dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 12 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for Chlorine Dioxide.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine Dioxide involves a release in the Chlorine Dioxide piping system.  The scenario involves the release of 72 lb. of Chlorine Dioxide. Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released indoors to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown procedures and pressure drop sensors.  Under average weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L is 1760 yards.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBoise Cascade maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the Chlorine Dioxide process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our Chlorine Di"

The study is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Boise Cascade maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.  These procedures are certified annually.\n\nTraining\nBoise Cascade has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating the Chlorine Dioxide process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBoise Cascade carries out highly documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures a"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes for Chlorine Dioxide are conducted as a regular practice at Boise Cascade.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBoise Cascade conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The previous two audits are kept on file.\n\nIncident Investigation\nBoise Cascade promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Chlorine Dioxide.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nBoise Cascade truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of Chlorine Dioxide occur.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\nBoise Cascade has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, over the past five years there have been no accidental releases with offsite consequences and no onsite injuries, deaths or property damage. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\nBoise Cascade has a written emergency response plan, which includes dealing with the accidental releases ofChlorine Dioxide.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program."
