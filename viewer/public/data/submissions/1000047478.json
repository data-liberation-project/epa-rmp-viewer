The following elements are addressed in the programs:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies [40 CFR 155(a)&(e)]\r\n\r\nPreventing the release of flammable chemicals is of paramount importance at the Corn Plant due to the serious acute health or catastrophic effects that may result from exposure to an explosion.  Management has made it clear that all leaks are to be taken seriously and that operation of the systems is expected to be performed in a careful and professional manner.  Emergency response policy is predicated on the serious nature of any flammable chemical leak, and stresses the importance of calling in properly trained and equipped professionals when a leak is beyond the capabilities on on-site employees.  The plant maintains an emergency response plan\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances  [40 CFR 155(b)]\r\n\r\nThe Corn Plant is owned by Archer Daniels Midland Company and is located at 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois, 62526.  The facility utilizes the wet corn milling process to produce two primary products:  high fructose corn syrup and fuel-grade ethanol. Biological fermentation and thermal distillation are utilized to produce ethyl alcohol from a corn starch slurry.  The 200 proof ethyl alcohol is made non-potable by the addition of 2.5% natural gasoline. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.\tWorst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios [40 CFR 155(c)]\r\n\r\nEPA has requested that Offsite Consequence Analysis information not be provided in the executive summary due to security concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps  [40 CFR 155(c)]"

A new safety professional has been added to staff to further develop the plant's emergency responses capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe plant has also implemented Environmental Management Systems to identify and mitigate release risks.  \r\n\r\nThe plant has also instituted a Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure issues affecting RMP are reviewed and addressed."
