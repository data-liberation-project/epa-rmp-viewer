Our prevention program includes the use of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training for all employees that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the Marshall Fire Dept. and the Clark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These steps have been taken to assure a quick response to any release and to minimize the impact of the release in our community and environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity released would be 186,000 pounds, in the facility's two tanks totaling 42,000gal.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is the release of the entire contents of the storage tanks as a gas in 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 186,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company policies.  The distance  to the endpoint of dispersion is 8.0 miles.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a two-inch transfer hose, with 1000 pounds released in a 5-minute period.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.30 miles.\n\nEffingham Equity complies with all rules and regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1  and OSHA 29 CFR- 1910.111 regarding proper storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe following is a list of all accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nOn Sunday August 9, 1998 our facility had a release of approximately 1560 pounds of anhydrous"

No off-site or on-site injuries occurred, but some nearby residences experienced vegitation damage.\n\nEffingham Equity has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR- 1910.38.  Our action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the LEPC for coordination of community response planning.\n\nImproving safety at Effingham Equity is an on-going process.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
