This RMP/CalARP, submitted by E.F. Oxnard LLC (EFO LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal.\n\nAs background for this facility, EFO LLC is the current owner. E.F. Oxnard, Inc. (EFO) was owner/operator of the facility that prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to U.S. EPA and the City of Oxnard Fire Department under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP); EFO\u00bfs RMP/CalARP document was submitted June 21, 1999. \n\nAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA under the filename \u00bfEFO_EXEC\u00bf as a text document.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of EFO LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located in the City of Oxnard and County of Ventura, California. \n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policy\n\nIt is the policy of EFO LLC to protect the health and safety of its employees, officers, and the general public.  It is the firm policy of EFO LLC to fully and faithfully comply with all requirements, both substantive and reporting, of all environmental, health, and safety statues, regulations, ordinances, and permits affecting the operations and maintenance of our plants.  EFO LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\n\nTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, EFO LLC has developed the following: maintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is"

The first system is a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit that uses ammonia to control oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from the exhaust of a natural gas-fired cogeneration gas turbine. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon tank and gravity fed to a vaporizer where it is conveyed to the SCR unit. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that has historically been handled in this system is 10,500 gallons; however, current facility policy implements administrative controls to further reduce contents to 60%, or no more than 7,200 gallons. \n\nThe second system is the Aqua Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Plant (AAARP). The AAARP system contains approximately 2,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia at various concentrations. Steam from the turbine is used to power a refrigeration cycle.  The ammonia process piping of the AAARP is connected to the Boskovich Farms, Inc. (Boskovich) refrigeration system and runs independently from the SCR system.  Although the refrigeration system is physically located to the south of the plant on the neighboring Boskovich property, it is included in this RMP because EFO LLC owns/operates the AAARP and leases from Boskovich the land on which the system is located. The AAARP system also serves a chiller system located at the EFO LLC facility.\n\n1.3\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administra"

The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.  \n\nProcess safety equipment means that the facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.  EFO LLC\u00bfs process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distributed Control System (DCS).\n\nThe ammonia handling processes include relief, excess flow, and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released. Furthermore, ammonia sensors are located at various locations throughout the facility, and there are automatic system shutdowns.\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the EFO LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; regularly scheduled shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking daily repair work orders and scheduled maintenance operations. \n\nAn operator training program encompassing operating procedures"

This RMP/CalARP, submitted by E.F. Oxnard LLC (EFO LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal.\r\rAs background for this facility, EFO LLC is the current owner. E.F. Oxnard, Inc. (EFO) was owner/operator of the facility that prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to U.S. EPA and the City of Oxnard Fire Department under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP); EFO's RMP/CalARP document was submitted June 21, 1999. \r\rAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA under the filename EFO_EXEC as a text document.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of EFO LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located in the City of Oxnard and County of Ventura, California. \r\r1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policy\r\rIt is the policy of EFO LLC to protect the health and safety of its employees, officers, and the general public.  It is the firm policy of EFO LLC to fully and faithfully comply with all requirements, both substantive and reporting, of all"

      "SummaryText": "environmental, health, and safety statues, regulations, ordinances, and permits affecting the operations and maintenance of our plants.  EFO LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\r\rTo prevent the accidental release of ammonia, EFO LLC has developed the following: maintenance procedures to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and functioning properly; operating procedures to ensure that equipment is operated in a manner that minimizes the possibility of an ammonia release; employee training to ensure that operators know how to properly use the equipment and non-operators are aware of the dangers of ammonia and the necessary steps to take in the event of an ammonia release; and fencing around the site to minimize the possibility of a third party damaging  equipment or releasing ammonia.\r\r1.2 Description of Regulated Process\r\rThis RMP covers two anhydrous ammonia systems. The first system is a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit that uses ammonia to control oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from the exhaust of a natural gas-fired cogeneration gas turbine. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon tank and gravity fed to a vaporizer where it is conveyed to the SCR unit. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that has historically been handled in this system is 10,500 gallons; however, current facility policy implements administrative controls to further reduce contents to 60%, or no more than 7,200 gallons. \r\rThe second system is the Aqua Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Plant (AAARP). The AAARP system contains approximately 2,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia at various concentrations. Steam from the turbine is used to power a refrigeration cycle.  The ammonia process piping of the AAARP is connected to the Boskovich Farms, Inc. (Boskovich) refrigeration system and runs independently from the SCR system.  Although the refrigeration system is physically located"

      "SummaryText": "to the south of the plant on the neighboring Boskovich property, it is included in this RMP because EFO LLC owns/operates the AAARP and leases from Boskovich the land on which the system is located. The AAARP system also serves a chiller system located at the EFO LLC facility.\r\r1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\rThe facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), its Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which provides for the identification, prevention and minimization of chemical releases that could result from failures in processes, procedures and equipment.  The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.  \r\rProcess safety equipment means that the facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.  EFO LLC's process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distributed Control System (DCS).\r\rThe ammonia handling processes include relief, excess flow, and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released. Furthermore, ammonia sensors are located at various locations throughout the facility, and there are automatic system shutdowns.\r\rA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the EFO LLC facility.  These include written s"
