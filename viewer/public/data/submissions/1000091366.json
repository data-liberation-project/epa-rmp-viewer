      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\nHempel (USA), Inc. operates a paint manufacturing facility located at 2728 Empire Central, Dallas, Texas.  The facility's primary function is the manufacture of paints, resins and emulsions.  The facility is described by Standard Industrial Classification Codes 2821 and 2851 (NAICS 325510).  The plant employs 102 people.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \r\nIt is the policy of Hempel to meet all applicable health, safety and environmental (HSE) obligations by integrating HSE compliance into its business processes.  The company seeks opportunities to integrate environmentally sustainable technologies and safer materials  when developing new products and empowers employees to stop work and report any unsafe or potential unsafe conditions or behaviors.  Employees are encouraged to bring forth suggestions to improve safety or reduce the environmental impact of the company's' operations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe facility handles and stores Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) unspecified isomer, CAS # 26471-62-5 which is used in the resin manufacturing process.  TDI is stored in liquid form in a dedicated storage tank situated in Tank Farm #2. The volume of TDI in the tank is administratively controlled to be less than 10,000 gallons. TDI is transported to the resin manufacturing area by dedicated piping and pumps. The facility is subject to Program Level 1 requirements for Risk Management Planning. The facility has performed a worst case analysis and determined that the planning toxic endpoint for TDI is 50 yards.  There are no public receptors within the 50 yard planning distance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nTo prevent accidental releases of TDI the facility utilizes a system of employee training, engineering controls and routine maintenance to reduce the risk of accidental release. Employees that handle TDI hav"

Employees undergo annual refresher training to ensure their understanding and awareness of the hazards of TDI. Engineering controls have been put in place to reduce the potential for a release of TDI. TDI is stored in an aboveground tank which is compatible with the material that is stored and the operating temperature and pressure of the material. All TDI piping is situated aboveground where it is monitored for corrosion, abrasion or leakage.  Piping is protected from traffic by being suspended in overhead racks.  The TDI tank is situated in a concrete secondary containment structure with no breaks or valves.  The containment is capable of containing the entire contents of the TDI tank.. Finally the facility performs routine maintenance of all tanks and piping.  Visual inspections of tanks, pumps and piping are conducted monthly to check for corrosion and leaks. Weekly safety walks are conducted to identify potential safety risks within the facility.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThe facility has had no release of TDI in the previous five years, 2015-2020. There have been no injuries, deaths, property damage, evacuations, shelter in place or environmental damage due to the storage and use of TDI at the facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nHempel (USA), Inc. Dallas has developed a written Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) that details the specific steps that will be taken in response to an accidental release of a regulated substance. Response actions that will be taken are determined by whether the amount spilled is considered a minor spill or a major spill.  Major spills include large volume spills, spills that have impacted surface water or are likely to migrate offsite. Specific steps to be taken in response to a release of Toluene diisocyanate are included in the ICP. The ICP lists emergency response equipment and perso"

The ICP includes procedures for internal and external notification to responding agencies as well as procedures for how notification will be made to the public.  The location of nearby hospitals and urgent care clinics are noted in the ICP. The ICP is reviewed annually. \r\n\r\nEmergency response training compliant with 29 CFR 1910.120 is provided annually to employees. Information on emergency response training provided to employees is described in Section 2.22, Annex 5 and 6 of the ICP. Employee training records are maintained electronically and updated as employees complete required training courses.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nHempel is committed to continuous improvement is all aspects of health, safety and environmental performance. As part of ongoing efforts towards that goal, capital projects are in process to modernize the resin manufacturing plant. All new employees or contractors will receive appropriate training before beginning their job functions & Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)."
