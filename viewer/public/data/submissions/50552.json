      "SummaryText": "Process Description:\nThe 30,000 gallon Liquid Natural Gasoline tank is located on an abandoned surface mining operation near Holden, Logan County, West Virginia. The product in the tank is a mixture of hydrocarbons that are equivalent in physical and flammable properties to iso pentane (Butane,2methyl). The tank is isolated within a security fence and located aproximately 2000 feet from the Grant Compressor station. The tank is fed by gravity from the chiller system at the compressor station through a 2 inch underground line. The tank operates at ambient temperature and is designed with relief devices for 250 psig.\nThere is a liquid pumping station that is used to load trucks that haul the isopentane to a third party facility for further processing.\n\nEMERGENCY PLAN:\n\nThe Logan County Local Emergency Planning Committee is aware of this installation along with Cora Volunteer fire department. The Cora Fire Department is the first responder for this facility.\nEquitable Resources Inc. will review and update their emergency response coordination with Logan LEPC and Cora Fire Department by June 2008"
