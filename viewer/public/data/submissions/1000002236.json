ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nWaterbury Companies recognizes that chemical accident prevention and emergency response are two most important aspects of a safety program. It is our company policy to comply with all applicable environmental health and safety codes and regulations. Through written programs, policies for accident prevention and emergency reponse have been established and our employees trained in both general and specific rights and responsibilities to assure minimal risk in our handling and storage of chemicals as well as the production and storage of our finished products. All process equipment and safety devices are maintained in proper working order and are inspected regularly to reduce the risk of a chemical incident. \n\nIn 2001, a new warehouse was completed that fully meets NFPA 30-B requirements for aerosol products storage. It is our mission to continue to be an integral part of the local community and an environmentally responsible neighbor.\n\n2. THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nWaterbury Companies, Inc. operates a small industrial facility in Independence, LA where fragrance and pesticide products are packaged typically in aerosol cans for commercial users. There are two RMP-covered processes using liquefied petroleum gasses (LPG) at the Independence facility, namely aerosol production and aerosol storgae. The LPGs are use to pressurize cans of liquid concentrate to provide the delivery system common to aerosol products. The regulated substances are stored in 5 bulk pressure vessels of various volumes. The regulated substances are difluroethane (a flammable gas) and four flammable gas mixtures, mostly LPGs. All of the tanks are located in one area, the \"tank farm\", and are protected by a deluge system and a combustible gas detection sensor. The \"gas house\" is located immediately adjacent to the \"tank farm\". This houses the equipment for delivery of the gas int"

All production areas are sprinklered and the aerosol mixing and filling line atmospheres are monitored by combustible gas detectors that impose controls over the processes if necessary.\n\nAfter the filling process is completed (cans filled, labeled, boxed, etc.) the aerosol products are stored in a separate warehouse. The warehouse meets NFPA 30-B standards for aerosol storage and is completely sprinklered, has fire walls, includes thermo-linked fire doors, and is regularly inspected for safety compliance. The stored products vary in size (2 oz. to 30 oz.) and in formualtion. The flammability depends on the formulation and many of the products are classified as Level 3 aerosols according to NFPA standards.\n\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with all federal, state, and local regulations and meets or exceeds industry standards for chemical accident prevention. These include OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's Chemical Accident Prevention Program. These two laws require hazard analyses as well as maintenance and operating procedures aimed at prevention of chemical accidents. Waterbury has also designed and operated this facility based on National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards for fire prevention and safety. These standards include: NFPA 30 \"Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code\"; NFPA 58 \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gasses\"; and NFPA 30-B Standard for the Production and Storage of Aerosol Products\".\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWaterbury's Emergency Response Program was written based on the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) Guidance. This plan incorporates emergency response guidelines from the United States Environ"

By combining the requirements of each regulation, the ICP provides a more efficient \"one plan\" that meet requirements of all and provides both efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThe Integrated Contingency Plan includes assessments of hazardous material incidents, response procedures, and communication guidelines for within the plant and for public and regulatory agency contact. Employees are trained in emergency response procedures and participate in periodic evacuation drills that are evaluated for timeliness and effectiveness. In addition, this plan has ben discussed with the Independence Fire Department, the first responders to any incident at the facility.\n\n6. CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENT:\n\nThe current aerosol warehouse was completed in 2001 to meet NFPA 30-B standards. Additionally, In-rack sprinklers were installed to continue to allow different storage configurations while providing proper storage of aerosol products. An onsite diesel generator was installed shortly after hurricane Katrina. "
