The company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\nDutch Farms has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such accidental releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.  The City of Chicago\u00bfs Fire Department will provide emergency response in addition to the company\u00bfs own Emergency Response Team.\n\nFacility Description and the Regulated Substances\n\nThe Chicago, IL facility of Dutch Farms is a warehouse and distribution center for refrigerated food products.  Ammonia refrigeration is used to cool or freeze food products.  Ammonia refrigeration is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Liquid ammonia is changed to a gas and then condensed for reuse.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nDutch Farms has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and materials to minimize the possibility of releases.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous mate"
