Crete facility, which was constructed in 1974, is a slaughterhouse that processes approximately 10,000 hogs daily into fresh and processed pork products. The plant employs roughly 2,000 individuals with an annual payroll of @ $50 million. Hogs are transported to the facility from area farms throughout the day and temporarily housed in pens for slaughtering.  Facility processes consist of slaughtering, cutting of carcasses into fresh / frozen products, grinding, smokehouse utilization for ham, sausage and bacon production and the rendering of by-products. Additional peripheral activities include but are not limited to water/wastewater treatment, maintenance, sanitation, packaging, quality assurance, etc. \n                                                             \nAmmonia (anhydrous) (CAS #7664-41-7) is used as the primary refrigerant in the refrigeration system.  To minimize the risk of bacterial contamination, many of the processing areas are maintained at low temperatures which is provided by the refrigeration system. The large quantity of meat products that are processed and stored on site prior to shipment require an expansive refrigeration system to maintain product integrity. \n\nApproximately 150,000 lbs are ubiquitously located throughout the facility in the system tanks and piping. This quantity is in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold quantity specified by 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112 (c)(7), subpart (G), Risk Mangement Plan for certain chemicals that would require a Risk Management Program (RMP).

The overall approach to the proper storage and handling of these materials is one of training and prevention. Every individual that is employed at the plant undergoes chemical hazard training as a condition of employment. This knowledge is reinforced with refresher classes on an annual basis. The company policy toward accidental release prevention is maintaining a knowledable and highly trained workforce. Along with the training, the company provides its workforce with the equipment and information it needs to protect itself from chemical hazards and it diligent in its efforts to ensure employee safety. Failure to adhere to the established safety regulations can result in suspension and/or termination of employment.\n\nAnother integral part in minimizing accidental chemical releases is an ongoing equipment preventative maintenance (PM) program. Properly maintained equipment can prevent releases from occuring. The PM program on the equipment involved in the refrigeration as well as all plant equipment is based on computerized program that tracks & maintains scheduled maintenance requirements.  For the refrigeration system, there is an entire department (Motive Power) dedicated to the safe operation and preventive maintenance on the system on three daily shifts.. The RMP and PSM programs require extensive refrigeration operator training and periodic equipment reviews & documentation to ensure that the system is maintained in proper working order. The initial and subsequent refresher traing is conducted by a contracted refrigeration company. \n\nSenior management commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures are the driving forces behind the low accident rates experienced at the facility.

At the Corporate level, independent safety audits are scheduled & performed by a contracted third party auditor on OSHA required programs. These audits are used to identify program shortfalls and to ensure all regulations are strictly adhered to.\n\nFinally, Farmland Foods, Inc., has committed substantial time and resourses to the implementation and certification of its facilities to the ISO 14001 international environmental standard. The Crete facility is one of the few slaughterhouses in the United States to meet the requirements of the standard which establishes the requirements of an effective Environmental Management System (EMS). This program advocates three environmental idioms - continually improving, following regulations and preventing pollution. The system is audited both by an internal team and externally by a third party on a periodic basis. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has been identified by the EMS Team as a significant aspect in the EMS Program. This designation indicates that the system has the potential for causing a significant impact on the employees and/or the environment. Because of this designation, the special attention is given to the performance of operating procedures and preventative maintenance performance.

The EPA has stated that that they expect facilities that are covered by both PSM and RMP to have one accident prevention program. The PSM program has written and documented procedures that address all aspects of the following elements:\n1) Process Safety Information\n2) Process Hazard Analysis\n3) Standard Operating Procedures\n4) Training\n5) Mechanical Integrity Program\n6) Management of Change\n7) Pre-Startup Safety Review\n8) Compliance Audits\n9) Incident Investigations\n10) Employee Participation\n11) Hot Work Permit\n12) Contractor Qualitfication\n\nThe Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there has not been a reportable release of ammonia at the Farmland Foods, Inc.

Refresher classes for the Team are provided on an annual basis by an outside contractor.\n\nWritten Emergency Response Plans (ERPs) have been prepared and are controlled documents within the EMS Program.

Emergency planning and Community-Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title III is provided to the SERC, LEPC and other appropriate agencies (ie Crete Fire Department).\n\nAs part of the facility emergency response plan, pre-planning activities are conducted with employees:\n1) Evacuation routes and relocation drills are conducted annually.\n2) The alarm system used to alert employees in the event of an emergency is explained and tested.

This review, or Job Hazard Analysis (JHA), will involve the observation of each job currently being performed at the facility and evaluating its associated real and potential safety hazards. The hazards will be determined not only by the job, the equipment and the envornment, but will include ergonomic ramifications from long term performance. Personal protective equipment requirements will be determined based on the review.\n\nEnvironmental exposure to chemical releases has been significantly reduced at the Crete facility since the initial submission of its Risk Management Plan. The previous submission contained an additional chemical (chlorine) that exceeded the threshold quantity trigger for having both a PSM and RMP program. With a successful inventory reduction plan, quantities are now below the 1500 lb. and 2500 lb. thresholds. Additional reductions of on-site chemical hazards are being reviewed (ie. Converting the wastewater disinfection system from chlorine gas to ultraviolet light. This change will reduce both the quantity of chlorine gas on site, as well as the sodium bisulfite used for de-chlorination).\n\nTo further promote safety at the Crete facility, the management team has elected to participate in the Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) offered by OSHA. The goal of the program is to recognize companies that voluntarily implement comprehensive safety and health programs that exceed basic compliance with OSHA standards. The requirements to qualify for the VPP Programs are currently under review."
