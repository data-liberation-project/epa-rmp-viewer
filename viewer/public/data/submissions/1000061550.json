Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSINOMAX is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  An appropriate response to releases of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is in the written Risk Management Program.  Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nThe SINOMAX facility produces urethane foam for mattresses located in La Vergne, Tennessee. \n\nUrethane foam is a product made of combining chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction as they are injected into a mold cavity. One of the chemical mixtures contains 80% Toluene 2, 4-Diisocyanate (TDI) and approximately 25% Toluene 2, 6-Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in three (3) 20,000-gallon TDI Bulk Storage Tanks. The facility will also have on site up to four (4) rail cars with capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons each.  \n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process. The facility will reach or exceed the threshold quantity operations in December 2016.\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 2 of the RMP regulations.\n\nB.

Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. SINOMAX's specific prevention steps include:\n\n1. Hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control potential TDI process hazards,\n\n2. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process,\n\n3. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and   \n\n   emergency response personnel.\n\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\n    \n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\n\nThe RMP requires SINOMAX to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\n\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions.\n\nA release from one (1) of the 20,000-gallon storage tanks has been identified as the worst-case release and was considered in the hazard assessment.

      "SummaryText": "The TDI component of the chemical mixture in the 20,000-gallon storage tank equates to approximately 204,000 lbs. of TDI. The tank is located within the manufacturing building and is surrounded by secondary containment which would contain a spill from the tank, thereby reducing the evaporation rate of the spill.\n\nThe impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's RMPcomp Model. The impact distance from the RMPcomp Model results in an impact distance of 0.4 miles. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property. There are no people living within the potentially affected area.\n\nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  SINOMAX has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is a process piping release from a process line carrying TDI from the storage tank to the pouring head. The leak would release approximately 540 lbs. of TDI. The RMPcomp Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the alternative release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are no people living within the potentially affected area.\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information: SINOMAX will complete a compilation of written safety information to be used in conducting the Hazard Review. The Hazard Review will be conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the TDI System. \n\nHazard Review: SINOMAX will update and revalidate the Hazard Review as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The Hazard Review was conducted using  the \"What IF\" methodology, which is one of the methodologies specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including one member who has expertise in the TDI System and a m"

These written operating procedures will be consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures will be readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice.

This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.67.  Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary. SINOMAX documents and maintains records of employee training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\nMechanical Integrity: SINOMAX will develop a written preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the TDI process (i.e., storage tanks, pumps, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed.\n\nEac"

The compliance audit will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the TDI system.  A report of the findings of the audit will be developed.
