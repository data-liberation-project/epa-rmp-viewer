Simplot Company, Don Plant, Don Siding, Idaho, is committed to being a responsible  community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and on oing. Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a ?significant accidental release? to the air from the plant. The Chubbuck Fire Department and local emergency agencies receive the annual Sara Title III reports on materials manufactured, stored, and handled at the Don Plant.  It is Simplot?s policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory agencies.\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances manufactured, processed, stored, or handled:\n   1) The J.R. Simplot Company, Don Plant facility manufactures fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and animal feed supplements. The Don Plant unloads, stores, and handles anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the threshold limits requiring a RMP.\nc) The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n   1)  Six dispersion models were done for the release of ammonia from the Simplot Don Plant. A worst-case scenario and five alternative release scenarios were modeled.\n   2) The worst-case scenario was the rupture of one high-pressure bullet and the release of the entire contents in 10 minutes. 79 tons of ammonia would be released. The model was run as a horizontal jet release of vapor ammonia and an expanding pool of liquid ammonia with it's own release rate. The release\nrate would be 119.7 kg/sec. Placing concrete barriers around bullets, thus preventing vehicular contact, has reduced"

      "SummaryText": " the potential for this scenario. Also replacing both old bullets with new bullets has reduced the potential for mechanical failure.\n   3) The first alternative release scenario assumed that a pressure relief valve opened at 250 psig and became stuck in the open position for 10 minutes. The pressure relief valves vent vertically directly above the tank. The model was run as a vertical release of vapor ammonia. The release rate would be 16.2 kg/sec. Implementing maintenance procedures that check pressure relief valves has reduced the potential for this scenario. Also the vent pipe is higher than modeled and would result in lower ground level concentrations. \n   4) The second alternative release scenario assumed that a standard loading hose from the high-pressure bullet tanks breaks at the loading dock during a transfer operation. The bullets were assumed to be at normal pressures of 110 psig. The model was run with a fraction of the ammonia immediately released as vapor and the remainder spilled onto the ground forming an expanding pool. The assumption was made that the release would continue for 10 minutes before flow could be shut off. The release rate would be 68 kg/sec. The potential for this release has been virtually eliminated by high-flow shut-off valves on each bullet.\n   5) The third alternative release scenario assumed that the entire 6500-ton capacity of the low-pressure storage vessel is released. Guidelines in 40 CFR 68 dictate that the release be modeled as an instantaneous 1cm deep pool. At this depth the pool would be 728,296 square meters when the secondary containment berm surrounding the vessel was considered. The secondary containment berm holds 48,000 cubic feet of liquid over a surface area of 12,230 feet. This release scenario would result in the entire volume of ammonia evaporating in 974 seconds at a rate of 6,070 kg/sec. This release scenario was modeled simply to comply with 40 CFR Part 68. It is unrealistic to assume that liquid ammonia\nc"

The secondary containment berm was constructed to mitigate release from the low-pressure storage vessel. Pressure relief valves assure the vessel will not overpressurize.\n   6) The fourth alternative release scenario also assumed that the entire 6500-ton capacity of the low-pressure storage vessel was released over 10 minutes. Again the secondary containment berm was considered. This scenario was modeled with the more realistic consideration of a continuous evaporation as the pool expanded. The calculated pool surface area and evaporation rate was averaged for the first hour of the release to be 123,028 square feet and 1,022 kg/sec.  Again the secondary containment berm was constructed to mitigate the affects of the release from the low-pressure storage vessel by keeping the ammonia in a liquid form. Pressure relief valves assure the vessel will not overpressurize.\n   7) The fifth alternative release scenario represented the most probable release from\nthe low-pressure storage tank. The scenario assumed a release from a leak below the liquid level filling the secondary containment berm only. The calculated release rate was 9.9 kg/sec. Like the previous two scenarios the secondary containment berm was constructed to mitigate release from the low-pressure storage vessel and pressure relief valves assure the vessel will not overpressurize. \n\nd)  The general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n   1) Employees are trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials in the Plant. Each employee receives initial training, and refresher training every three years, appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned. Anhydrous ammonia is used and stored in several locations in the plant and employees assigned to these areas are trained to understand the hazards involved and to handle them safely.\n   2) In addition to training, t"

The following elements of Process Safety Management decrease the likelihood of a release:\n   (1) Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\n   (2) Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be affected.\n   (3) Process Hazard Analyses are performed on all new processes and every five years on existing processes that contain ammonia.\n   (4) Management of Change reviews are performed to prevent failure due to improper engineering of modifications.\n   (5) Operating Procedures are in place and operators are trained on these procedures.\n   (6) Incident Investigations are done on any accident or near miss to find possible changes that can be made to prevent future incidents.\n   (7) Emergency Response and Planning helps to mitigate the results of releases.\n   (8) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are done on all new or modified processes to assure proper construction.\ne) The five-year accident history\n    1) The Don Plant has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia with offsite consequences within the last five years.\nf)   The emergency response program:\n    1) The Simplot Tactical Area Response Team (STAR Team) is a Simplot emergency response team comprised of trained employees. These employees are trained to respond to fires (in their incipient stages), chemical, medical and evacuation/rescue emergencies at the Don Plant. \n    2) In-plant emergency response is governed by the OSHA PSM: Emergency Response Plan.
