ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES \n\n\n\n Freezer Queen recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, \n\nproperty, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of \n\nammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all Freezer Queen \n\npersonnel who operate the Ammonia Refrigeration System. \n\n\n\n The Freezer Queen PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for \n\ndeveloping, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its Ammonia \n\nOperating and Management Systems. The Freezer Queen PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \n\n\"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we \n\nexpect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed. \n\n\n\n Freezer Queen believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program. \n\nOperating level employees, particularly the Engine Room Manager and the Principle Chief Refrigeration \n\nEngineer, have been deeply involved and they (along with the Refrigeration System Operators) assume the \n\nmajor responsibility for operating the Hazardous Material process safely. \n\n\n\n The Freezer Queen Emergency Action Plan has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of \n\nthe local Public Emergency Response Agency. All Freezer Queen employees have received documented \n\nemergency action plan training. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
