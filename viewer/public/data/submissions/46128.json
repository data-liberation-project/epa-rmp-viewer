      "SummaryText": "A 6000 gallon (25440 lbs @ 4.24 lbs/gal propane) above ground propane fuel tank is located on the east side of the property adjacent to a service road and parking lot.  The tank is accessable from each side.  The tank facility is enclosed by a chainlink fence.  There is no dike or blast wall around the tank.  The structure is accessible to authorized airport peronel and the propane supplier.\n\nThe facility is located aproximately 60 ft. from the classromm office building (94 OEA), approximately 150 ft. from the power plant building (90 APB), and 1000 ft. from the airframe building (89 AAB) that serves the Vincennes University teaching programs.  The above ground propane tank is approximately 320 ft. from the gasoline dispersal pumps and 320 ft. from the above ground Fire-Guard aviation and jet fuel storage.  These facilities are shielded from direct view of the propane tank by the classroom office building and the airframe building.  The propane tank is approximately 110 ft. from a business building and 225 ft. from an auto sales building, neither of which is owned by Vincennes University.\n\nAssessment of the potential hazards of the facility are:\n\n1. A leak developing in the building from LP gas supply lines.\n2. Damage to underground LP lines due to excavating or digging.\n3. Hose rupture during fuel transfer.\n4. The propane tank developing a leak, catching on fire or exploding.\n\nThe propane tank is set above ground on a base.  There is no dike or blast wall.\n\nMedical emergency will be handled by calling the Lawrence Allison Township Fire Department and Knox County 911(Indiana).  Because of the distance involved for the Lawrence Allison Unit, the Vincennes Ambulance services will probably respond faster and although they must cross the stateline will serve the O'Neal airport.\n\nAssessment of the potential hazards of the facility are:"
