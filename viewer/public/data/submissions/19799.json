This commitment is inherent to our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procdures, maintenance,and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of a regulated substance.  Unforseeably, if a releasr occur, we are cooridnated with the Scott County EMA which can provide highly trained emergency response personal to control and mitigate the effect of the release.\n\n2:  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBTANCE HANDLED\n     Our facilities main activity is the treatment of water.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is chlorine.  The chlorine is received in ton containers and used to disenfect the water. The maximum inventory of chlorine on hand is 4,000 pounds.\n\n3:  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n     To evaluate the worst case scenario and alternative release scenario we have used the look -up tables and equations provided by the EPAin the RMP Off Site Consequence Analysis Guidenace, as well as SAFER/TRACE. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenario.\n      The worst case scenario submitted for program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic   release from a   2,000 lb. chlorine  sontainer.  This scenario involves the release of 2,000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes with passive mitigation of the chlorine being stored in the chlorine room, under worst case weather conditions, namely class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 mph wind speed.  The maximum distance of 3.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/l.\n     The alternative release scenario fo"

This scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes with class D atmospheric stability and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  With chlorine detectors as active mitigation, and the chlorine being stored in the chlorine  room for passive mitigation.  The maximum distance of 2.70 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/l.\n\n   TRAINING\n     Huntsville Utility District has a training program in place to ensure its employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with these process.\n\n     MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n     Procedures are in place at Huntsville Utility District to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedure.  Operators, maintenance personal or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modifications.\n\n    PRE- START UP PREVIEW\n     Pre start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to established processes are a regular practice at Huntsville Utility District.  These reviews are conducted to confirm construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures  are suitable for safe start up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n    COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n     Huntsville Utility District has audits conducted by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Division of Water Supply every three years to ensure that we are in compliance with all state and federal regulations.\n\n    INCEDENT INVESTIGATION\n    Huntsville Utility District promptly investigates any incident that has, or could reasonably result in catastrophic releaseof a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identfy the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccuring.\n\n   EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION \n   Huntsville Utility District truly"

Employees are strongly encouraged to epress thier views concerning accident prevention issues and to recomend improvements.\n\n  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC STEPS\n\n    PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n  Our facility conducted a study to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled effectively.  The method used to carry out thid analysis is WHAT IF.  This study was undertaken by our waterplant personal and is to be reevauated at three year intervals.\n\n    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n    Huntsville Utilty District has had no accidental releases over the past five years.\n\n   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n    Huntsville Utility District has an emergency reponse plan  to deal with accidental releases of hazardeous chemicals.  Thia plan involves all aspects of emergency response including adequqte first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  To ensure proper function , our emergency response equipment is regularlyinspected and serviced.  Scott  County Emergency Management Assistance is the local emergency planning agency with which our emergency plan is coordinated."
