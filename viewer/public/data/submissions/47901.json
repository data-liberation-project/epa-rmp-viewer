      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of E Street Cold Logistics to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  E Street Cold Logistics implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe E Street Cold Logistics facility is located at 903 East `E' Street in Wilmington, California.  The facility is situated approximately 1.5 miles east of Highway 110 (I-5) and 1 mile south of Pacific Coast Highway.  The entire facility was constructed in 2002 with operations starting in late November of the same year.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is industrial.\n\nThe primary business of the E Street Cold Logistics is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the blast freezer, freezer and cooler storage room"

Typical operating conditions range from vacuum 1.6\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 166 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nA Hazard Assessment was conducted for the facility to determine the potential impacts to the surrounding community due to an accidental release of ammonia.  The Hazard Assessment modeled two scenarios:  a worst case and an alternate release scenario.  In order to determine the impacted population around the facility, the potential for exposure to concentrations exceeding the EPA Toxic Endpoint (EPA TE) value was investigated.  For ammonia, the EPA TE concentration for a one hour averaging time is 200 ppm.  The furthest EPA TE distance reached by an ammonia cloud from the facility is 1.5 miles in the worst case scenario where the entire contents of the High Pressure Receiver is released in 10 minutes.  The alternate release scenario is a small hole (0.25\") in a pipeline that reaches 0.1 miles from the facility. \n\nSince the initial study, there have been no significant changes to the ammonia refrigeration system.  As such, the release scenarios, with respect to the release distances within which adverse health effects can be observed and the types of release scenarios employed, have not changed and still represent a fulfillment of the Hazard Assessment requirements of the Risk Management Plan.\n\nWorst Case Release Summary\n\nThe worst case release scenario was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel. The largest vessel, the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receive, is located indoors and has a maximum capacity of 24,000 pounds of ammonia.  This quantity was modeled as being released in 10 minutes, in an urban setting, under pessimistic meteorological conditions (1.5 meter per second wind speed and F atmospheric stability class).  Based upon the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Exhibit 4-4 modeling method, the worst case scenario reache"

This quantity was modeled as being released in 60 minutes, in an urban setting, using a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and D atmospheric stability class.  Based upon the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Exhibit 4-5 modeling method, the alternative release scenario reaches off-site locations and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release scenario.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3) California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by E Street Cold Logistics to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place be"

The Hot Work Permit program ensures that E Street Cold Logistics' employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will:\n\n50 ppm:    audio and visual alarms will automatically be activated.\n\n150 ppm:  1) The King Solenoid Valve, and the solenoid valves on the main liquid lines out of the Engine Room will close; 2) The solenoid valves located on the evaporators in the area where the detection occurred will close; 3)  If the detection was in the Engine Room, the exhaust fan will automatically switch on.  \n\n900 ppm: 1)  If the leak is detected in the Engine Room, or a cold storage area, the detection system will automatically de-energize power to the engine room, or refrigerated area; 2) The Refrigeration Control Panel will automatically send a signal to the alarm monitoring company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the E Street Cold Logistics facility?s accident history during the Five-Year Revalidation, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years *.

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n? save lives;\n? minimize and avoid injuries;\n? protect the environment; and\n? minimize property damage.\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPrior to the system being filled with ammonia, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA of the refrigeration system consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? seismic assessment;\n? series of safety checklists; and\n? Facility Walkdown.\n\nA PHA Revalidation study was conducted in October 2006.  During the PHA Revalidation, Tracer ES&T led the team through several tasks as follows:\n\n- Review of the PHA Requirements / History (Overview / Training Session)\n- A detailed review of the recommended action items from the 2002 initial study.\n- Process Flow Diagram Review / Equipment List Review\n- A detailed review of any changes to the ammonia refrigeration system since the 2002 study (reviewed Management of Change Records).\n- A discussion of any releases of ammonia since the 2002 study.\n- Review 2002 Initial PHA HAZOP Log Tables.\n- Review of Emergency Response, EPA Alert, External Events and Human Factors checklists.\n\nThe results of the PHA Revalidation study include mitigation measures such as additional training, key maintenance-related tests/in"
