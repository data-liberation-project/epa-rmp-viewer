The treated NGLs are further processed to remove ethane and propane prior to being returned to the pipeline system.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n\n\nNo public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the Facility.  An adjacent EnLink Facility, the Plaquemine Natural Gas Plant, is located within the worst-case release distance of the Plaquemine NGL Fractionation Plant; however, EnLink has completed an assessment of control of the two facilities and determined that the Plaquemine Natural Gas Plant does not constitute an off-site receptor.  The Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance which led to off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor, and the Facility coordinates emergency response procedures with the local fire department.  Therefore, the Plaquemine NGL Fractionation Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\n\n\nThe Plaquemine NGL Fractionation Plant employs seventeen (17) full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \n\n\n\nThe Plaquemine NGL Fractionation is a new facility planned to begin operations September 2014.  This is the first RMP that EnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink) is submitting for this Facility.    \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a policy of safe NGL treatment and separation operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associ"

NGL is a regulated flammable mixture that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  After additional processing, the Facility also generates and stores, for off-site transfer, other products extracted from the NGL.  The following list details the Facility inventory of RMP-regulated materials, as well as the largest vessel of each material.  \n\n\n\nFLAMMABLE MATERIAL FACILITY INVENTORY\n\n\n\nSubstance \n\nNGL (Propane (22%); Ethane (22.5%); N-Butane (27.5%); Isobutane (12.5%); Isopentane (8.5%); N-Pentane (6%); Methane (1%)): Maximum Inventory 441,810 lbs; Largest vessel 145,152 lbs;\n\nEthane (Ethane (95%); Methane (3%); Propane (2%)): Maximum Inventory 111,661 lbs; Largest vessel 72,928 lbs;\n\nPropane (Propane (95%); Ethane (2%); Isobutane (3%)): Maximum Inventory 432,760 lbs; Largest vessel 76,746 lbs; and\n\nButane (N-Butane (97%);  Isobutane (3%)): Maximum Inventory 103,826 lbs; Largest vessel 59,403 lbs                   \n\n\n\nEnLink has completed an assessment of materials stored at the Facility and determined that no RMP-regulated toxics are present above threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBecause the Facility is regulated under RMP Program Level 1, it is not subject to the RMP Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68.  However, the Facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

However, the Facility does maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance for emergencies expected at the Facility. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained. Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated emergency response with the Iberville Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) and the Plaquemine Fire Department, which is also designated as the first responder in the event of flammable material release.   \n\n\n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility, along with their PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nThe Plaquemine NGL Fractionation Plant has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Facility was completed in March 2013.  Various action items were identified during the PHA to improve Facility safety, including installing additional safety controls on valves, installing alarm systems and automatic shutdown systems, installing product detectors, and additional engineering and operational controls.  The Facility completes maintenance checks, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and incident investigations to identify changes to improve safety."
