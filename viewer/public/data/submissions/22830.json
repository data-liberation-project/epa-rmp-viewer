Seq.  The regulations are also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 68.  \n\nFoster Farms Dairy prepared this RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Foster Farms Dairy has incorporated state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility as part of system modifications and upgrades.  Foster Farms Dairy will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP. \n\nThe Foster Farms Dairy at 415 Kansas Avenue in Modesto, California is located in an area zoned for commercial and industrial use.  The facility is near Highway 99, which runs north and south through Modesto.  Foster Farms Dairy is a family owned business that processes milk into fluid milk, powdered milk, and butter and packages fruit juices.  Foster Farms Dairy purchased the facility in 1988. Knudsen formerly owned the facility.  The facility has undergone significant modifications since 1988 and the majority of the ammonia refrigeration system components are l"

      "SummaryText": "ess than 12 years old.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in two refrigeration systems (\"A\" and \"B\").  Each system contains approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems.  The refrigeration systems provide cooling to the cold storage rooms, milk silos, glycol chillers, and air conditioning systems.  The cold rooms are used to store product. Some of the \"A\" side milk silos are jacketed with ammonia coils and store refrigerated milk and fruit juice concentrate.  The glycol chillers supply cooled liquid to processing units and other equipment for refrigeration of raw materials.  The \"A\" system provides refrigeration for the liquid products operations.  The \"B\" system provides refrigeration for powdered processing and other operations.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by an RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Foster Farms Dairy facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined in the regulations) and an alternative release scenario.  A worst-case release scenario is defined by the regulations as: \"\u00bfthe greatest amount held in a single vessel\u00bfreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThe largest ammonia vessels at the Foster Farms Dairy, the high-pressure receivers, each have a maximum capacity of 20,000 pounds of ammonia. The estimated maximum quantity of ammonia used in each system is only 16,000 pounds; therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of approximately 16,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the high-pressure receiver is required for this scenario to occur.  Assuming pessimistic atmosp"

This distance is slightly different than previously reported due to the use of atmospheric data more representative of the site.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the worst-case release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.  SLAB has been revised and updated by the USAF Engineering and Services Center and the American Petroleum Institute.  SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nFoster Farms Dairy used the alternative release scenario for ammonia described in the EPA's Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998, for an ammonia release from the Complex.  The release scenario is described as a \u00bc-inch effective diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.  The evaluation used a release rate of 79.4 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is approximately 0.08 miles.  The release rate and predicted distance are slightly different than previously reported due to the use of atmospheric data more representative of the site. The SLAB Model was used for modeling the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.

A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration systems.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly and periodic inspection, calibration, testing and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.  The computerized system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. The Foster Farms Dairy facility at 415 Kansas Avenue reported two accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years: August 2000 and September 2000.
