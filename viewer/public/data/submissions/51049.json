Anhydrous ammonia is used in the plant refrigeration system and, since inventory exceeds 10,000 pounds, PSM Regulations are applicable to this facility.\n\nOperations present a risk to both onsite (employees) and offsite receptors (the public).  It is the Company's policy to minimize negative impact upon both groups by maintaining a constant vigil on its operations, with planning and prevention being essential components of its efforts.\n\nThe employee's appreciation of the dangers associated with anhydrous ammonia begins during New Employee Orientation and continues throughout the term of employment.  Empolyees are major stakeholders in safe operations and are actively involved in developing and implementing the PSM Program.  Periodic, timely training emphasizing concepts needed to ensure personal safety and proper reaction to emergency situations further demonstrates the Company's commitment to safe operations.  In-plant monitoring of key areas provides a safe work environment along with adequate warning of any threat to employees' safety; changes in operation require evaluation of relevant safety issues.\n\nThe public is well served through the Company's close involvement with local emergency response organizations.  Plant management works with incident response personnel as needed.  Public notification procedures have been developed.  \n\nThe Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) has been completed for present operating conditions for plant personnel information only.  \n\nEmployee awareness might be the single most important factor in minimizing accidental releases to the atmosphere, and the Company strives to keep awareness levels at the highest by mandating periodic employee training.  Staff are actively involved with programs designed to protect the work environment - the PSM Program, for example, provi"

Equipment designs employ \"Best Engineering Practices\" and conservative safety factors.  Safe work practices are formalized, and change is evaluated for its impact on safety.\n\nThe Company is a willing partner with local emergency response agencies and other governmental offices, providing the system to protect public health in the event of a release.\n\nHas the effort been a success?  There has not been a notable accidental release of ammonia during the past fifteen years.  Still, plans to constantly review and improve performance are in place.  A recent audit of the PSM Program identified several ways in which our operations could be improved, and the Company reacted positively to those suggestions.  Standard operating procedures are reviewed periodically.  Management of Change analyses precede installation of new equipment.  Opportunities for enhancing staff capability will continue to be made available.\n\nClement-Pappas\" Mountain Home Plant is committed to maintaining its status as a welcomed member of this community."
