Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAs stated in our Worldwide Health, Safety and Environmental Policy and Principles, Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc. is committed to health, safety and environmental excellence.  To accomplish this we integrate health, safety and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risk, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operation or buisiness objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state thate safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nThis plant makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes a formaldehyde manufacturing facility and three resin reactors.  Although we sell some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for both types of resins.  Aqua ammonia is used in small amounts as a raw material for urea-formaldehyde resins.\n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde                   1,269,000 lbs\nAmmonia                          28,000 lbs\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety mangement program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.

This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control chicksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Senior Plant Engineer has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nProcess Stewards are assigned to maintain and inmprove the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping opeation procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operation Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operation Guide as a training tool and for reference.  By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  As a result of initial process hazard review, a significant investment was made in process control systems.  In the formaldehyde plant, an automatic shutdown system is installed that will shut down the plant before a release occurs if safe operating conditions cannot be maintained.  For the phenol-formaldehyde resin process, an automated control system will take several levels of action to prevent a release upon operator error or equipment failure.  For the urea-formaldehyde resin reactor, automated control valves and improved procedures reduce the risk of a release.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.

Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and the plant manager.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact.  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant changeis made.\n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule and other corrrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain the ongoing integrity and reliability of the facility equipment.  Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed.  The schedule is based on plant experience to redue the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measrues for welkding or other hot work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to breif them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs thhat impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have casued a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and f"

Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five year period from June 21, 1999 and June 21, 2004 there were no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage as a result of an accidental release of a regulated substance from our processes.\n\n5. Emergency response program\n\nThe plant Emergency Response Plan describes procedures for actual and threatened releases, including coordination with fire department responders.  This plan is written in the One Plan format to satisfy regulatory requirements of several agencies.  An emergency response drill is conducted annually to test the Emergency Response Plan and reinforce training that plant responders receive.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve Safety\n\nThe plant is replacing its formaldehyde storage tanks and upgrading its phenol-formaldehyde resin reactor."
