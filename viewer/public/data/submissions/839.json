The Facility Policy\n\n         The owner and employees of Delta Supply, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n 2. Facility Information\n\n         - The primary activity of the facility is the blending and storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\n         - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by farmers.\n\n         - The maximum quantity stored would be 75,000 pounds in our 10,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tractor-trailer with a capacity of 30,000 pounds.\n\n 3. The worst-case release scenario.\n\n         a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.   The maximum quantity released would be 75,000 pounds (85% of tank's capacity).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n 4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n         Delta Supply has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n 5.  The five year accident history\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n         -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\n\n         -  nor to our knowledge have resulted in "

The Emergency Response Program\n\n        - The facility has:\n\n         a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n         b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title  III  (EPCRA).\n\n         c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n 7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n          Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
