The team is capable of affecting all control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate the incident.\n\nA written Emergency Response Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.  This plan includes Pre-Emergency Planning with Outside Agencies (Buffalo Fire Department), Personnel Roles and Lines of Incident Command Authority, Facility Hazard Analysis and Emergency Prevention, Safe Distances and Places of Refuge, Site Security and Control, Evacuation Routes and Procedures, Decontamination Procedures, provisions for Emergency Medical Treatment, Emergency Notification Procedures, Chemical Response Procedures and Post Incident Response Critique.\n\nAll Tyson team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately.  Supervisors are taught to report the above to the Safety or Maintenance department immediately for further investigation.  Actions requiring a Hazmat team will be by Mollenberg-Betz/National Vacuum HAZMAT responders and if necessary, the Buffalo NYFD will also assist with in the response.  MSDS information books are accessible to all Tyson team members and outside HAMAT Responders for review.\n     \n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n     Continued Inspection of equipment and replacement thereof as needed.\n\n7.  Process Safety Information is updated for each Tyson Foods' project that is not a Like-In-Kind replacement; PSI is due and was updated prior to performing the PHA for Evaporator Installation project."
