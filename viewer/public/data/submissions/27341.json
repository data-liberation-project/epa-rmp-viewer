Any non-compliance\r\nissue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nOsage Cooperative Elevator truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention\r\nis a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\r\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\r\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\r\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n  5. Five-year Accident History\r\nOsage Cooperative Elevator has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the\r\nlast 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred\r\nduring this period.\r\n  \r\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nOsage Cooperative Elevator maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental\r\nreleases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first\r\naid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Osage Cooperative\r\nElevator will contact local emergency response agencies and the public (Appendix A).

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Osage Cooperative in Osage, IA are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We also coordinate our\r\nresponse efforts with the Osage Community Fire Department, which provides emergency response\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in a 15,000-gallon tank, a 30,000-gallon tank, as well as several nurse tanks at our\r\nfacility in Osage, IA (Figure 1).  The standard maximum possible amount of ammonia stored at this\r\nfacility at 85% is 498,197 lbs which would include the maximum storage capacity of all nurse tanks\r\nand the two large fixed tanks.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\r\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed,"
