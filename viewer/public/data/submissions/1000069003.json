The MAWC Central Plant, located on the Missouri River in Chesterfield, serves customers in Central and West St. Louis County, and has the capacity to produce 217 million gallons of drinking water per day.  Chlorine, a disinfectant used in the water treatment process, is covered under OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  MAWC complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.  It is MAWCs policy to conduct our business in accordance with applicable environmental, safety and health laws and regulations.  Management fully supports efforts to safely manage process risks to prevent incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  In conducting our business, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.  We promote continuous improvement through business planning, ongoing training, and constant oversight of operations.  We take safety seriously and have comprehensive accident prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place.  MAWCs Environmental Policy emphasizes continuous improvement of our environmental performance while providing our services in a manner that prevents pollution and promotes sustainability.  \n\n\n\nCHLORINE SYSTEM\n\n\n\nChlorine is used to purify drinking water.  It is an important chemical that disinfects against disease producing organisms, and is used in the treatment of 98% of U.S. drinking water.  Missouri American Water Company (MAWC) has safely used chlorine as part of our water treatment process since the early 1900s.  We continue to operate well within the guidelines set by EPA and other regulatory authorities.  Due to the hazards of chlorine"

The chlorine system at the plant is designed for safety.  We follow Chlorine Institute Standards and use only equipment and materials certified for chlorine service.  Remote isolation, and safety relief valves, as well as a vacuum system, are utilized to prevent leaks.  A process hazard analysis is performed and reviewed regularly to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with the chlorine system.  Procedures and systems are in place to operate safely.  Comprehensive operating procedures provide clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Process safety information is available to all employees and includes information related to chlorine hazards, such as Safety Data Sheets, process technology, and process equipment.   Operators are formally trained to operate the chlorine process safely, and receive classroom as well as on-the-job instruction.  Procedures are followed to ensure proper management of changes to the system and a safety review is performed prior to startup of new or modified equipment.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day and the process is continuously monitored using state-of-the-art computerized instrumentation and operator oversight.  Environmental and safety audits are conducted regularly, and corrective action follow-up is performed.  A preventive and corrective maintenance program ensures the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system, and includes procedures for equipment inspection, testing and repair.  Employees receive specialized training to perform chlorine system maintenance.  A contractor safety program is in place to ensure contractors are qualified and trained"

Employees and contractors must also adhere to established safe work practices and permit requirements whenever work is performed on or near the chlorine process.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Missouri American Water Company Central Plant experienced a chlorine release on May 2, 2003.  The release resulted in a loss of approximately 1,800 pounds of chlorine to the environment (air).  There were no off-site injuries or property damage, however two facility employees were treated for minor injuries by the company physician.  There was significant damage to the chlorine room at the plant resulting in approximately $60,000.00 of repair costs.  An incident investigation was initiated immediately and the cause of the release was determined to be operator error that occurred during the chlorine ton container connection process.  All applicable regulatory agencies were notified immediately and on December 1, 2003, we received a formal Notice of Compliance from EPA Region VII indicating we made the necessary notifications required under CERCLA Section 103 or EPCRA Section 304.  There were no other chlorine releases during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is designed to protect employee and public health and the environment.  Our emergency action plan consists of detailed emergency response procedures, and is updated on a yearly basis.  Missouri American Water Company works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire and police departments, St. Louis County Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Team and other first responder agencies.  We conduct regular drills with community emergency responders in order to practice and improve our emergency response plans.  In the event of a real emergency, local authorities have plans in place to communicate with the public regarding response and protection actions.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn the Fall 200"

The system has been set-up that if chlorine is detected by our chlorine analyzers, the scrubber system automatically goes into service.  The new systems greatly reduce the potential for a chlorine leak.\n\n"
