SACHEM has participated in the voluntary OSHCON program for the last 25 years. \r\n\r\n     As previously mentioned, SACHEM manufactures specialty chemicals and the chemicals that are on site above threshold quantities are methyl chloride, trimethylamine, ethyl chloride and formaldehyde. Methyl chloride and formaldehyde are on the toxic list, while trimethylamine and ethyl chloride are on the flammable list.  Methyl chloride and trimethylamine worst case scenarios impact off-site receptors using the OCA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.  There are written operating procedures with high level alarms that prevent more than 80% of the designed capacity to be stored in these tanks.  Both formaldehyde and ethyl chloride were evaluated, but methyl chloride and trimethylamine resulted in the worst case scenario with the farthest impact to offsite receptors.\r\nFor the alternative release scenario (ARS), the storage tank was assumed to overpressure causing the pressure relief valve to vent the excess pressure.  The ARS for trimethylamine and methyl chloride impacted off-site receptors using the OCA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.  Trimethylamine and methyl chloride are liquefied compressed gasses and kept under pressure for storage at ambient temperature.  The pressure relief valves are installed to prevent the worst case scenario.  They are designed to relieve the pressure prior to tank failure. The alternative release scenario (ARS) for the other toxic onsite, formaldehyde is the release from puncture and release of the entire contents of our largest container (330 gallon tote).  This would be the most likely scenario to occur.  Assuming a tote was punctured and the entire contents (2900 pounds) were released.

We provide high purity chemicals and services worldwide to electronics, catalysts, and pharmaceutical markets and to most major chemical manufacturers.  The company was started in Austin in 1950, expanded to the current bulk production facility at Cleburne in 1990, a facility in Wuxi, China and acquired a facility in Zaltbommel, Netherlands.  SACHEMs Mission Statement and SACHEM Americas' Integrated Management System policy is the framework for our commitment to continual improvement in all our activities, including Quality, Responsible Care(EHS&S), Sustainability, and Ethical performance. We commit to comply, at a minimum, with all applicable laws and regulations in the communities, states, and countries in which we operate, as well as other obligations we accept. Continual improvement of the effectiveness and performance of our Management System and the prevention of pollution are driven by our Corporate Mission and the SACHEM Way. We will share our efforts and our performance with stakeholders/interested parties, and consider their input, as appropriate. By committing ourselves to the Responsible Care Guiding Principles we acknowledge the privilege we have been given to operate in the Austin and Cleburne communities. We also commit to protect our property and associates, and to continuously improve our product stewardship.  This speaks to Safety, Health and Environmental stewardship being a precondition to anything that we do.  All associates operate under that philosophy.  We work hard every single day to be a safe, environmentally friendly neighbor and we are involved in many voluntary programs at the local, state and federal level.  We are proactive in various civic activities in Cleburne and are active members of the Johnson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

We are members the ACC (American Chemical Council).  As members of ACC, SACHEM has implemented the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practices and Guiding Principles.  Some of the key Guiding Principles are:  1.) To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations, 2.) To make health, safety, security and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new products and processes, and 3.) To operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public. \r\n\tProcess Safety Management (PSM) is also part of SACHEM's daily operating philosophy.  PSM includes the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, compliance audits, and trade secrets.  The hazards of the chemicals are found in the Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which SACHEM retains, for each chemical it has on site.  \r\n\r\n     Operator training is a major undertaking at SACHEM.  Before a new operator is allowed to operate a process, he goes through extensive training. There are operating associates on-site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ensuring that the plant is operating in a safe manner.  Daily leak checks and inspections are performed on all process piping, reaction vessels and storage tanks.  All process equipment and storage vessels have safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutoff devices and relief valves and continuous computer monitoring to prevent problems.  There are yearly integrity inspections on vessels, piping and electrical eq"

Other systems in place to manage the risk include daily visual inspection of the storage tanks, daily raw material inventory, contractor safety training, preventive maintenance program, and incident investigations on all near misses.\r\nThe five-year accident history shows that there have been no RMP reportable accidents in the 30 years SACHEM has been in Cleburne.  This means there have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or property damage and no off-site deaths, hospitalizations, medical treatment, evacuation, sheltering-in-place, property damage and environmental damage, which includes fish or animal kills, tree, lawn, shrub, or crop damage, water contamination, or soil contamination.\r\nSACHEM's Emergency Response Program was developed with input from the Cleburne Fire Department, local LEPC, and Cleburne Emergency Management officials.  If an emergency occurs, a plant wide alarm is sounded with instructions given over the intercom system.  The emergency phone number, 911, is called to inform the City of Cleburne of our needs and the type of emergency present.  If an evacuation is necessary, all associates, including contractors are gathered and roll call is taken to ensure everyone that was in the plant made it safely to the rally point.  The incident command system takes over from there.  In using this system, all the emergency groups are communicating effectively. The emergency is assessed and additional response equipment and associates are called, if required.  SACHEM has 15 associates that are HAZWOPER, Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response, trained that are available to attend to most spills.  We have a 24-hour emergency responder contracted to help us in an emergency, if needed.  The Cleburne Police Department will assist SACHEM if evacuation or sheltering in place is required.
