      "SummaryText": "1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1    SOURCE\nThe Roberts Dairy located in Des Moines, Iowa, is subject to the USEPAs \nRisk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation \n(40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than \nthe threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \n(CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient \nconditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to \ncontrol the processing and storage temperature for milk, juice, cream, and \nflavored drinks.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 13,000 \npounds (i.e., 2,400 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, \nliquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure \nreceiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much \nas 5,011 pounds of liquid ammonia.  However, during typical operation, \nthe vessel holds only about 2,000 pounds.  Most of the ammonia \nequipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, \nand some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \npiping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by \nsmell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Roberts Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage system.  \nThe high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (150 to 180 psig) liquid \nammonia to a recirculator.  The recirculator provides high-pressure \nammonia to all of the cooling units via dual liquid pumps.  The cooling \nunits include the following:  glycol chillers (2), cooler evaporators (9), #6 \nand #7 V"

A high-level pumper drum returns liquid ammonia from the \nrecirculator to the receiver.  Ammonia vapor is returned to six high-stage \ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas), at 150 to 180 psig, is vented to four evaporative condensers.  The \ncondensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room \nventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the \ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drum, and recirculator from \nthe hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high \npressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \nwell as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts \nfor the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n2.0    POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of \nammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from \nleaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent \nreleases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact \nemployees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or \nrepresent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined \nrelease scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were \nanalyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the \nammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  This \nendpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below whic"

This guidance document used \nthe SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup \ntables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the \nendpoint distance.\n\n2.1    WORST-CASE RELEASE\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic \nrupture and complete loss of the maximum contents of the high pressure \nreceiver (approximately 5,011 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute \nperiod.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the \nModel Plan, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was \nestimated to be 4,504 feet or 0.85 miles.\n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it \nshould be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and \noperation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is \nextremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict \naccordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) \nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and \nstamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National \nBoard).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessels \ncondition occurs annually by a boiler and machinery insurance inspector \nwho has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is \ninspected daily by a plant facility mechanic, trained in the operation of the \nsystem.\n\nThere are only two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment \nof the high pressure receiver:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase \nuncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; "

Such \npressures could not be generated internally.  The only logical external \ncause of high pressure would be flame impingement or surface radiation \nfrom a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this were to occur, the \nvessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to relieve internal \npressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long \nas the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV would result in an \nammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative-\nrelease scenario.  The SRVs are replaced every five years, in accordance \nwith the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance \ncontained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety \nAmmonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly \nwhen required.\n\nFurther, rupture of the vessel from the outside as a result of inadvertent \ncontact (e.g., vehicular) is unlikely since the unit is provided with \nsubstantial barrier protection to preclude this occurrence.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional \nreasons:\n\n? The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario \nare uncommon;\n\n? Only rarely, if ever, are the contents of the system intentionally \npumped back to the receiver.  Typically, the receiver contains only \n2,000 pounds.\n\n? Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of these receivers;\n\n?

Inadvertent vehicular contact with the vessel is not possible since there \nis no vehicular access to the unit.\n\n2.2    ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE\nThe alternative, or more likely, scenario is considered to be defined by a \nrelease of ammonia through a 1?4-inch effective diameter hole in a high side \n(i.e., 150 psig) pipe or vessel, releasing 100 pounds of ammonia per minute \nfor up to 60 minutes.  This release is representative of a small pipe or \nvessel leak.  It would also be representative of a flange leak or pump seal \nfailure.  Because some piping is located outdoors, passive (building) \nmitigation  was not used to reduce the release rate or the distance to the \nendpoint.
