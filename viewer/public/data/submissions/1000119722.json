      "SummaryText": "1. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\n\n1.1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Kraft Heinz Foods Company (Kraft) owns and operates a food manufacturing facility located in Garland, Dallas County, Texas (Garland Facility). The facility has registered a risk management plan (RMP). Pursuant to the RMP rule, a 5 year renewal of the RMPlan is being submitted for the anhydrous ammonia system. There are no changes to the process or operations. \n\nThe Kraft Garland Facility manufactures barbecue sauces and vinegar. The site also packages skillet products and Lunchables products at the facility. The facility NAICS code is 311941, Mayonnaise, Dressing, and other Prepared Sauce manufacturing. The Kraft Garland Facility's main business is the confection and elaboration of food ingredients into consumer-packaged finished goods, including their distribution to warehouses and customers.  These currently include shelf stable condiment sauce, and refrigerated and unrefrigerated packaged meals. The storage and process areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve the products.  Kraft has one 40 CFR 68 (RMP Rule) regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia (ammonia, CAS No. 7664-41-7).  Ammonia is used at the facility to refrigerate raw materials and finished food products and to provide climate control.\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a RMP, and submit the RMP to EPA.  Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004.  Ammonia is regulated under 40 CFR 68, more commonly known as the Risk Management Program rule.  RMP plans must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130.  The threshold quantity for regulation of ammonia is 10,00"

      "SummaryText": "0 pounds.   The facility stores and uses 71,000 lbs of ammonia, therefore, it is subject to the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare an RMP.  \n\n1.2. RMP REQUIREMENTS\nAll facilities subject to the RMP rule must complete a hazard assessment analysis for the regulated chemical.  In addition, the recent (5-year) accident history and emergency response plan must be reviewed.  Based on these assessments, the facility will be classified within one of three program levels:\n\n>\tProgram 1 - no offsite receptor impacted (potentially and in last five years)\n>\tProgram 2 - offsite impacts and not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard (OSHA PSM)\n>\tProgram 3 - offsite impacts and subject to OSHA PSM \n\nAll programs require submittal of an RMPlan.  For Program 2 and 3 processes, two additional tasks are required: a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The following sections provide a brief summary of the hazard assessment, accident history, prevention program, emergency response, and subsequent RMP program level determination for the Garland facility.\n\n1.3. HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThree possible ammonia processes were identified as having the largest potential impact should a spill occur: the receiver, the piping gasket and the pump seal.  The rupture of the receiver was identified to be the worst-case release scenario since it will result the largest spill surface area.  For the worst-case release scenario, the maximum distance to the level of concern is 2.3 miles.  The rupture of a pressure relief device was evaluated as the alternative scenario resulting in a maximum distance to the level of concern shorter than 0.1 mile.  Details on the hazard assessment are provided in Section 2.\n\n1.4. RECEPTORS IMPACTED\nOnce the impact distance of the worst-case release scenario is examined, the impact on off-site receptors must be considered.  If public receptors or environmental receptor"

      "SummaryText": "s are impacted, additional analysis is required. The distance from the release point to the fence line is approximately 600 ft. (0.11 miles).  Therefore, the level of concern (2.3 miles) extends past the fence line to off-site locations, and any unrestricted areas within this region must be evaluated to determine if public or environmental receptors are impacted.  The evaluation shows that there are environmental receptors located within the impact radius.  Details on the receptors impacted are provided in Section 2.5.\n\n1.5. ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere are no accidents to report for either the five year accident history (40 CFR \u00a768.42) or for determining Program 1 applicability (40 CFR \u00a768.10(b)(1)).\n\n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nA facility emergency response plan for the Garland facility is in place and emergency response efforts have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations as required by 40 CFR \u00a768.10(b)(3).\n\n1.7. PROGRAM LEVEL\nAmmonia storage at the Garland facility qualifies as a Program 3 process since, based on the offsite consequence analysis, the maximum distance to the level of concern impacts public receptors, and the process is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard (29 CFR \u00a71910.119) because the amount of ammonia (71,000 lbs) present at the Garland facility exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs).  \n\n1.8. RMPLAN\nRenewal of an RMPlan is required for all covered processes by the anniversary renewal date.  A 5 year renewal of the RMPlan is being submitted to United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) via Central Data Exchange (CDX) on February 3,2025.  Upon submittal of the RMPlan, no additional submittals will be required by Kraft Garland facility under RMP until:\n\n1.\tAn accidental release of ammonia with offsite impacts occurs;\n2.\tProcess changes might reasonably be expected to change the distance to the level of concern by a factor of two or more;\n3.\tA change occurs at or near facility that requir"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT \nSince the Garland facility is subject to RMP, a hazard assessment must be performed.  The first step of the hazard assessment is a worst-case analysis to determine the maximum potentially affected area.  Should offsite receptors be impacted in the worst-case analysis, additional alternative case analyses are required.\n\n2.1. WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\nA \"worst-case release\" is defined under 40 CFR \u00a768.3 as:\n\n\"... the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(a).\"\n\nThe worst-case scenario quantity is determined in 40 CFR \u00a768.25(b) as the greatest amount in any single vessel or pipe used in a covered process, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.\n\nThe term \"process\" is defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.3 as:\n\n\"... any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities. For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\"\n\nThe definition of \"process\" is broad and can be interpreted to include all equipment handling a regulated substance.  Three processes components at the Garland facility contain ammonia:\n\n1. HV-5 Accumulator/Intercooler\n \n2.1.1. RECEIVER\nThe largest potential release of ammonia will occur with a puncture in the receiver of the plant.  Because of interconnecting pipe work and other vessels that can discharge into this pipe work, the"

      "SummaryText": "amount of ammonia released will be greater than the amount stored in the receiver.  The total amount of ammonia release is assumed as the total ammonia present at the facility, which is 36,101 lbs. \n\n2.2. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS\nDuring a spill of toxic chemicals, the evaporation rate and atmospheric dispersion are a function of ambient meteorological conditions.  The meteorological parameters for the worst case scenario are defined by 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as having a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and the atmospheric stability Class F.  An ambient temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) (77 degrees Fahrenheit [\u00b0F]).  \n\n2.3. SOURCE EVAPORATION RATES\nThe Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) contains assumptions for both the release rate and distance to endpoint calculations for a toxic liquid release.  The release rate was calculated using the method in the OCA Guidance for toxic liquid release to a diked area, but since the OCA guidance tables and numbers are not updated, RMP*Comp was used for the hazard assessment analysis.  Since the evaporation is a function of many variables, such as liquid pool temperature, vapor pressure, and solution concentration, a heat and mass transfer model can better quantify ammonia evaporation rates.\n\n2.4. DISPERSION MODELING ANALYSIS\nThe dispersion modeling analysis for accidental ammonia release into the ambient air is evaluated with the RMP*Comp program.  Beside the release and meteorological conditions discussed above, the analysis also utilized the urban ground surface roughness since the Garland facility is located in an urban area.  The modeled Distance-To- Endpoint was 1.3 miles.  \n\n2.5. OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT\nAfter the distance to the toxic endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors, and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule.  The population within a circle centered at the point of release and a radi"

In addition, all types of public receptors (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas or arenas, major commercial or industrial areas) and environmental receptors (national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; federal wilderness areas) within this distance should be identified.\n\nMARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks, Version 5.1.1) was used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the toxic endpoint and to identify public receptors.  MARPLOT provides databases from the Bureau of Census, and other federal agencies.  The demographic information in MARPLOT is based on the 2010 Census.\n\nMARPLOT shows that a total population of 67,727 and total housing units of 22,507 are within the 2.3 mile impact radius for the worst case release.  Google Earth (Version 7.3.3.7786) was used to find the public receptors within the impact radius for the worst case scenario. Since there are offsite receptors that are impacted in the worst-case analysis, an additional alternative case analysis is required.\n\n2.6. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO RELEASE ANALYSIS \nThe release was considered a gaseous release over a duration of 30 minutes through a pressure relief valve. The site of the leak is a 1 \u00bc\u0094 x 1 \u00bd\u0094 Hansen H5604 pressure relief valve set at 250 psig on Screw Compressor #6 located on the southeast exterior corner of the facility. The failure would result in the release of approximately 89.01 lb./min of anhydrous ammonia into the environment during the 30-minute timeframe. \n\nThe dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative scenario related to an accidental ammonia release into the ambient air is evaluated with the RMP*Comp program.  The meteorological parameters for the alternative scenario are defined by 40 CFR \u00a768.28(b) as having a win"

Beside the release and meteorological conditions, the analysis also utilized the urban ground surface roughness.  The modeled Distance-To- Endpoint was shorter than 0.1 mile and is reported as 0.1 mile.  \n\nAfter the distance to the toxic endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors, and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule.  MARPLOT (Version 5.1.1) is used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the toxic endpoint and to identify public receptors.  As can be seen from the map, the facility fence line to the release point is beyond the 0.1 mile radius; thus, there are no public and environmental receptors impacted by the alternative release scenario.\n\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nPer the requirements of the RMP rule, Kraft must include a five-year accident history in the Risk Management Plan.  The five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from a covered process in the five years prior to the submission of the Risk Management Plan.  To be reportable, the release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n\n1.\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n2.\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nNo accidental releases have occurred in the past five years at the Kraft Garland facility.\t\n\n4. PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Garland Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  The following section briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at Kraft Garland facility.\n\n4.1.

All chemical substances present at the Site are identified and Safety Sheets (SDS) are available for each employee to review.  \n\n4.2. PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nThe Garland Facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodologies that are used to carry out these analyses are What If and Map/Diagram Review.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n4.3. OPERATING PROCEDURES\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activates within the covered processes, the Garland Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n4.4. TRAINING\nThe Garland Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided every three years or more frequently, as needed.  \n\n4.5. MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Garland facility carries out highly documented implementation procedures to maintain the integrity of process equipment.  The facility also conducts regular inspections and maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined during these checks includes, receivers and condensers, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by these checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The quality assurance for mechanical integrity is addressed for new construction & equipment, newly installed equipment, maintenance materials, and spare parts & equipment.\n\n4.6. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Garland facility implements highly documented procedures to meet both the corporate and regulatory requirements for Management of change (MOC).  The MOC procedures apply to both permanent and temporary changes and include changes pertaining to the process, chemicals, equipment, and technology; as well as facility, emergency, well operations and general operations; and newly assigned personnel (e.g., new position, new function, or different work location).  The MOC procedures provide the mechanism to ensure that modifications or additions to existing facilities have been identified, reviewed, risk assessed, communicated, documented, and approved prior to implementation of the change or addition.\n\n4.7. PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\nThe Garland facility conducts pre-startup safety review for new stationary sources or modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in safety information.  The facility confirms that new or modified construction and equipment meet design specifications and adequate procedures are performed to ensure that procedures for safety, operating, maintenance, and emergencies are adequate and in place.  For any new and modified stationary source, appropriate safety review is conducted for any associated PHA and MOC requirement.  Each employee involved in the process has been trained completely.  \n\n4.8.
