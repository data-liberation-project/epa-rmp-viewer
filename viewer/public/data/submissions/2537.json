Our employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.                                                                                      This facility doesfarm supply sales. Anhydrous ammonia is received,  stored, and redistributed as a valuable fertilizer resource for our farm customers to grow food. Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 140,196 pounds or 16,800 gallons in a 30,000 gallon capacity tank.   The worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 PPM at3.52miles from the tank. Due to the location of the tank and the complex. There would be minimal impact to off-site personnel. The maximum release would be at 290000 lb.                                    As an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 PPM at .46 miles from the tank. Again it would have minimal impact off-site as the gas would barely escape the boundaries of our property.                                                              We have instituted procedures for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as required by OSHA AND The Indiana State Chemist into our plan.                                                                                                     We have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past.                         Our Emergency Response Plan is up to date and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures. All new hires will receive training as part of their new employee orientation.                              It is the policy of Jasper Co.
