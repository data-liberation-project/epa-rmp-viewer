      "SummaryText": "ce polyurethane foam for the diaper, automotive, and many other specialty foam markets.  Polyurethane foam is manufactured by combining specific ratios of chemical streams in a mixing chamber where the reacting ingredients are dispensed onto a moving conveyor system.  The reacting mixture cures into the form of a slabstock bun.  The foam buns are fabricated into spools, rolls, and other specialty parts.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by the EPA's risk management rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by rail car and on rare occasions, by tanker truck; it is stored in nine tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 566,127 pounds.\n\n3.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\nSafety Information\nHazard reviews of our processes\nOperator procedures\nTraining\nEquipment Maintenances Program\nRMP Compliance Audits\nAccident/Incident Investigation\nContractor Training\nHot Work Permits\nProcess Equipment Change\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn addition, we have established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines the hazards of handling Toluene Diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce the hazards of Isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community, and the environment.  Process controls also exist to minimize potential releases (e.g. tank level gauges, high level alarms, high-pressure switches, bursting disk, and system interlocks).\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

      "SummaryText": "company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4. 5-Year Accident History\n\nWITP-Chattanooga follows internal standards for risk assessment and incident investigations based off federal, state, and local regulations as well as industry standards and best practices. These standards trigger immediate reviews of the process standards and engineering/administrative controls at the time of the incident to mitigate any further observed risks. WITP-Chattanooga is committed to continuously improve and prioritize process and worker safety under the guidance of these standards.\n\nSince the last submission of the RMP, there have been two incidents involving toluene-diisocyanate at the WITP-Chattanooga facility.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, during commissioning of new equipment, a incorrect logic control deadheaded an isocyanate pipe that caused a valve body to leak evacuating roughly two gallons of the chemical. This led to three local employees to be sent for care. No public receptors were affected. Incident investigation was conducted and multiple findings were addressed as a result of the incident.  \n\nOn March 18, 2024, a faulty external gasket on a trailer flange began to leak causing roughly 7-10 gallons to be evacuated into the unloading area. It was discovered by the unloading employees and unload was immediately halted. During the investigation, it was found that the supplier used an alternative trailer source, and a claim was submitted for the equipment failure. No injuries were incurred from the incident and no public receptors were affected. WITP-Chattanooga bolstered diking in the area as a corrective action from the incident investigation. \n\n5.\tThe Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and loca"

      "SummaryText": "l regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We have coordinated our program with local emergency planning committee and the fire department.  The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department all have copies of an SDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits our plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\n\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release.  The following responses are addressed in our plan:\n\nProper Notifications in the event of a Release (internal and external)\nSystemic Shutdown of Operations\nEvacuation of Personnel\nFirst Aid Procedures\nEmergency Response Team Actions\nDecontamination of Personnel and Equipment\nManagement of Waste Material\nStart up of Operations\nAccident/Incident Investigations\n\n6.\tSafety Improvement\n\nThe Woodbridge Group strives to continually improve the health and safety of all employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  By adhering to the following policies, Woodbridge will decrease the risk of exposing personnel and the environment to Isocyanate and increase the safety awareness at the Chattanooga facility.\n\nWe actively pursue process innovation and fundamental research to prevent environmental pollution through the reduction and elimination of all forms of waste from our operations, including the reduction of energy consumption and the resultant release of greenhouse gas emissions.  The Woodbridge Group routinely review and assesses our operations for the purpose of making health, safety and environmental improvements beyond those legally required, where such enhancements provide significant benefits.\n\nLike all facilities in the Woodbridge Group, the Chatt"
