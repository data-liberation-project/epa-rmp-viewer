              "Description": "LSB is a beef processing/cold storage facility.  This facility falls under NAICS code 311612 (meat processing from carcass). Our Process Safety information was last reviewed and updated January 2, 2017 (HAZMAT Meetings are conducted every month, and Plant wide Safety meetings are conducted every three months). We are subject to handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association, American National Standards Institute, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards. These standards, and all applicable OSHA standards have been implemented here through written manuals and updates by Environmental Services Group, Inc, Safety Solution, LLC. and Process Compliance, Inc. The most recent hazard review and update conducted for this facility was May 29, 2013 and high priority corrections/recommendations were completed by December 31, 2013.  The main hazard identified during this hazard analysis was the necessity to complete a current mechainical integrity review, upgrade main plant engine room ventilation system, engine room ammonia sensors, and update all SOP procedures. To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment, and a purge system.  Operating and training procedures were last reviewed and revised on November 16, 2017 & December 1, 2017.  The employees of LSB were trained through classroom and on-the-job training.  This training is compeleted with competency tests including demonstration and observation.  The maintenance procedures are reviewed by operators on a regular basis to ensure proper operation of the refrigeration system.  The last time the PM procedures were reviewed was November 30, 2017 and the most recent equipment inspection was conducted on November 16, 2017.  LSB contracted with Safety Solutions LLC in November of 2007, who assists with the review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training. LSB also contracted Process Compliance, Inc. in May 14, 2013, who assists with review and updates of our PSM/RMP manuals, PHA revailidation, Mechancial integrity inspection, Operating and Maintenance procedures, SOP review & updates, and compliance audits. Process Compliance, Inc. completed our 3 year compliance audit on April 14, 2016 with findings to be completed by December 31, 2017. LSB is a Level 3 Prevention Program facility.  The following pages are the Prevention Program Elements to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under EPA regulations.",

The same properties that make Anhydrous Ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling Anhydrous Ammonia.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle Anhydrous Ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilized, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc., Process Compliance, Inc., and Safety Solutions LLC.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification to Phillip McQueen (Project Engineer), Shawn Berryhill (Safety Officer), San Angelo Fire Department, White Buffalo, Hilbig Services, Inc. (refrigeration company with Haz Mat trained responders) and then notifying 911 System for call-out to affected responding agencies.  We have discussed this program with all parties involved.  The San Angelo Fire and Police Departments will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Tom Green Co. LEPC.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is processing, cooling, and storing beef by utilizing Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in storage vessels located outside the Trolley Room, and east of the Main Plant engine room facility and also located outside on the North end of the Freezer Cold Storage facility. Anhydrous Ammonia is fed into the cooling systems for cold storage.  Both Main Plant & Freezer s"

      "SummaryText": "ystems are single-stage pumped re-circulated ammonia refrigeration systems.  The Single Stage Compressors serves the Freezer, Coolers, Cooler Dock, Shipping Cooler, etc. loads. Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for the compressors, liquid feed make up, air purgers, and condensing system.  Note:  The system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 2150 E. 37th Street location is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The maximum amount of Anhydrous Ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 25,000 pounds.  25,000 pounds is an aggregate found in the storage vessel and system located at the processing plant.  There is a seperate  3,500 pounds located in the storage vessel and system located in the freezer/cold storage facility, with a different mailing address, across the street. That facility was built in 2007.\n\n\n\nThis meat packing/cold storage facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1980, and underwent changes and/or additions in 2004, 2007 and 2010.  This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations to this facility."
