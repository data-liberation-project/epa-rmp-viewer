The plastic pellet products are sold to molders for end use in refrigerator and automobile interiors, medical uses, computer housings, health spas, tools, and much more. The resins are used to coat circuit boards and coat aluminum cans to allow printing on the can.\n\nTwo RMP chemicals are used in the facility, acrylonitrile and butadiene. These make up two of the three main chemicals used to make the plastic products. (The third being styrene a non-RMP chemical).\n\nAcrylonitrile is a liquid and stored in two tanks prior to being used in smaller tanks and in several plastic\n\nmanufacturing processes. Butadiene is stored under pressure in a tank. Most storage tanks have concrete dike floors and walls capable of holding more than the quantity of the material being stored. Multiple processes use these chemicals in various quantities in a process at one time. Acrylonitrile is the only toxic RMP chemical and represents the worst case scenario for toxic chemicals. Butadiene is the only flammable RMP chemical and thus represents the worst case flammable scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3A. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenario for acrylonitrile assumes the following:\n\n?Greatest quantity of acrylonitrile is released from the largest storage tank over a 10 minute period.\n\n?The relea"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there have been two incidents involving RMP chemicals in which the reportable quantity for butadiene was exceeded.  The June 18, 2018 incident was caused by packing becoming loose on a flanged connection on the D Kettle reactor.  69 lbs of Butadiene were released to the atmosphere.  \n\nThe second incident occurred on November 1, 2018.  472 lbs of butadiene were released over a 7.5 hour period of time.  The D Kettle agitator was replaced during the October turn around.  The set screws on the agitator collar were insufficiently torqued during the work.  This loosening of the collar allowed a stationary seal to move causing it to fail after a few batches.  \n\n\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has extensive emergency response capabilities and coordinates with outside agencies. Here is a summary of these capabilities.\n\n?    All employees are trained for first level emergency response.\n\n?    Trained fire brigade members are on site on all shifts that process units are operating.\n\n?    Fire truck is present on site which includes foam capability.\n\n?    Coordination exists with local Fire Departments.\n\n?    A plant siren sounds for every plant alarm. The alarm is coded to expedite response by the plant fire chief and emergency fire brigade. The alarm is tested monthly.\n\n?    The City of Addyston Mayor and police department are notified on critical fire alarms along with other facilities as needed.\n\n?    Emergency drills are conducted.\n\n?    Public can be notified of chemical accidents through civil defense sirens, emergency weather radios, loud speakers on fire department vehicles or door-to-door notification via the Addyston Emergency Operations Plan.\n\n?    Emergency communications are coordinated with local communities.\n\n\n\n7. PLANS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis facility continues to improve its safety. Here"
