      "SummaryText": "CraftMark Bakery LLC produces cookies, bread, and flatbread at our facility located in Indianapolis, IN. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\n\n\nOur facility stores and uses Anhydrous Ammonia as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is used to cool spaces and product throughout the facility.  In particular the evaporators using ammonia refrigerant cool several process areas, a large storage freezer, and several spiral freezers.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.  Although ammonia has the potential of being life threatening, our highest priority at CraftMark Bakery is to operate and monitor our facility appropriately so that the refrigeration system will pose little/no threat to the surrounding community.  \n\n\n\nAt CraftMark Bakery the ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. The pipes and vessels were designed and tested to hold pressure far exceeding the operating pressure produced at the facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is produced in the human body and is commonly found in nature. In nature, ammonia occurs in soil from bacterial processes. It is also produced when plants, animals and animal wastes decay.  Ammonia used as a refrigerant is more concentrated than what is described above.  The word 'anhydrous' means \"without water\".  Anhydrous Ammonia exists as a colorless highly irritating gas with a sharp odor. Ammonia gas is lighter than air and will rise, so that generally it does not settle in low-lying areas. However, in the presence of moisture, ammonia can form vapors that are heavier than air causing it to fall near the ground.  When ammonia enters the body as a result of breathing or skin contact, it can displace the oxygen in your lungs causing suffo"

Luckily there are warning signs; the odor is so pungent that even people, who have never been in contact with it in the past, will understand that they need to remove themselves from the area. Ammonia is not highly flammable, but containers of ammonia may become unstable exposed to high heat. As said above, the fluid is entirely and continually contained within the circuit for normal operation. The materials of containment are selected to eliminate corrosive or dissociative interactions with the refrigerant. The means of installation and assembly are applied and managed to ensure the highest levels of integrity and operational durability while providing safe and effective access for maintenance. Refrigeration system operators need detail training in the methods to make such accesses and the specific intent of a procedure before any task is undertaken.\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) that are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. The plant requirement overall is in fact a multi-tiered system of training, supervisory controls and qualifiers, tools, equipment and administrative safeguards running the spectrum from the most generic and all encompassing to the most specific. They are addressed not only to the End User's employees, but also to every person who may now or ever enter the plant.\n\n\n\nAm"

Process area room NH3 detectors are located near the evaporators. Cold Storage NH3 detectors are located within each of the rooftop penthouses. In addition, there are three ammonia detectors in the machine room.  Safety relief valves (are installed on each required pressure containing vessel safety relief valves are designed to protect vessels/piping from reaching their maximum working pressure as defined by the U1A data sheets.  The Compressor Control Panels contain many adjustable safety set points for compressor protection. For each of the safety controls, the compressor will go through a series of actions leading up to the shut down of the compressor. These actions follow the following pattern:\n\n1) Alarm - Alarm horn sounds.\n\n2) Delay - Time between when alarm first sounds and Shutdown of compressor. Should the alarm condition fall back into the desired range during this delay, the alarm horn will stop.\n\n3) Shutdown - The compressor shuts itself down. Cause for the shut down must be viewed at either the compressor GForce Panel or computer interface and rectified before machine is started back up, per SOP procedures.  \n\n\n\nAs stated before, our goal is to prevent accidental chemical releases and minimize their impact if they do occur.  No ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences. \n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.

Process Safety Information\n\nThe process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, information pertaining to the technology of the ammonia refrigeration system, and information pertaining to the equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nThe PHA was based on a generic study developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses (IARW).  The generic study was customized and supplemented with unique site-specific issues to ensure that all hazards of this particular ammonia refrigeration system were thoroughly reviewed.  This was done with a qualified PHA leader in a team format, centered on the What-If/Checklist technique.  In general, PHAs are conducted to identify hazard scenarios associated with various kinds of industrial activities.  When hazard scenarios are identified, existing/proposed designs and operations are assessed to determine if appropriate engineering/administrative controls are in place.  If the current level of protection is determined insufficient, recommendations are made to eliminate and/or mitigate the scenarios.  The specific purpose of this study was to identify hazards associated with an ammonia refrigeration system.  Hazards of interests centered on the release of anhydrous ammonia and the potential consequences to employees and surrounding areas.  This study was commissioned by CraftMark Bakery in an effort to address the PHA requirements in 29 CFR 1910.119, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.\n\n\n\n?
