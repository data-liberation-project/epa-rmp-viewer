      "SummaryText": "Diamond Central is a fruit packing plant.  We use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in our cold storage operation.  We have used ammonia as a refrigerant for more than 80 years with no release that caused a threat to our community.  Our refrigeration operators are members of The Refrigeration Engineers & Technicians Association and receive much of their technical training through this association.  They have been involved with forming this program.  Our engineers receive continual training for handling ammonia in our process.  We have complied with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program since June 1995.  We have a written emergency response plan which we woth with our local fire department in the event of a release.  A worst case release for us would be the loss of 25,540 lbs of ammonia which oculd travel 2.7 miles.  This is however unlikely in that an ammonia leak would be detected early by smell or alarm and we have a series of valves to turn off which would limit the amount of ammonia released.  Our fire department is 200 yards from our plan.  They will respons to a leak when called and they will be in charge of community safety.  Shelterling in place wil protect people most of the time until an ammonia cloud passes.  In a rare situation people may have to evacuate the area, the fire department would notify the public in that event.  In order to prevent a release of ammonia we do the following.\nA.  All ammonia processes are in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\nB.  CA rooms are equipped with ammonia detectors which sound an alarm at 25ppm.\nC.  Engine rooms and cold storages are visually inspected daily.\nD.  Compressor oil is changed and inspected yerly.\nE.  Ammonia equipment is monitored by our refrigeration engineers.\nF.  Maintenance is done as per equipment manufacturers recommendtions and per Refirgeration Engineers Technicians Associations guidelines.\nG.  State electrical inspections are done each yer."
