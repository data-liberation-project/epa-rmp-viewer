Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Butane, Propane, Ethane, Methane and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Butane, Propane, Ethane and Methane are by-products of the gas production process.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the Cogeneration Facility.\n\nThe maximum inventory of each of our products is: Butane 835680 lbs., Propane 668127 lbs., Ethane 196098 lbs., Methane 104583 lbs. and Ammonia (anhydrous) 12000 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Submit program supplied by the EPA.  Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case scenario for all of our processes is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.  However, our facility does meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 as outlined in Section 4 below.  These provide us with both the necessary administrative controls and mitigation measures necessary to limit the distances of our worst case scenarios. \n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 35R LOAP in Jan. 97.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, contro"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in Feb. 98.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.
