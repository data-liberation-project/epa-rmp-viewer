(hereafter referred to as Magi ) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Magi to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\r\n\r\n\tMagi refrigeration personnel respond to ammonia releases at a very limited level but have none the less received the training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training applicable to ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the Brewster, Pateros and Okanogan facilities have also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.  Omak's facility is a very small cold storage warehouse and as such hosts a very limited number of occasional employees at specific times of the year. With this in mind the evacuation plan for the Omak facility is simply for the one or two employees to: 1)  Leave by the closest exit,  2)  Call 911,  3)  Report the emergency situation to the Okanogan plant supervisor and 4) Inform incoming emergency responders of the situation and accountability of personnel on site."

      "SummaryText": "At Magi, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\r\n1) Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n\r\n2) Reduce the threat to our personnel\r\n\r\n3) Reduce the threat to the community\r\n\r\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nMagi owns and operates three fruit processing in combination with  four cold storage facilities located at Brewster, Pateros, Omak and Okanogan, in the county of Okanogan, the state of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at Magi is anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7). The anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\n1) There is approximately 23,215 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Brewster systems.  The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room #1 and #2, and potentially release 8,570 pounds of product.\r\n\r\n2) There is approximately 17,655 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Pateros system. The larger of the two independent systems ( South Engine Room ) could potentially release 10,009 pounds of product.\r\n\r\n3) There is approximately 23,827 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Okanogan systems. The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room 'C' and 'D' and release 7,640 pounds of product.   \r\n\r\n4) There  is  approximately  3,135 pounds  of  anhydrous ammonia  in the  Omak systems. The quantities present at this location are well below the 10,000 pound threshold and therefore does not require a RMP.  As such, Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios were not calculated.  If in the future this location increases it's capacity to the 10,000 threshold an amended RMP will be immediately submitted.  In order to provide the Omak facility and the surrounding area a higher  level of safety, many  aspects of this RMP and the related PSM have included the Omak system.\r\n\r\nMagi uses other haza"

This is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Magi Inc., headquartered at 26049 State Highway # 97, Brewster WA 98812 in conjunction with it's other facilities in the cities of Okanogan, Omak and Pateros jointly comply with Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs deal with the risks involved in the storage, handling, and processing of highly hazardous materials such as ammonia.  In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\r\n\r\n2. Magi's PSM/RMP programs enable our facility to work towards the mitigation of the occurrence and consequences of significant releases of hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of incidents.  \r\n\r\n3. Magi's PSM/RMP programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to all appropriate employees at Magi.\r\n\r\n4. Copies of the written program may be reviewed in the office of Dale Davis, in the Brewster office. \r\n\r\n5. If an employee (or any reader of this document) feel that any improvements can be made to the PSM/RMP programs, please contact Dale Davis and present your written suggestion. Magi encourages all suggestions because we are committed to the success of our PSM/RMP programs. Ma"

It is cooled by the condenser, returns to a liquid and flows into the liquid receiver.
