It includes all the required elements of RMP including maintaining Process Safety Information, Employee participation, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, EHS Operator Training, Pre-Startup Review, a Mechanical Integrity Program, Hot Work Permit program, Management of Change Program, EHS Accident Investigation, Emergency Response Plan, Compliance audits, and IST review program.\r\nThe Edison Site strives to maintain a safe working environment, it is therefore essential that employees be able to deal effectively with emergencies that may develop during the course of operations.  Therefore, a multi-functional emergency response team has been formed. The Site Emergency Response Team shall provide the actions necessary to control an emergency with the following priorities:\r\n1. To safeguard the lives of company personnel;\r\n2. To protect the well being of our visitors, contractors, truck drivers, neighbors and the community;\r\n3. To protect the environment;\r\n4. To protect company property.\r\nThe areas of responsibility include:\r\n1. Fire control;\r\n2. Hazardous materials response;\r\n3. First aid;\r\n4. Search and rescue;\r\n5. Confined space rescue;\r\n6. Trench collapse rescue;\r\n7. Evacuation;\r\n8. Security;\r\n9. Weapons of Mass Destruction/Terrorism response;\r\n10.
