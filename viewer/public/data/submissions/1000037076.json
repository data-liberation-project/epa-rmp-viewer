The sites Quality and Environmental management systems are certified for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards.\n\na)    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at the Edison site is documented in the Management System.  It includes all the required elements of RMP including maintaining Process Safety Information, Employee participation, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures, EHS Operator Training, Pre-Startup Review, a Mechanical Integrity Program, Hot Work Permit program, Management of Change Program, EHS Accident Investigation, Emergency Response Plan, Compliance audits, and IST review program.\n\nThe Edison Site strives to maintain a safe working environment, it is therefore essential that employees be able to deal effectively with emergencies that may develop during the course of operations.  Therefore, a multi-functional emergency response team has been formed. The Site Emergency Response Team shall provide the actions necessary to control an emergency with the following priorities:\n\n1. To safeguard the lives of company personnel;\n\n2. To protect the well being of our visitors, contractors, truck drivers, neighbors and the community;\n\n3. To protect the environment;\n\n4. To protect company property.\n\nThe areas of responsibility include:\n\n1. Fire control;\n\n2. Hazardous materials response;\n\n3. First aid;\n\n4. Search and rescue;\n\n5. Confined space rescue;\n\n6. Trench collapse rescue;\n\n7. Evacuation;\n\n8. Security;\n\n9. Weapons of Mass Destruction/Terrorism response;\n\n10. Community relations.\n\nIt is the Edison Sites policy to cooperate fully with Local, State and Federal agencies to mitigate any emergency while protecting the well being of our employees, neighbors, and the environment.

Management of Change assures that all changes are reviewed for their hazards before implementation and considers the need for process safety equipment, mitigation equipment, and leak detection systems.  All incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents.\n\nd) The five-year accident history\n\nThere has been on"
