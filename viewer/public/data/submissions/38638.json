The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility\n\nDescribe your facility's overall approach to chemical safety.  You may want to include any corporate policies (if applicable) and an overview of senior management commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures.\n\nAt Formosa Plastics Corporation, Delaware we are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment to our employees.  In an effort to accomplish this goal the facility has implemented policies and procedures to ensure the safe use of chemicals at the facility.\n\nAll new chemicals introduced into the process and any changes to the operating conditions must go through a Management of Change approval process.  This process requires a review of the potential impact upon the operation of the facility by the Safety Department, Environmental Department, Production Department, Maintenance Department, Technical Department, Technical Service Department, PSM Coordinator and General Manager?s Office. \n\nIn addition to the approval for use through the Management of Change process it is necessary for the Chemical Approval Procedure to be followed if a new chemical is to be purchased or if a change is to occur in the existing storage arrangements of a chemical. The chemical approval review is conducted by the Safety Department and the Environmental Department to ensure the safety of employees and the community as it pertains to the storage and handling of chemicals.\n\nOnce approval to purchase and use a chemical has been obtained the Department in which the chemical is to be used is responsible for providing the necessary training on the safe use and handling of the chemical.  Information that is covered during this training includes; Hazard Communication information, PPE requirements, the details of the SOP for handling the chemical.\n\nAs a final step to ensuring the safety to our employees and to the surrounding community, routine compliance "

These audits are designed to ensure that the procedures are effective at controlling potential hazards and ensuring that the procedures are being properly followed.\n\n In the event that an emergency condition were to develop the site shift supervisor would act as the incident commander until he would be relived by the local fire chief.  At this point the fire chief would serve as the incident commander with extensive consultation being made with the site shift supervisor.  Through this team effort the emergency would be controlled quickly and safely.\n\nB. Your facility and the regulated substances handled \n\nProvide a description of your facility so that the public has a clear picture of the facility, its processes, and products.  Describe the primary activities at the facility (e.g., manufacturer of polyethylene, pulp mill, etc.) and the regulated substances used.  In addition, you may want to mention the quantities of these substances handled or stored at your facility.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe first sections of the Delaware City PVC plant were built in 1966 by Stauffer Chemical Co. The facility was acquired in 1981 by the Formosa Plastics Group.  The current plant property line covers 112 acres of which approximately 30 acres is leased as farmland.  The site employs 98 full-time employees.  The major components of the facility involve two PVC Polymerization units, two dryer units, an automatic bagging plant, waste water treatment plant, and the finished goods warehouse.  The plant production capability is 180 tons of PVC Resin per day. \n\nPRIMARY ACTIVITIES:\n\nThe primary activities carried out at the facility involve polymerization of Vinyl Chloride and Vinyl Chloride / Vinyl Acetate Copolymers, drying of PolyVinyl Chloride, Packaging of PolyVinyl Chloride, Storage and Shipping of PolyVinyl Chloride, and treatment of process waste water.\n\nREGULATED SUBS"

      "SummaryText": "TANCES:\n\nVinyl Chloride\nVinyl Acetate \n\nPRODUCTION PROCESS:\n\nThe facility production process involves converting Vinyl Chloride to PolyVinyl Chloride Dispersion Resins and Specialty Resins.  In order to produce PolyVinyl Chloride, Vinyl Chloride is received from rail car and unloaded into storage tanks.  From the storage tanks the Vinyl Chloride is then transferred into reactors.  Then under controlled temperature and pressure conditions in a water medium, the Vinyl Chloride molecules are linked together to form long chains.  These long chains are called polymerized vinyl chloride or PolyVinyl Chloride.\n\n In order to produce Specialty Resins, an additional raw material, vinyl acetate is used at the facility.  The use of this raw material allows the production of co-polymers with vinyl chloride.  These products provide improved fusion rate properties which allow users to process the resin at lower operating temperatures.  Typical applications are flooring, laminating, adhesives, automotive sealants and various coatings.\n\nAfter the PolyVinyl Chloride is created it is then dried through a natural gas fired dryer.  The dried material is then deagglomerated and transferred into storage silos.  From the storage silos the final product is packaged into 50 pound bags and 2000 pound supersacks. The final product is stored in our finished goods warehouse from where it is transported via tractor trailer throughout the U.S and Canada.\n\nAs part of the reaction process a large volume of water is required.  All remaining water is treated through the facility?s waste water treatment plant prior to final discharge through the plant outfall to the Delaware River.\n\nFinal products produced at the Delaware City plant are used for medical examination gloves, adhesives, carpet backing, floor covering, automotive sealants and upholstery, bottle cap seals, traffic safety cones, automotive air filter gaskets and many other useful finished products.\n\n\nC.

You should also highlight practices that you believe are important to your prevention program.  The steps you list may be either technological (e.g., backup systems) or procedural/managerial (e.g., improved maintenance or training).\n\nOSHA PSM\n\nDue to the fact that the facility uses, stores, and handles Vinyl Chloride and Vinyl Acetate, and the fact that the quantities are greater than 10,000 pounds, the facility must comply with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  This regulation requires that several conditions must be met such as; ensuring that Hot Work Permits are issued for welding and cutting operations, conducting routine compliance audits to ensure compliance, mechanical integrity to ensure the equipment is properly maintained and conducting process hazard analyses.  Each of these requirements ensure that employees are provided with a safe working environment and in turn ensure that the community are adequately protected.\n\nNESHAP\n Vinyl Chloride is a regulated substance under the EPA NESHAP Standard.  The regulations requires extensive monitoring of all valves and flanges to ensure that leaks of Vinyl Chloride are not occurring. The end result of this program is the ability to quickly respond to potential leaks at concentrations that are well below levels that would either impact our employees health and safety or the health and safety of the community. \n\nAmbient Air Monitoring Program (ARCAS)\n\nIn an effort to respond quickly to potential hazardous conditions an ambient air monitoring system and associated program has been implemented.  This program enables employees to monitor the atmosphere of critical process areas on a 24 hour basis.  The program is comprised of 4 gas chromatographs, each with the capability to collect atmospheric samples from 20 monitoring points.  The "

This allows employees to be informed quickly so that immediate action can be taken to locate and stop possible leaks. \n\n5 - 50 and >50 PPM Emission Investigation Program\n\nThe 5 - 50 ppm and >50 ppm emission investigation programs were voluntarily instituted to pro-actively determine the date, time, cause, equipment, shift, location and probable cause of potential VCM emissions.  When the ARCAS emissions monitors detect a concentration of VCM in the facility greater than or equal to 5 ppm, the area operators contact their supervisor immediately and investigate the source of the VCM.  Once the source is identified the necessary corrective actions are immediately implemented.  Once the situation has been corrected, a more thorough investigation, depending on concentration, is conducted to determine the root cause of the incident and to implement preventive measures to prevent recurrence of the situation. Corrective actions, that are the result of a > 50ppm emission, are tracked through the site?s ISO non-conformance process to ensure timely completion and a determination of the effectiveness of the action to prevent future leaks.\n\nEarly Relief Vent\n\nThe early relief venting system is designed to relieve Vinyl Chloride from vessels at a pressure below the pressure relief valve (PRV) rating.  This system prevents the release of Vinyl Chloride gas to the atmosphere by utilizing containment vessels, vacuum pumps and compressors.  The ERV system is used routinely as a Vinyl Chloride recovery system and is a reliable, ready and Operator-familiar containment system.\n\nISO 9002 and ISO 14001\n\nIn 1994 the facility achieved ISO 9002 Registration and in 1996 the facility achieved ISO 14001 Registration.
