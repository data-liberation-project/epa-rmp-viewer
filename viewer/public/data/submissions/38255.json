      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the Jefferson County ESD?s policy to operate safe wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the necessary treatment processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Five Mile Creek WWTP.  It is ESD?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws applicable to the Five Mile Creek WWTP.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Five Mile Creek WWTP is a publicly owned and operated wastewater treatment plant.  Chlorine is used primarily for disinfection.  Other possible uses of chlorine are for odor control and to assist in settling biosolids in the clarification process.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the facility is 8,000 pounds (4 one-ton containers).  The chlorination system consists of vacuum regulators, evaporator, automatic switchover system, chlorine gas dispensers, chlorine leak detectors, alarms, associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorinating the effluent before it is discharged into Five Mile Creek.  However, the sulfur dioxide storage quantity is less than the Risk Management Program (RMP) applicability threshold of 5,000 pounds.  Engineered controls including vacuum regulators, sulfur dioxide leak detectors, alarms, and associated piping are present on the sulfur dioxide system to minimize the risk of an accidental release.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Five Mile Creek WWTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well a"

A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a ?What-If? analysis.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nIn the past five years, the Five Mile Creek WWTP has not had a release of chlorine resulting in injuries, deaths, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  Also, there were no accidents involving chlorine in the 5-year period prior to the submittal of the 1999 RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Jefferson County ESD has an emergency response plan for the Five Mile Creek WWTP, which coordinates response efforts with the Fultondale Fire Department, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the Five Mile Creek WWTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system."
