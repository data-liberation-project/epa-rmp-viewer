The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\r\n \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.

It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC, (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal located in Apache County, Arizona is owned by Enterprise Products Operating LLC, and is operated by Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility.  The facility receives propane, butane; pentane and mixed refinery grade butane (RGB) liquids either by rail car or transport truck and stores these liquids in one of ten active underground storage caverns.  These liquids are stored until needed and are then shipped back out of the facility to wholesale customers.  Normal butane is shipped out exclusively by railcar.  The other liquid products stored at Adamana are shipped out either by railcar or transport truck.  A number of surge tanks are on site at the facility to receive products prior to subsequent pumping into the storage caverns.  A solid bed propane dehydrator is used to provide dehydration for stored propane product prior to truck or railcar loading.  An iso-butane / normal butane splitter unit is also available for on-site fractionation of refinery grade butane (RGB) products on a batch basis.  The fractionation facility is currently isolated and shut down."

      "SummaryText": "Should facility economics favor restart of the fractionator, any restart of the unit will be accomplished within the requirements of the Adamana management of change program.  .\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on the known volumes of the storage caverns and rail car loading and unloading rack.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Adamana Storage and Terminal facility are propane, normal butane, pentane and the mixed refinery grade butane.  The Storage and Terminal facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program being put in place at the Adamana Storage and Terminal.  The storage and loading operations at the Storage and Terminal facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system being put into place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Storage and Terminal facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastr"
