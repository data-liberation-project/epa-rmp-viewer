      "SummaryText": "The ConAgra Foods Packaged Foods, LLC (CFPF) facility in Russellville, AR has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The CFPF facility has thorough emergency training program on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented CFPF's HAZWOPER Plan (Emergency Response Program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees', the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, CFPF emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, CFPF has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  These components make the CFPF HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the CFPF facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There is also provision for coordination with outside agencies such as the Russellville Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  For the plan update dated July 11, 2008 the equipment details, equipment locations, and ammonia quantities in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) contained in the Supporting Information were not updated since the net change in the potential worst-case release quantity did not exceed the guidelines provided in Section 4.1 of the US EPA General Risk Management Program Guidance document. * From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia."
