Processing operations at this facility also include ingredient cherry processing, fresh cherry packing, ingredient cherry packing, infused fruit processing, fruit drying, and finished product packaging.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to optimize uses for the growers' fruit and preserve cherry quality. Our mission is to produce the highest quality cherry products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\n\nTo assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Cascade Fruit Company has a long standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process team members assist in the annual update of our procedures and safety information.  We have had no accidental releases of Sulfur Dioxide in the last five years.\n\nOur hazard analysis shows our worst case scenario is loss of all contents of a 90 ton railcar of Sulfur Dioxide in 10 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is 25 miles.  Potential population affected is 23,000 people.   The Most Likely(alternate) scenario is a leak in a 5 ton cylinder valve where the quantity released is 300 pounds over 60 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is 1.7 miles.  Potential population affected is 18 people.\n \nTo assure accidental releases are prevented, Cascade Fruit Company has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide.  All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained qualified employees.  These include written o"

Emergency Response activities are reviewed and updated annually.  Emergency response training is included in pre-harvest training activities.\n\nPlanned improvements include additional coordinated training with local emergency response agencies and applying the principles of continuous improvement to all chemical handling processes.  All improvements are documented and reviewed with the process team prior to implementation."
