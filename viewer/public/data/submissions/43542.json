Main and 405 N. Jefferson has been in operation in the city of Springfield and area since 1979. We are a manufacture of poultry and poultry products. We currently employ over 700 people at our Main Street Operations and over 350 people at our Jefferson Street Operations. Our product is shipped all across the United States and to several countries outside the U.S.\n\nThe 501 N. Main street plant was purchased by James T. Hudson in 1979 and has been producing retail ready and whole sale Turkey products since then. The company since 1979 has operated under the name of Hudson Foods Inc. and briefly Tyson Foods Inc. The company is currently doing business as Willow Brook Foods Inc. with ownership locally as well as joints ownership out of San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThe personal safety and health of each employee of this company is of primary importance. The prevention of occupationally induced injuries and illnesses is of such consequence that it will be given precedence over operating productivity whenever necessary.\n\nWe continually strive to be a member of the community in good standing. We are long time active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (L.E.P.C.) as well as members of The Safety Council of The Ozarks.\n\nWe provide the required \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\" scenarios for the Main Street Operations as follows: \n\n(These scenarios were created using RMP COMP (tm) provided by the E.P.A.)\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nA.) Accidental release of ammonia (NH3)\n\nB.) The physical state of this release was gas liquefied by refrigeration.\n\nC.) The quantity released was 23,000 pounds, which purged the holding tank.\n\nD.) The rate of release was 2,300 pounds per minute.\n\nE.) The release duration was 10 minutes.\n\nF.) The wind speed was 1.5 miles per hour.\n\nG.) Our atmospheric stability class F.\n\nH.) O"

We also follow O.S.H.A. as well as the I.I.A.R. guidelines closely. We have several safe guards in place to monitor the pressure in our ammonia system and automatically react in the case of a problem.\n\nWe have both Refrigeration and Maintenance employees on duty on site 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. We also have a 50 person Haz-Mat Team (Hazardous Material Handling Team), with full Haz-Mat equipment at both of our operations.\n\nWithin the last 5 years we have had no accidental releases at the Main Street Operation.\n\nAs stated we have a 50 person Haz-Mat Team with Haz-Mat equipment. We have on going training classes with our Haz-Mat Team to include 24 hours year hands on and class room training. We also work closely with both the Springfield Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. We welcome the opportunity to participate in the Risk Management Program.
