The monitors are set to alarm at 10 % of the lower explosive limit (LEL). If any two alarms\r\nreach 20% of the LEL at the same time, it will completely shut down the entire plant. Our system will also not\r\nallow an override of this safety feature requiring the problem to be fixed immediately or the system will not\r\nstart back up.\r\n\r\nD. The five year accident history;\r\n We had one accidental release of acetylene in the past five years.  The release was approximately 72500 pounds of acetylene that burned during the fire and therefore not released offsite.  There were no offsite injuries or off site property damage.  Houses in the area were evacuated by local fire response as a precautionary measure during the event.  There was no offsite environmental impact.  All fill line pigtail flash arrestor and pigtail check valves were replaced.\r\n\r\nE. The emergency response program:\r\nCoordination of Emergency Response for this facility consists of tours taken by the Bellville Fire Department\r\nand Local EMS system. Western's Safety and Compliance Director is actively involved in the local LEPC.\r\nWestern invites the local Fire Department to our facility as part of their training program to familiarize them\r\nwith our facility and products. These tours and training received count as required hours the Fire Department members to remain certified.  \r\nWe have added dry hydrants to our onsite pond to allow  the local Fire Department to hook up and get water if needed for our plant in an event of a fire.  We have also allowed them access to these dry hydrants for use for our neighbors in the Austin County Area by the local Fire Department.  The pond is backed up by a water well if needed for additional water.\r\n\r\nAll Western personnel also receive training on emergency response. Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually or whenever a change in process would occur. Monthly"
