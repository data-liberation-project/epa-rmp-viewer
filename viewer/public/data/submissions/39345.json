      "SummaryText": "The City of Quincy, Illinois (Quincy) operates a Water Filtration Plant (WTP) that utilizes chlorine (covered process). Since 2,500# of chlorine is stored at our facility, we are subject to the requirements codified under the US EPA CAA 112r Risk Management Provisions (112r).\n\nThe plan consists of the following components and directives:\n\nManagement Plan ? The Director of Utilities is responsible for meeting the required directives of 112r. \n\nFacility Emergency Response Plan ? The WTP utilizes our Chemical Release Prevention Program (CRPP) to coordinate mitigation efforts which would be utilized in the event of a release from our covered processes. Elemental directives of our CRPP include employee training, incident investigations and corrective action implementation, and employee hazard reviews.\n\nSeveral potential releases were utilized to generate a worst-case scenario release and an alternative (most likely scenario) release scenario.  EPA guidance documentation was utilized to determine all receptors within toxic endpoints of a chemical release from a covered process emanating from our WWTP. \n\nChlorine\n\nA Worst Case release could potentially affect a radius of 1.3 miles in our urban environment. An estimated population within that radius was estimated to be 5,380.\n\nAn Alternative Case (most likely scenario) could potentially affect a radius of .45 miles. An estimated population within that radius was estimated to be 193.\n\nIn the past five years the WWTP has had no releases associated with a covered process."
