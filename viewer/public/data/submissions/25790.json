This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  The Perryville Energy Partners L.L.C. policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nPerryville Energy Partners, L.L.C. operates the PPS located in Ouachita Parish, Louisiana.  The PPS is a gas fired steam electric plant that produces approximately 725 megawatts of electricity.  The heat recovery steam generators used to turn electric generating units producing electricity for sale to homes and businesses.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accident Release Program (ARP), the PPS is a Program 3 process.\n\nThe PPS was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were or would be present in the planned process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  There is one ammonia tank at the facility.  The identification of a vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nPerryville Energy Partners, L.L.C. identified one regulated toxic substance and no flammable substances above the threshold values at PPS.  The anhydrous ammonia tank with a capacity of 5,000 gallons was determined to exceed the threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that the PPS is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nOff Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as ?The release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or"

WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C.  Topography for WCSs is distinguished between rural and urban.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nPerryville Energy Partners L.L.C. did not find any flammable substances above threshold quantities at EPS.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nPerryville Energy Partners, LLC identified anhydrous ammonia, a toxic gas, as being present in quantities in excess of threshold quantities.  Toxic gasses include all regulated toxic substances that are gasses at ambient temperature, even if they are stored as liquids under pressure of refrigeration.  For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in ten minutes, regardless of storage conditions.  For toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released for the pipeline is assumed to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids.  The endpoint for air dispersion modeling to estimate the consequence distance for a release of a toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid in Appendix B of the OCAGD in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, used as an integral component of the nitrogen oxides emissions control system, is stored in one 5,000 gallon pressurized storage tank at PPS.

Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this release represents the facility?s worst-case scenario for toxic gas and liquids.  Using administrative controls, only 21,195 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was determined to be 2.6 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nAn ARS describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those cited for a WCS.  One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a Program 2 or 3 process that exceeds threshold quantity while only one ARS analysis is required for all flammable substances as a class.  For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fence line.  Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\n\nPPS Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammables\n\nNo flammable substances were found at PPS in quantities above threshold values.\n\nPPS Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Toxics\n\nA single ARS for the anhydrous ammonia is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario was identified for the anhydrous ammonia Tank.  Seal failure on the anhydrous ammonia tank causes a release from a one-inch opening at a pressure of 145 psia and a temperature of 77 degrees F.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.

This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based o their knowledge, skill job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained by the company.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe PPS maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as for key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe PPS has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe PPS uses a combination of what if/checklist and a hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  These methods use a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The PPS assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.  The plant also provides proof of communication with operation, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the PPS has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operations demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe PPS issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  Procedures for issuing a hot work permit are clearly outlined in the Cleco Safety Manual.  The PPS provides Hot Work Permit training to all plant employees.  Copies of issued work permits are maintained in operations and Maintenance for a period of one-year following completion of work.\n\nContractors\n\nThe PPS periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, outage, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operation, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed.  A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe PPS has well-established programs, procedures and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store or handle lightly hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release.  Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) the procedures applicable to the employee?s job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.
