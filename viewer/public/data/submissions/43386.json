      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City of Pulaski operates and maintains a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) capable of treating an average of four million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater.  The WWTP currently uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant in the treatment process and utilizes ton chlorine cylinders manifolded in pairs with a backup pair to provide the supply chlorine.  Additionally, the plant stores up to two reserve non-connected cylinders to replace chlorine cylinders in service as they are depleted.  No more than 12,000 pounds of chlorine is on the site at any time.\n\nThe City of Pulaski Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed this Risk Management Program in an attempt to identify all possible chemical emergencies which may occur and the best way to prevent the accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere from the plant\u00bfs chlorination facilities.  The City Personnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination equipment conduct their work with the upmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the dangers involved with chlorine.  The City places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters.  \n\nThe City\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) plan has been coordinated with the Giles County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the City of Pulaski Safety Board to assure that all entities are aware of the possible dangers involved in a chlorine leak from the Water Treatment Plant.  The City has developed a written operations manual, Emergency Response Plan and emergency action plan as a part of the OSHA PSM plan. As a part of the written operations manual, City personnel proceed with work at a safe pace and double check all connections when changing tanks or adjusting the system.  Additional safety measures are installed in the form of ventilators and chlorine leak detectors which assist in the notification and protection of emergency personnel in the event of a leak.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan outlines the proper procedures to follow in"

City personnel always conduct their work with the chlorine equipment at a safe pace and double check all connections when changing  tanks or adjusting the system.  The plant chief operator conducts competency tests through physical observation of the work being conducted.

This pipe is inspected each time a new cylinder is connected, and replaced if defects are found.  As preventive maintenance, the pipes are replaced every six months even if no defects are seen on the pipe.

      "SummaryText": "the event of a chlorine leak detection.  Upon detection of the leak, the plant supervisor will notify the emergency service coordinator as defined in the City of Pulaski\u00bfs Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate assistance with outside emergency units.  The cause of the leak will then be determined so that appropriate actions may be taken to insure public safety.  The City of Pulaski Fire Department will act as standby rescue personnel for the plant operators while an attempt to stop the chlorine leak is made.  The fire department personnel will be familiarized with the chlorine system so as to assure that, if necessary, they may be able to isolate the leak and stop it.  The Emergency Service Coordinator will work with the Pulaski Police Department and other personnel to alert nearby residents to remove to safety if the need arises.  Local radio stations may also be utilized to notify the public of the emergency condition and what to do.To date, the City of Pulaski has had no major accidental releases of chlorine which required action involving off-site receptors.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the Risk Management Plan was evaluated as a rupture of a full ton chlorine cylinder and release of its contents to the atmosphere.  The most probable alternative release scenario has been determined to be a cracked and leaking supply line.  The EPA supplied RMPCOMP program was used to evaluate the area of effect for these releases. Using this program, it has been determined that both scenarios will have some offsite impact.  The worst case scenario has an area of effect of 0.9 miles in radius and the alternate scenario has an area of 0.1 miles in raduis.  The worst case scenario could possibly affect approximately 3,700 people and public receptors involved include schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, churches, and residences depending on the wind direction.  The alternate scenario could possibly"

      "SummaryText": ".  Typically no more than 12,000 pounds of chlorine are on the site at any time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The city personnel responsible for the daily maintenance and operation of the chlorination equipment conduct their work with the upmost professionalism and have a deep respect of the dangers involved with chlorine.  The city places chlorine safety ahead of all other matters.  The city has developed a written operations manual, emergency response plan, and emergency action plan; and, conducted a process hazard analysis as a part of the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan(PSM).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The process hazard analysis determined that the major hazards identified were a toxic release of chlorine either from a cylinder rupture or pipe leak and failure of equipment to control the chloine flow or detect a chlorine leak.  The major natural hazard would occur from a tornado touchdown on the plant's facilities.  These hazards are mitigated through process controls in the form of vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, excess flow devices, iterlocks, and alarm systems along with passive enclosure of the facilities, regular maintenance of the equipment, and proper training of the personnel using the equipment."
