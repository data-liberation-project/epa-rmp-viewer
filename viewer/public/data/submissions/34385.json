CoorsTek takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the ammonia process and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  CoorsTek has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on an annual basis and revised as needed.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nBuilding 19 manufactures ceramic electronic components.  The RMP regulated substance at this facility is ammonia (NH3).  The ammonia is used as feedstock for the ammonia disassociation process at the Nitroneal Generator and the Sargent & Wilbur Disassociator.  The ammonia is stored in a 16,000 gallon tank with a maximum inventory of 65,000 pounds.\n\nPrevention Steps for Ammonia\nThe prevention program and chemical safety issues are described in detail in the facility PSM/RMP Manual.  This facility is covered under the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and that allows us to employ technical and management systems approaches to ensuring safety of the ammonia system.  The following elements are included in the manual:\n\n- Employee Participation:  includes provisions for employees to be involved in development and implementation of the RMP program.\n- Process Safety Information: includes technical information on the process and components.\n- Process Hazard Analysis: this section outlines the company's approach to PHA's for the ammonia system.\n- Operating Procedures: this section describes the nature and general content of the operating procedures"

Drills are held as required by our procedures and regulations, and the plan is updated accordingly.  \n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nEmployees are encouraged to provide suggestions for improvement on an ongoing basis.  New employees are informed of the RMP program, ERP plans and alarms, to recognize hazards and to present ideas for safety improvement.  There are no signficant changes planned for this operation.\n\nEmployees were involved in the initial and revalidation Process Hazard Analyses.
