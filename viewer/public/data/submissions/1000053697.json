The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and foremost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the surrounding communities.  It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology Manager and a Supply and Logistics Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.  AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country.  Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.   \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to retail and wholesale customers.  Propane is received via railcar or transport truck and distributed to customers via transport truck. The facility is equipped to unload railcars and load or unload transport trucks as needed.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\n\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Polici"

Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices.  The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via inspection and painting programs.  \n\n\n\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems are also installed on site.  Shutdown systems include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment and isolate a problem once detected.  Portable fire extinguishers are also available on site for employee use. \n\n\n\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals.  In addition, the site complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  \n\n\n\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained in the terminalA?s loading and Emergency Action Plan procedures and many have also been trained using the National Propane Gas AssociationA?s (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility is considered a non-responding location with no toxic substances on-site and as such maintains an Emergency Action Plan ("

Notification of any potentially affected neighbors would be done via local emergency response organizations following consultation with site personnel.  Should an actual incident occur the EAP gives our employees guidance for when and how to respond to minor incidents, spills and fires on-site.  Larger emergencies require assistance from local emergency response organizations and site personnel are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.  \n\n\n\nThe EAP is reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise.  The EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\n\n\n\n1) NPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks:  Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How To Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\n\n2) OSHAA?s Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, A?Emergency Action PlansA?, 29CFR 1910.39, A?Fire Prevention PlansA?, 29 CFR 1910.119, A?Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous ChemicalsA? and 29 CFR 1910.120, A?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency ResponseA?\n\n3) National Fire Protection Association Guidelines, NFPA 58, A?Liquified Petroleum Gas CodeA? and NFPA 54, A?National Fuel Gas CodeA?.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNo changes are planned for the facility in the near future."
