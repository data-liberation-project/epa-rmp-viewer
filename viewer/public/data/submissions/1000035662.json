Facility Policy.\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Farmers Cooperative Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Johnson, County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.     Facility Information.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of fertilizer products.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\nConsistent with the compliance guidelines of 29 CFR Part 1910 and 40 CFR Part 68, this facility has developed a management system to minimize consequences associated with manufacturing anhydrous ammonia-based fertilizers.\n\n\n\nFarmers Cooperative Company has its Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and developed emergency action plans.  This program provides plans and information that will assist emergency responders in the event of an accident at the facility.\n\n\n\nFinally, the management system provides procedures and plans to assist employees in conducting both routine and non-routine plant operations, to identify potential hazardous situations. \n\n\n\n3.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nThe facility personnel are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by continually improving polici"

In the unlikely event of a release, we have an emergency action plan in place to minimize potential effects.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\n\n\n\nFarmers Cooperative Company facility has one regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in horizontal bullet-tanks.  The facility has two (2) processes for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe first process is the storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for farmin operations in the area.  \n\n\n\nThe second process is converting anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid (68%, CAS No. 7664-38-2).  This process uses TVA Pipe Reactor technology to neutralize the phosphoric acid with ammonia.  The resultant liquid product is an ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer, NPK: 10-34-0.   This product is only marketed to retailers.  This process is conducted by Mears Fertilizer Inc. with their equipment and their employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.     The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\n    The worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  In this scenario, ammonia would be released to atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The gaseous ammonia is released at Class F stability with 1.5 m/s wind-speed.  \n\n\n\n    The alternative-case scenario involves the release of 2,900 lbs. of ammonia over a 2-minute period.  Ammonia is assumed to be released in gaseous form.  The release is assumed to be controlled by excess flow valves, emergency shutdown and/or emergency response procedures.  Weather conditions are assumed to be neutral.\n\n\n\n The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\n\n\nThis facility has taken steps to comply with accidental release prevention.  The following elements are in place at the facility and compris"

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last 5-years that have:  caused deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, \n\n                   the required response action is to offer assistance to 911 responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFarmers Cooperative Company has continual personnel training to reduce the potential for accidental chemical releases.  This is accomplished by periodic evaluations, inspections, testing, and upgrading serves to prevent releases from equipment failures.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.\n\n"
