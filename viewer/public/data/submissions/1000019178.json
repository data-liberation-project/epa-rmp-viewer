      "SummaryText": "Shawnee Milling Company operates rural feed stores offering anhydrous ammonia to local farmers.  Onsite storage and dispensing of this toxic chemical varies in quantities based on seasonal application demand.  For approximately 3-4 months of the year, maximum quantities of anhydrous ammonia are reduced to less than 20% (48,600 pounds) of the maximum quantity of 257,040 pounds held in storage.\n\nThe company ensures that tanks and components are regularly maintained by trained employees and/or qualified contractors.  This facility is regularly inspected by employees, it's insurance carrier and the State of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.  This facility could have as much as 257,040 pounds of anhydrous ammonia onsite at its peak sales period, as administrative operating procedures limit storage capacity of the tanks to 85%.\n\nStorage tank(s) and system components are replaced on a regular basis by qualified staff or contractors.\n\nThe worst case scenario is structural damage to one of the two bulk storage tanks containing, at peak periods, up to 128,520 pounds of NH3.  Failure would result in a near-full release of ammonia within 10 minutes in a rural environment.  The toxic endpoint has been calculated to be 6.9 miles from the tank at which point it would be dispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Public receptors include residences.  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe more probable alternative accidental release would involve a ruptured disk or relief valve failure that could potentially result in up to 200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia being released before an emergency shutoff valve was activated.  The toxic endpoint would be limited to 0.3 miles whilch would expose very few residences and no other commercial, public or environmental receptors.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the past five years.\n\nThis facility follows the emergency response plan established by the Canadian"
