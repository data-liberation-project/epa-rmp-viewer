Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, US Foods, Inc. will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality to respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nUS Foods, Inc. is a foodservice distributor located in Phoenix, Arizona.
