Inc, a division of Sundance Resources of Phoenix, Ariz. began production\nat the Burley facility in August of 1996.  We produce the pesticide, Metam Sodium under the\ntrade name of Sectagon 42.  The raw materials used in the process are water, Monomethylamine,\nCarbon Disulfide, and Sodium Hydroxide.    \n     The water is pumped from the ground, treated to make it suitable for the process, and\nadded as needed.\n     The Carbon Disulfide and Monomethylamine arrive at the site by rail car, while the\nSodium Hydroxide may arrive by either rail car to tanker truck.\n     The finished product is shipped from the plant by either tanker truck or railcar.\n\n     The plant is divided into three separate areas.  To the east is the receiving and storage\narea for the raw materials.  Here the material is received in rail cars, or tanker trucks carrying the\nSodium Hydroxide.   The cars are spotted at the appropriate tower for the unloading.  We use\ntwo towers, one for Carbon disulfide, and one for the amine and Sodium Hydroxide.   This\nseparation of unloading towers allow us to fit each tower with fittings and equipment specific to\neach type of chemical.  This prevents any possible mixing of chemicals in the storage tanks.\n     Upon arrival, the tank cars are spotted at the proper tower for unloading.   Grounding\nstraps are attached and checked to prevent any sparking from static electricity while unloading is\noccurring.   The system is also configured such that the transfer pumps will not start unless the\ngrounding is complete.  The fittings are attached to the cars, and tested for tightness.  All tools\nused in the opening and closing are spark-less, thus again preventing accidental ignition of any\nflammable vapors.  The system is pressure checked with an inert gas, nitrogen, and the cars\npressurized with the same gas.  This again prevents any accidental i"

We have the capability of storing over 328,000\ngallons of Carbon Disulfide at any one time. .  Similarly,  we have the capacity for 65,000\ngallons of the amine, but there is rarely this much on hand at any one time.  \n      There is never any cross mixing of storage chemicals.  All tanks are grounded, held\nunder an inert gas atmosphere, and monitored.  The thickness of the metal is checked on an\nannual basis with a non-destructive technique to verify that the chemicals are not corroding the\nwalls, leading to a hazardous situation.  All tanks are equipped with pressure relief devices and\nrupture disks set to release before a pressure increase would rupture the tank.  These devices are\nchecked on a routine basis.\n\n     A computer modeling program was used to assess the possible damage to the area and\nthe environment from an accidental release of the stored chemicals.  There were two scenarios\nran for both Carbon Disulfide and Monomethylamine: A 'worst case' scenario, and a secondary,\nmore realistic one.  \n     The \"Worst Case\" scenario for Carbon Disulfide was the total failure of a storage tank,\nreleasing the entire amount of 54,000 gallons into the containment berm.   For this scenario, it\nwas assumed that the entire spill occurred within ten minutes, the air temperature was the\nhighest recorded in the area for the last five years (100 F), and the wind was blowing at 3 yards\nper second.  Under this scenario, the area of concern stretched for 11 miles.  This would include\nthe entire town of Burley, provided the wind direction was correct.   A secondary scenario was\nran using the same conditions, only using the actual conditions that would occur under our\ncontrol and response plans.  Under this scenario, the area of concern was only 0.6 miles. \nAnother scenario was ran, using the conditions of a small leak from a broken pipe givi"

      "SummaryText": "ng a hole\nof less then two square inches.  This gave an area of concern of only 0.2 miles.\n     A similar computer scenario was ran for the amine.  The main difference between the\ntwo was that the Carbon Disulfide is considered a toxic liquid, while the amine is considered to\nyield an explosive cloud that ignites.  Under the \"Worst Case\" scenario, the release of an entire\ntank of 32,000 gallons, with the resultant explosion, the area of influence of the explosion, or the\narea of damage was 0.2 miles.   Similarly, the scenario of a leaking pipe, with the resultant fire\nball gave an area of damage of 0.1 miles.\n     To mitigate these types of damages, the storage areas are equipped with a number of\nsafety devices to monitor and prevent any release of the chemical.    The storage tanks are\nenclosed in concrete berms that would contain any spill from the tank in a small area, thus\nlimiting the surface area of the liquid, and thus slowing down the amount released.  In addition,\nboth storage areas have the capability of being showered with copious amounts of water to\nknock down, and contain vapors that may be released.  \n     The storage area for the Carbon Disulfide has one additional safety feature.   Since the\nchemical is heavier then water, the containment berm has had installed a deluge system and\nmonitoring detectors.  If the detectors sense the chemical above a set amount well below any\ndanger level, but signaling a possible leak, they set off an alarm in the central computer system. \nThis alarm opens the deluge system flooding the containment area to a depth of over ten inches\nof water in less then ten minutes.  The Carbon Disulfide will be submerged by the water, totally\nlimiting the amount of vapors that are released from the site.   \n     The raw materials are brought into the central processing area under redundant computer\ncontrol and inert gas blanket where they are combined to produce the product.

From the\ncentral control room, the entire plant may be shut down to a safe condition in just seconds. \n     Following processing, which includes an added step to remove any unreacted raw\nmaterials, the product goes into storage, where it awaits shipment.\n\n\n     Sundance Ag., both employees and management, place a great deal of emphasis on both\nsafety and environmental protection. We feel that these go hand in hand.   All operators at the\nsite are given extensive training in response to both chemical spills and safety hazards.  All\noperators are trained to a Hazmat Technician level by schooling certified by the State of Idaho\nBureau of Emergency Response.  In addition, all are trained in CPR and First Aid.  We hold\nnumerous training sessions, dry runs, and full response exercises to keep these skills up to date. \nWe have, on site, many pieces of emergency response equipment.  Until just recently, we were\nthe best trained and equipped hazardous materials response personnel in the entire Mini-Cassia\narea.  We train  in connection with both the local fire department, sheriff's office, hospital, and\nlocal emergency planning committee.  This assures that all people who may have to respond to\nan incident at the site are well acquainted and able to function as a team.  This assures both\nSundance Ag., and our neighbors in Cassia county the highest degree of protection in the event\nof a hazardous chemical incident.\n\n     In April of 1997, shortly after we began production, we experienced an incident.  A\nstorage tank of product, which inadvertently contained a flammable combination of chemicals,\nsomehow ignited.  The result was the injury of one employee who was responding to the\nemergency. This employee later died in the hospital.   There was about 12,000 gallons of product\nreleased to the environment.  Emergency responders were called, and respon"

Thanks to the\nwork that had been done in safety training, the results were kept to a minimum, with no\nhazardous chemicals escaping the site.\n     Since that time, the entire plant and process has been re-designed and re-built.  The\ncomputer control system has been installed.  The process has been altered, by additional\nequipment and processing steps, to assure that the final product going into storage is as safe as\npossible.  This has resulted in, not only better product, but less waste that has to be disposed of\nby transporting to waste treatment facilities.  An effect that helps everyone.\n     We also took the accident as a wake up call to beef up the training and the response\nability.  We added paperwork and training pursuant to OSHA's   Process Safety Management\nprogram.  We established response documents, detailing to operators specific steps to be taken\nin the event of a release or hazardous materials incident.  These are taught, tested, and trained on\nconstantly.  We currently are in the process of making application to OSHA to be accepted into\ntheir Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).

It has a pungent fishy odor that may resemble ammonia at higher concentrations. It is\n  used for making pharmaceuticals~ insecticides, paint removers, surfactants, rubber chemicals,\n  and various other products. It is irritating and corrosive to bodily tissue. The gas is heavier\n  than air and may collect in low-lying areas. It is easily ignited under most ambient temperature\n  conditions. Its boiling point of 20.3 deg. F. indicates that Methylamine will boil or otherwise\n  evaporate rapidly upon release. It is very soluble in water and does not react. Vapor of the\n  product are heavier than air, may travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and\n  flash back. Vapors may persist in pits, hollows, and depressions. Accumulation of vapor or gas\n  in confined spaces such as buildings or sewers, may explode if ignited. Containers may\n  rupture violently if exposed to fire or excessive heat for sufficient time. The product weighs\n  approximately 5.8 lbs/gallon. ((C) AAR, 1991)\n \n  Fire Hazard\n  FLAMMABLE. POISONOUS GASES MAY BE PRODUCED IN FIRE. Containers may\n  explode in fire. Flashback along vapor trail may occur. Vapor may explode if ignited in an\n  enclosed area. Toxic nitrogen oxides may be formed. Vapors are heavier than air and may\n  travel considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back. (USCG, 1991)\n \n  Fire Fighting\n  Do not extinguish fire unless flow can be stopped.
