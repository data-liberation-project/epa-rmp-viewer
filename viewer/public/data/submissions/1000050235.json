The G&UR complies with National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements for LP-Gas Storage, and it is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is company policy to notify the Grafton, MA Fire Department which responds to the emergency.  Fire suppression equipment and training has also been provided to the operations personnel at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe G&UR LPG Transfer Facility is a liquefied petroleum gas transfer operation that receives propane by rail car. Propane is stored at the Grafton and Upton Railroad LPG Transfer Facility and distributed by customer truck transports.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release and Alternate Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario modeled/estimated the release of an 80,000 gallon (310,000 pounds) above ground storage tank containing propane for a Vapor Cloud Explosion over a 10 minute period.  The RMP Comp Software estimated the distance to 1 psi overpressure at 0.5 miles (0.9 Kilometers). \n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario modeled/estimated the release of an 80,000 gallon above storage tank containing propane for a Vapor Cloud Explosion over a 60 minute period.  The RMP Comp Software estimated the distance to 1 psi overpressure at 0.3 miles (0.5 Kilometers).\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario modeled/estimated the release of an 80,000 gallon above storage tank containing propane for a Vapor Cloud Fire over a 10 minute period.

The Grafton and Upton Railroad LPG Transfer Facility was designed and will be operated in conformance to the National Fire Protection Association NFPA-58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements and the applicable Massachusetts Fire Prevention regulations as described in 502 CMR 5.00 and 527 CMR 1.0; Chapter 60 regarding hazardous materials processes and Chapter 69 regarding liquefied petroleum gases. \n\n\n\nA water suppression system involving water cannons are being installed at the facility to provide for adequate water suppression in the event of fire and emergency backup power is also being installed at the facility to provide for emergency power in the event of a local power failure. Facility operators and personnel will be adequately training in accordance with the Petroleum Education and Research Council (PERC) and National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP) for operators.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of a regulated substance in the last 5 years.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI):\n\n\n\nThe G&UR has compiled written process safety information for all PSM covered processes. The process safety information includes the hazards of chemicals used in the process, propane information, and process equipment data.

Each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe G&UR LPG Transfer Facility uses the What-if-Checklist PHA methodologies, which are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, engineering expertise and PHA facilitator training. The PHA team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\n\n\nAs a minimum the G&UR LPG Transfer Facility performs periodic PHA reviews or revalidations every 5 years as long as the process is operating.  PHA findings and recommendations and their resolution are documented. The G&UR has implemented a system to address and resolve all PHA findings and recommendations in a timely manner through a written schedule. All PHA findings and recommendation resolutions are communicated to all effected employees. All recommendations must be resolved and documented by management.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (OP):\n\n\n\nThe G&UR has developed and implemented written operating procedures that describe the tasks that LPG transfer facility operators perform, the safe process operating parameters to be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe PERC Plant Operations Manual is utilized as a source reference document for safe operations and work practices at a LPG plant.

The G&UR LPG Transfer Facility written operating procedures describe all the propane safety systems and their functions.  The operating procedures state the operating limits including the consequences of deviation and the steps required to correct or avoid the deviation and are reviewed and certified annually for current practices and accuracy.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:\n\n\n\nThe G&UR has developed and implemented safe work practices in accordance with the OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 requirements that include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, personal protective equipment, fire protection, electrical safety, hot work procedures and permits for work with the potential for generating ignition sources in the presence of flammable or combustible material.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nThe G&UR has developed and implemented formal operator and maintenance training programs. Initial training ensures that new or reassigned personnel are trained in an overview of the process and operating procedures. Refresher training is performed at least every three (3) years to ensure that the operator understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.
