California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Paramount Ventures has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1    PARAMOUNT VENTURES, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Paramount Ventures has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name     Process Chemical    Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nConditioning    Ammonia                     29,500\n\nStorage            Ammonia                      9,600\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and "

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Paramount Ventures business practices\n\n3.    Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Paramount Ventures employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures operates a commercial packing and storage facility for clementines in Delano, CA. The facility has two ammonia systems (Conditioning and Cold Storage).  The Conditioning System provides refrigeration capacity to forty-eight (48) conditioning rooms.  The Cold Storage System provides refrigeration capacity to two (2) cold storage rooms, one (1) precool room, and one (1) loading dock.  The cold storage rooms and loading dock both utilize ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  An HMI control system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n\n\nEach system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator in the engine room.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures was built "

      "SummaryText": "in 2012 by Ross & Sons. No significant changes have occurred since the facility was built.\n\n\n\nThe facility was designed and installed by a licensed contract in accordance with industry standards at the time of construction.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Lastly, each system has an emergency \"dump box\" that contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia systems at Paramount Ventures consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Paramount Ventures facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Ma"

In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Paramount Ventures continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Paramount Ventures' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nParamount Ventures has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Paramount Ventures has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Paramount Ventures now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Paramount Ventures employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Paramount Ventures will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
