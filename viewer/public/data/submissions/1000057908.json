The raw material is subsequently processed in the Splitters separation area, and the resultant product is stored in the Cavern storage area. The purified ethane and propane streams are sold as products. The Facility combines the purified propylene stream with other raw materials, including hydrogen and triethyl aluminum, to produce polypropylene. The polypropylene, in the form of small pellets, is inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous, and not flammable. \r\n\r\nThe facility maintains inventories of propylene, propane, ethane, propyne, and propadiene in quantities exceeding the 10,000 lb threshold for each constituent under the EPA RMP program. The facility does not maintain inventories of any other material in excess of its applicable EPA RMP threshold. The facility's RMP program addresses propylene, propane, ethane, propyne, and propadiene. These materials are flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration. The facility handles these materials under pressure in both gaseous and liquid forms.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe elements of the facility's Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs are distributed among site personnel, coordinated by the Facility Manager and Lead Engineer.

We have developed and implement programs to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment, including those that satisfy Braskem's corporate standards and applicable government requirements.  Braskem's programs satisfy or exceed all applicable requirements under both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP). In order to ensure that our programs remain fully compliant, we periodically re-validate our Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for covered processes to ensure that process hazards remain properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated.  We also utilize these PHA revalidations to identify opportunities for further safety enhancements as needed. Braskem also conducts periodic compliance audits to ensure maintenance of administrative policies and mitigation controls to help prevent accidents and releases. The facility manager retains primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility.  In addition, all employees participate in safety related teams, projects, audits, and other activities and are trained to adhere to established policies and procedures. In addition, the Marcus Hook facility has a dedicated Emergency Response Team, consisting of fully trained members.  An Emergency Response Team is available during each shift.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Braskem Marcus Hook facility manufactures polypropylene, used in many common household items and packaging containers.

As the contract truck driver returned to the cab to shut down the transfer to stop the leak, the Acme fitting loosened further and released approximately 1150 pounds of the propylene/propane mix. The release was ignited by another truck at Rack 15, located next to Rack 16. As a result of the flash fire, the driver for the truck at Rack 15 suffered second degree burns to the face and hands. Another driver who was unloading a truck nearby received burns to the face. Both truck drivers were taken to the Crozer Medical Center for treatment. Braskem personnel extinguished the fire after approximately 8 minutes. Braskem then undertook an investigation of the incident, and determined that the engine of the truck at Rack 15 was the ignition source of the fire, as the engine temperature under unloading conditions exceeded that needed to ignite propylene. As a result of the investigation, operational procedures for unloading propylene, driver qualifications, and testing of unloading equipment were revised to provide detailed instruction to Braskem and contract drivers to govern activities both prior to and during unloading operations. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Programs\r\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response program for the"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. In addition, the procedures address all relevant aspects of emergency response, including:\r\n-- Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\r\n-- Evacuation and shelter-in-place plans \r\n-- Procedures to ensure that all personnel are accounted for following an incident\r\n-- Notification procedures for local emergency response agencies\r\n-- Post-incident cleanup and decontamination procedures, and\r\n-- Inspecting, testing maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes a number of monitoring, detection, and suppression systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate fires and releases of hazardous materials. These include:\r\n-- Computerized and local process control / alarm / interlock shutdown systems.\r\n-- Hydrocarbon and flame detectors.\r\n-- Automatic and manually activated water spray/sprinkler systems\r\n-- Fire extinguishers\r\n-- Centralized alarm system.\r\n-- Communications Systems: Radios, Emergency Phones, PA system, Emergency Call Procedures.\r\n-- Emergency Evacuation Procedures and Drills.\r\n-- Fire Water System: Hydrants, Monitors, Hose Stations, and Backup Firewater system.\r\n-- Diking and Burn Pits for Pyrophoric Liquids.\r\n\r\nThe Marcus Hook Site maintains a trained emergency response team to respond to fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies. The emergency response team routinely trains and conducts drills to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. \r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program provides planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Detailed facility emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the local emergency planning committee, fire department, police department, an"

These plans include:\r\n-- Emergency Reporting through the County LEPC (911).\r\n-- Agency reporting: PA-DEP, National Response Center, State Emergency Operations Center.\r\n-- Environmental Advisory Committee Reporting\r\n-- SARA Hazardous Material Reporting, County and Local, State\r\n-- Mutual Aid Agreements.\r\n-- Drills with local Emergency Response Teams and area Company Response Teams.\r\n\r\nThe facility updates its emergency response program, as appropriate, in response to modifications to facility processes.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nBraskem has adopted a philosophy of continuous improvement. Programs are in place to monitor the status of ongoing efforts and continually seek opportunities to improve. For example, the facility maintains the Braskem Employee Safety Team (BEST), a multi-disciplinary team with the goal of identifying methods to continuously improve Safety. A few notable projects include the following:\r\n-- Installation of low power shutdowns on large centrifugal propylene pumps that will reduce the likelihood of releasing flammable material due to seal failure.\r\n-- Installation of captive key/lock system in propylene dryer regeneration system that will reduce the likelihood of releasing flammable material due to vessel overpressure.\r\n-- Installation of high level shutdowns on vessels that will reduce the likelihood of releasing flammable material due to vessel overfill."
