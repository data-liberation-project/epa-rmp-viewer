      "SummaryText": "Sea Lion Technologies operates a small chemical processing and warehousing facility near Texas City, Texas.  Sea Lion is introducing a new chemical, nitric acid, on site in quantities above the EPA?s Risk Management Plan threshold for this substance.\n\nWhile Sea Lion has been in compliance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management, this is the first required submission for the Risk Management Plan.  Sea Lion is in the process of commissioning a new process, The Civic Process, which includes large quantities of ntiric acid.  The anticipated start-up for the Civic Process in November 5, 2003.  Sea Lion has conducted a Process Hazards Analysis, modified their Process Safety Information and taken steps to minimize the likelihood and consequences of a release of nitric acid.\n\nThe worst-case offsite consequences for a release of nitric acid includes a radius of 1.4 miles.  This distance includes the plant, approximately 100 homes, a shopping mall, but no schools, hospitals or other receptors.  The alternate case scenario for nitric acid has an impact radius of 0.2 miles and includes only approximately 4 homes and not other receptors.\n\nThe prevention program at Sea Lion includes proper materials of construction, appropriate control systems, interlock systems, and relief systems.  In the event of a release, Sea Lion has a dike for containment and an emergency response plan which include coordination and cooperation with other local industrial sites.\n\nManagement is committed to a safe process and has taken every foreseeable measure to ensure the safety of the employees and the nearby community."
