This process includes protecting the community, environment, and personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for this facility, which are available to all\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nAs part of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s commitment to safe and environmentally friendly operations, monthly meetings are conducted with all employees as well as other more specific operational meetings concerning safety. Input and comments from plant personnel are also key aspects of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s safety practices: By giving personnel the ability to make suggestions regarding safety and operational practices, the facility can operate efficiently and safely.
