The buildings were built over time from 1913 - 1993 and the facility was more recently owned/operated by Swanson, Campbell Soup Company, and Vlasic Foods. The Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") program was developed for the facility in 1994/1995 under Campbell?s. The original Risk Management Program was developed by Vlasic using the existing PSM and the initial Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") was submitted to EPA on June 18, 1999.  Pinnacle Foods Corporation purchased the facility out of bankruptcy in May 2001.  A name change re-submission was sent to the EPA on January 23, 2002. \n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPinnacle is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner. Pinnacle strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. Pinnacle is also committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety in the workplace and the protection of the environment.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nIt is Pinnacle Foods Group Inc. / Pinnacle Foods Corporation policy that we will promote overall public and associate safety by developing, implementing and maintaining all required elements of the EPA?s RMP provisions and OSHA?s PSM standard regarding the storage, handling, and processing of anhydrous ammonia used at this facility.  The incorporation of these programs helps to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, a"

The Facility?s Director of Manufacturing is responsible for the implementation of the RMP.  In turn, he has designated the facility Corporate Safety Director as PSM coordinator having overall authority for, and oversight of, the Facility RMP. As part of the PSM and Risk Management Program, the Facility has an Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Manual which provides instructions and responsibilities required of all facility personnel in case of the following plant emergencies: employee illness/injury, ammonia release, fire, and severe weather. The manual also provides procedures and responsibilities for controlled and emergency shutdowns of facility equipment. The management team is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures at the Pinnacle facility.  \n\n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility is located on approximately 6 acres in eastern Omaha near the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska.  The facility consists of several interconnected buildings with over 274,000 square feet under roof. The primary purpose of our facility is the production of frozen entrees.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers anhydrous ammonia hazardous; therefore, the properties, which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant, also necessitate certain safety precautions.  A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance (toxic or f"

We operate one refrigeration system with an inventory of approximately 105,000 pounds.  \n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFor the purposes of this 2004 RMP re-submittal, only minor incidents have occurred and no accidental releases resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in-place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred at the facility within the past five years.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon accepted and proven engineering design practices for a safe operating refrigeration plant.  The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ASHRAE Standard 15 and the National Electrical Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  Depending on location and use in the system, pressure vessels are ASME rated and fitted with either a single or dual safety relief valve as required by ASME.\n\nThe Pinnacle Foods facility complies with applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Operators/Mechanics receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are given written tests and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge. \n\nPinnacle has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Program for ammonia use and storage.

An automatic ammonia detection system (\"ADS\") also provides reliable notification of ammonia releases.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan covers the ammonia refrigeration system in accordance with Process Safety and Risk Management.  Our emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.   If a release of ammonia is detected by the ADS or by employees, the procedures within this manual will be followed including notification of hazardous materials responders (refrigeration mechanics) by radio and as required, the involvement of the incident commander. The manual describes the level of personnel protective equipment to be used to respond to ammonia incidents.  Facility responders have received initial and annual refresher training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs on an annual basis.\n\nPinnacle has an in-house HAZMAT team that initially responds and works in conjunction the Douglas County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Omaha Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  The Fire Department and Police will handle public notification, under the control of the LEPC.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns. Pinnacle will work with these agencies as necessary to notify the public about an ammonia release. The manual also contains procedures for emergency alerting and response procedures for on-site personnel, off-site emergency contacts, and adjacent plants.

Our program is improved continuously through annual updating of our written program and annual training of our technicians.  We also take advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available.\n\nThis facility is scheduled to be shutdown by Pinnacle Foods in the last quarter of 2004.  Once the ammonia has been removed from the plant, a de-registration submission will be provided to the EPA."
