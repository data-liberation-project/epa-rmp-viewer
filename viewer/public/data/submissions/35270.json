These programs enable our facility to reduce the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases as well as fires, explosions, and any other type of accident.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and can also avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nThe safety programs are implemented in order to reduce both the number and severity of accidents because they focus on the policy, procedures, and safe practices that govern individual processes and activities on specific pieces of equipment.  These programs are communicated and accepted by every employee and this facility.\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state NH3 from a gas to a liquid.  It is classified as a closed system process.  The total ammonia inventory on site includes 37,000 pounds.  The ammonia is used in the freezing of broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, beans, pasta, asparagus, and for cold storage.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia specific prevention steps was developed as a requirement and is in compliance with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA RMP Program regulatio"
