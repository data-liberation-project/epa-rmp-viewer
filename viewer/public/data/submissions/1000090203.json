      "SummaryText": "A.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIKO is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures maintenance, and employee and contractor training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we will coordinate with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to provide trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nB.    STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe IKO facility's primary activity is the manufacture polyurethane insulation boards and synthetic rubber roofing membrane sheets. A storage and injection system consisting of up to approximately 140,000 pounds of n-pentane is used as a blowing agent in the manufacturing process. There are three areas at which n-pentane is considered to present a potential fire hazard, the bulk storage area (n-pentane tank), piping from the tank farm to the metering machine and from the metering machine to the mix head, and the metering pump tables. At any one time, the greatest quantity of n-pentane on site is in the storage tank.\n\nC.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIKO has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA RMP accidental release prevention requirements and the OSHA PSM standard. The facility has an air operating permit from the Maryland Department of the Environment and a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at IKO.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIKO maintains a detailed record of safety informa"

Chemical hazards are described on the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for n-pentane. SDSs are maintained on the site intranet. Further process safety information is contained within the Plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIKO has conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP methodology was used to carry out the initial analysis. Subsequent analyses will be performed using this or other comparable methodologies. The study was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years and when major changes are made to the covered process. Any findings related to the initial hazard analysis have been addressed. Findings of subsequent analyses will be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, IKO maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, and emergency operations. These are controlled documents under the site Quality Management System and the information is reviewed on a regular basis and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nIKO has a comprehensive training program in place tracked using a training matrix to ensure that employees who are operating components of the covered process are competent in the operating procedures associated with these components. Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed. Comprehensive training is also required for all contractors performing work at IKO. This training includes sections on hazards associated with the n-pentane system. Training is coordinated and manage"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes but is not limited to the storage tank, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The maintenance operations are done by qualified personnel with prior training in maintenance practices and experience with the n-pentane system. These personnel are provided specialized training as needed. If necessary, trained contract personnel may also be utilized for mechanical integrity work. Preventative maintenance activities are performed on an ongoing basis with components of the n-pentane system covered at least annually. Visual inspections of all equipment and components in n-pentane service will be visually inspected at least once per calendar quarter.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at IKO to manage changes in covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The facility uses the Management of Change checklist to ensure the proper process is followed and documented when changes to the n-pentane system or n-pentane using process equipment are necessary. Operations, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the covered process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to additions and modifications to the covered process are conducted as a regular practice at IKO. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nIKO conducts peri"

Any corrective actions required because of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. Formal audits are completed no less frequently than every three years.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIKO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release (\"near miss\") of a regulated substance in accordance with the Corporate Incident Investigation policy and standard operating procedure. Comprehensive investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions that would prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained at the facility for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAssociate involvement in the development and implementation of the Plan is essential to maintain a safe working environment in the presence of a highly hazardous chemical. All facility personnel with responsibilities potentially affecting the covered process will be involved in the various element programs.\n\n\n\nIKO believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and they actively participate in process safety management. IKO employees participate in performing the Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA). IKO employees also have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. Employees are also involved in the development of procedures and their ongoing improvement.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nIKO hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities, including delivery of bulk n-pentane.

Contractors are required to go through initial training prior to performing work at the facility. This training includes information specific to the n-pentane process.\n\n\n\nD.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIKO has not had any accidental releases at the facility over the past five years. Documentation of releases will be maintained as an appendix to the written Plan.\n\n\n\nE.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIKO maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the safety of employees, contractors, and visitors during accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nEmergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning. Upon modification of the covered process, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within the covered process that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nF.    MEASURES IMPLEMENTED TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTo enhance our continuous improvement in occupational safety and health, IKO conducts regular general safety planning meetings which include employee participation.
