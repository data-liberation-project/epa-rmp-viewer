Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Village of Northbrook, Illinois, Water Filtration Plant (the Facility) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we will coordinate with emergency responders to provide trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.

Any findings related to each analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to the covered process, the Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\nThe Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.
