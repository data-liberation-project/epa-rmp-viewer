              "Description": "The Kemira Marietta Plant site consists of multiple processing and storage areas.  Some of these areas fall under the regulations of PSM and RMP.  The PSM and RMP areas are clearly defined as part of our Process Hazard Management Program and specifically within our Unit Safety File.  Site wide, many OSHA required and site specific Safety or Emergency policies and practices are incorporated into our training, operations, maintenance, and administrative functions to insure a safe work environment.  The plant site has been designed and inspected in accordance with good engineering practices as well as preventive maintenance inspections.  For those areas determined to contain flammable, reactive, toxic, or corrosive materials, emergency systems are in place such as containment, sprinkler and/or deluge systems, fire water monitors, foam suppression, alarm stations, and spill clean up kits.  The review and inspections of these systems as well as mock drills are conducted routinely.  The plant is equipped with trained emergency responders capable of handling spills and releases of onsite materials.  The plant has administrative procedures that are followed to prevent releases as a result of inappropriate materials or inappropriate installation.  These consist of Management of Change, Pre-Job Inspection, Line Break, Lock-Out-Tag-Out, and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews/Inspections.  Within the PSM/RMP defined areas, we practice multiple chemistries which may or may not contain regulated chemicals.  For this reason, we have utilized the PSM guidance which allows Process Hazard Analysis to be manufacturing specific as opposed to equipment specific and as a result, the RMP listed chemicals in this plant may or may not be found in all the dated PHA information provided with this submission.",

RMP Submission 2007\n\nMarietta Plant \n\n\n\nExecutive Summary \n\n\n\nKemira Chemicals, Inc. is a chemical manufacturing company based in Kennesaw, GA.  We produce products for several diverse industries, including paper manufacturing, pigment mining, textile sizing, paint manufacturing, water treatment, and agricultural pest control.\n\nThe Marietta plant manufactures products for the paper, paint, pigment mining, and textile sizing markets.  The portion of the plant that is covered by Risk Management makes acrylic polymers that are sold to companies in the above markets.  The polymer production facility has been in operation for 31 years, utilizing state of the art process control instrumentation as well as emissions control units including a thermal oxidation unit and an onsite wastewater pretreatment plant.\n\nOSHA regulations (Process Safety Management) for several years have required that multiple Layers of Protection be included during design, before startup and to continue through operations and training of all employees.  These Layers of Protection are maintained today as part of our Risk Management Programs.   \n\nThe polymer plant currently uses one raw material that is covered under Risk Management: ammonia solution.  \n\n\n\nAmmonium Hydroxide Solution:\n\nColorless liquid with a pungent, ammonia odor\n\nLiquid ammonium hydroxide is lighter than water\n\nAmmonia vapor is lighter than air\n\nContact with the eyes can result in severe irritation or blindness\n\nContact with the skin can cause burns or blistering\n\nInhalation of high concentrations can cause respiratory distress\n\n\n\nAs part of Kemira's stewardship and safety programs, we recognize the hazards of handling and processing ammonia.  The design of our ammonia storage and handling systems takes all of the hazards of each material into consideration.  Materials handling, from unloading through process vessels, are in closed venting systems or when venting is required, is routed through scrubbers design"

Our storage tank is insulated and temperature controlled.\n\nThe polymer reaction systems (as well as loading and unloading systems) are monitored by computers and by trained operators.  Interlocks in the computer logic, for example, are designed to prevent a storage tank from being overfilled.  Operator double-checks are in place to assure all valves are in the proper position and that all safety observations and checks are properly completed.\n\nAll material transfers are through closed pipe systems.  Vapor return lines are used in most unloading procedures to return the displaced vapor to the delivery vehicle.  Additionally, all reaction vessels use a series scrubber unit complete with a hydrocarbon analyzer to measure the VOC output on a continuous basis.  Vent lines to the monomer storage tanks and monomer feed tanks are hard piped to the scrubber, after which residual vapors pass through the thermal oxidation unit.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario to be the sudden and complete loss of a truck (approximately 45000 lbs) of ammonia solution.  The only safety precautions that Risk Management allows to be considered in the Worst Case Scenario are passive mitigation devices.  In our case, the ammonia storage tank is surrounded by concrete dike containment, however the truck sits in a separate contained area outside of the tank dike.  The contents of a ruptured or leaking truck would empty into the contained unloading pad, which would drain into sumps and eventually a containment pond.  This routing would limit the surface area from which ammonia could evaporate.  Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate evaporated ammonia would travel approximately 0.2 miles.  This distance is based on the assumption of urban terrain.  Within the affected area, a popul"

There could potentially be a higher number of people affected during business hours or passing through the area on local roads.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenarios:  While the alternative scenario is still unlikely to occur, it is more likely to happen than the Worst Case Scenario discussed above.  In the Alternative Case Scenario for ammonia solution, EPA's Offsite Guidance allows us to presume our Layers of Protection, our safety processes, our safety programs, our safety equipment, and our people will be available for response.  While this scenario is more likely to happen than the Worst Case and is the scenario used for Emergency Planning, our safety systems are designed to prevent them from happening.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario - Analysis of our systems indicate that the most likely toxic scenario would be a liquid release from an open 3/4\" vent, a drain valve, a small rupture in transfer piping, or a failed gasket at the storage tank.   A release of this magnitude, occurring in such a manner would be contained within the tank's diked area.  Mitigation systems include a concrete containment dike.  A sprinkler system, a deluge system, water curtain, and foam suppression exist as emergency shutdown systems.  These mitigation systems (except for the dike) are not used in calculating the endpoint because it is assumed the event would go unnoticed, although this is unlikely for the time duration of the event.  In such a case, we estimate the loss to be approximately 68200 lbs over 360 minutes.  Using EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate the ammonia vapor would travel 0.1 miles before the concentration dispersed to a level considered by EPA to be non-hazardous.  Within this area, a population of 4 would potentially be affected, including primarily commercial and industrial facilities.  Again, a higher number of pe"

These other flammable materials, however, are not regulated under RMP.  Regardless, we have systems in place for these flammable materials that are designed to prevent accidents and to respond to accidents if they occur.\n\nThe polymer plant at Marietta is designed to prevent releases and to minimize hazards from flammable materials.  Where flammable materials are stored or processed, inert (gas) padding systems are employed to minimize the potential for fires or explosions.  In addition, vessels and piping are grounded to minimize static or electrical ignition such as from lightning strikes.  \n\nIn the event of a fire on the plant site, our emergency response teams are trained to evaluate the magnitude of the fire and if it is within their capability, to fight it until outside assistance arrives.  Our fire fighting systems include four teams that make up an incipient Fire Brigade with a plant-wide response time of less than three minutes, 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Capabilities include water supply from two different headers coming into the plant and two auxiliary pumping systems; both with internal emergency power.\n\n\n\nAccident History:  In the past five years, this facility has had no incidents with RMP regulated materials causing an offsite consequence.  We have experienced occasions when citizens have reported objectionable odors coming from the Marietta plant.  There have been no reported offsite consequences.  Regardless, we have an obligation to determine the source(s) of these odors and to take actions to prevent a recurrence.  In each instance of an odor complaint, we have investigated the cause and as applicable, corrected the problem and/or taken actions to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\nGoals:  The goal at Kemira is to produce quality products and to produce them sa"

Following is a partial listing of the Layers of Protection that we employ in our everyday activities.\n\n\n\nDesign: Since the inception of OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, we used best engineering practices to assure our systems would operate as intended.  All changes or additions to the processes undergo a formal review and approval procedure.  This triggers hazard analysis and design safety reviews as necessary.  We have concrete dikes to catch any spilled materials.\n\nAll of our valve systems are designed to fail in safe positions.  This means that in the event of a computer failure or loss of electrical or air power, valves will return open or closed as necessary to the \"safe\" position.  In addition, we have both backup battery systems for computers and an auxiliary generator in case of power failure.\n\nOn a regular schedule, we are required to complete a comprehensive review of the hazards and operability of our entire production system.  If we find a valve, pipe, tank, or pump that might fail and allow a release or an incident, we will correct it immediately.\n\n\n\nMaintenance:  We have formal mechanical integrity and preventative maintenance programs in place.  Tanks and piping undergo thickness testing for assessing life and to determined needs for repair or replacement before failure.  Our operators will recheck equipment before operating it, after maintenance has been performed on it.  Using a combination of safety and quality programs, all of our instruments are calibrated and our storage and transfer systems are tested on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nSafe Operations:  Our employees are essential to the safe operation of our plant.

All activities in the polymer plant - from unloading railcars to filling trucks with finished product - are restricted to trained, designated employees.\n\nActivities in the polymer plant are computer aided.  This means that some actions taken by an operator are checked against an internal list in the computer's memory as well as with remote sensors to make sure it is the correct action.  On plant operations designated as having high risk potential, we have systems designed to automatically manage emergency interlocks that will shut down selected transfers to some vessels, shut down pumps, or automatically cool vessels.\n\nThe equipment and systems that contain these materials are closed; that is, the materials are contained in equipment that is designed to prevent materials from reaching the atmosphere or environment.  This extends from the time we unload a railcar of raw materials until we move them through storage tanks to the processing vessels.\n\n\n\nAuditing:  Kemira's Quality System at Marietta is certified according to ISO9001 standards.  While directed at quality, the training and documentation requirements of ISO guidelines are quite similar to those for OSHA and EPA under Process Safety Management and Risk Management.\n\nIn addition to the audits required by all three of these guidelines, we are regularly visited, inspected and/or audited by regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:  Our operators are trained to identify unusual occurrences.  We have Emergency Response Teams in place at the Marietta plant.  These individuals undergo significantly more training than do operators; have cell phone/two-way radio capabilities and a designated and fully equipped Emergency Operations Center from which to operate.\n\nIn the event of an incident on the plant site, our Emergency Response Plan tells us to take the following actions: An alarm system will notify all employees that an event has occurred.

We have our Layers of Protection in the plant; we use training exercises to further protect our employees and to reduce the impact of any releases on our neighbors.\n\nTraining is extended to include local Fire and Emergency Services groups that may service our plant.  Through these training exercises, we are developing and maintaining partnerships.  These partnerships allow us to gain confidence in each other's knowledge and abilities to deal appropriately with incidents.  Shared roles in incident response are intended to assure the public, and ourselves, that we can and will react properly and promptly when necessary.\n\n\n\nKemira Chemicals, Inc. is an active current member of the Cobb County Resource Council, a partnership of government and industry designed to share information, technology, equipment, and resources in the event of an incident.\n\n"
