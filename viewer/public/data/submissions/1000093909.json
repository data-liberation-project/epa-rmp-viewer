The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger.  The Albertsons - Irvine plant manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn March 2021, the facility completed an independent Mechanical Integrity Inspection and is following-up on recommendations resulting from that study. The safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1.  Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3.  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4.

The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow facility personnel to monitor system operations.  This monitoring system is comprised of liquid level controls, pressure and temperature controls and indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility personnel to effectively monitor and control refrigeration operations. \r\n\r\nThe facility is equipped with ammonia gas detectors.  The Freezer warehouses have detectors located in the Engine Room, in the warehouse, and on the building's roof. \r\n\r\nThe operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems is contracted out to a professional refrigeration firm.  This ensures that the system is maintained properly by refrigeration experts and according to industry standards.  The refrigeration contractor is available 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.

The freezer warehouse uses 36000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system, which operates continuously. Compressors and condenser cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  Cold storage and dock areas use evaporators to maintain room temperatures.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage and dock areas.\r\n\r\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions for the Freezer ammonia system range from 3 Hg on the low-pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the ammonia refrigeration equipment is located inside the respective engine room. The condensers are mounted on the respective engine room roof and the evaporators are placed in their respective dock or storage areas.  Access to the engine room is limited to authorized personnel.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Albertsons - Irvine has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal OSHA 5189 regulation.
