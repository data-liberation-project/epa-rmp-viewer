To help us achieve a workplace that is safe and free from hazards    (i.e., chemical release), we have developed different safety programs and policies.  The QTF Foods processing plant uses ammonia as a refrigerent, which is considered hazardous by OSHA & the EPA.  Because of the hazardous properties associated with ammonia it is necessary to observe the many safety precautions in the handling of ammonia in our process.  It is QTF's policy to adhere to all applicable Fed. and State rules and regulations while using guidance to best management pratices as established by the Industrial Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  Safe handling of ammonia is the result of safety features built into the system, along with training and safe handling procedures observed by our refrigeration personnel.\n  The QTF Food's emergancy response to a accidental chemical release based on OSHA's requirements for emergancy action & response planning.  We have contracted with Boots & Coots an outside agency certified in hazardous material response.  Boots & Coots offices are located on QTF Food's property.\n\n        Description of facility & the regulated substance handled.\n\n  The Quik-to-Fix Foods, Garland Plant is part of an independant, value-added meat company with a long and successful history of supplying products to foodservice operators through a national distribution system.  The regulated substance used at our location is ammonia.  Ammonia, due due to its enviromental friendliness, economic and energy efficiencies is used with a closed system as a refrigerent for temprature control and product freezing.  Access to our process is restricted to authorized management personn"

      "SummaryText": "el, plant employees and contractors.\n\n         Worst Case Scenario.\n\n    Failure of our largest storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed would result in the release of 8,300 lbs. of ammonia.  The amount of ammonia release from the storage vessel, enclosed in a ventilated room, would be in liquid form which would vaporize into the surrounding atmosphere.  Ammonia has a strong, pungent odor and is colorless in a gass or liquid state.  Ammonia is not considered flammable but upon reaching a determined level of concentration within an enclosed space can be explosive.\n  The distance to endpoint under the worst case conditions, ammonia could travel 1 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This was determined using EPA's RMP*Comp program.\n\n        Alternative Case Scenario.\n\n  Due to possible over pressurization within the ammonia system, a relief valve system is used and designed to release any pressure build up to the atmosphere.  This system prevents and over pressure situation which may cause vessel or pipe failure.  Ammonia released through the relief valve system would be of vapor form.  Relief valves are designed to close when the over pressurization situation is controlled which can be done manually or through computor controls.\n  The distance to endpoint for the alternative scenario is calculated at 1100 feet.  This release has the possibilityof extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n        General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n  The ammonia system within the Garland Plant is within compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management Program.  IIAR guidlines are implemented in the process.  Key to the prevention system is our backup system and our automated Emergency cut off switches.\n\n        Five year accident history.\n\n  No releases noted within the past five yeays.\n\n        Emergency Response Program\n\n  The QTF Foods, Garland Plant has "
