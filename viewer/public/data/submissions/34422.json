This plant, which treats surface water from South Fork Mill Creek, is located in a rural setting and provides 90% of the water used within the city for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes.\n\nDisinfection is a critical aspect of water treatment, essential to providing a safe drinking water supply.  The Wicks WTP utilizes chlorine as its primary and residual disinfectant.  The chlorine is received and stored as a liquified gas under pressure in one-ton containers; up to five containers may be on-site at any one time for a total maximum inventory of 10,000 pounds of chlorine.  Due to the quantity of chlorine stored at the Wicks WTP, US-EPA regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Section 112 (r)(7) has mandated the development of the following Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The chlorine process at this facility is a Program 3 process under these regulations.\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for chlorine has been developed for the Wicks WTP as required by OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  This PSM program was developed with input from all operational levels of staff and includes, in part, a summary of process safety information, the methodology and results of a site-specific Process Hazard Analysis, written operating procedures for all aspects of the chlorine processes, and required training schedules for all affected personnel.  The purpose and goal of the PSM program is to prevent any uncontrolled or catastrophic releases of chlorine and to protect on-site personnel in event of such a release.  Compliance with all aspects of the PSM program is mandatory for all affected employees by City policy.  There have been no accidents at the Wicks WTP relative to the chlorine processes within the last ten years.\n\nA Chlorine Emergency Response Plan has been also developed for the Wicks WTP.  In this plan, plant personnel and other City resources coordi"
