      "SummaryText": "This Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Quad County Corn Processors (QCCP).  QCCP is an ethanol production facility located near the city of Galva, Ida County, Iowa.  This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The QCCP facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, and natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, above the threshold quantities (covered processes).\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nQCCP is committed to protecting the environment and operating its facility in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, QCCP has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of hazardous materials. \r\n\r\nThe facility relies on outside services, LEPC, Fire, and Police to respond to major release events. In the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response is described in its emergency action plan. The emergency action plan includes procedures to provide information to and coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the emergency action plan is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of material handled and internal emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\n2. Facili"

      "SummaryText": "ty Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nQCCP is a corn-based denatured ethanol fuel production plant. Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol through a continuous fermentation and distillation process.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\r\n\r\nRegulated substances stored at the facility include aqueous ammonia, which is used for pH control and as a nutrient in the fermentation process, and natural gasoline, which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\r\n\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nQCCP is subject to and has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol, denaturant (natural gasoline), and anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nQCCP encourages employees to participate in safety management and accident prevention at the facility.  Through its PSM Program, QCCP has developed an employee participation program.  All process safety information (PSI), process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, and action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Process Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nThe facility has completed PHAs utilizing the HAZOP methodology, and the PHA is revalidated at least every five years.  The controlled copy of the PHA is maintained at the facility and details the PHA methodology used, items reviewed, PHA team composition, and findings/corrective actions.\r\n\r\nQCCP maintains documents detailing the process safe"

The operating procedures that have been developed have been prepared as a guide for those involved with initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown of the process. The Facility has an operating procedures training program for employees involved in facility operations.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nQCCP's contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nQCCP conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the PSI. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nQCCP's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nQCCP has safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. These safety standards include, but are not limited to, controlling entry into work areas and confined spaces, specific procedures to follow for isolating energy sources by lockout/tag-out and describe the permitting process for completing work in the facility. Safety standards and work procedures are reviewed annually. \r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nQCCP has a hot work permit program that"

A permit is required in covered process areas for cutting, welding, spark-producing equipment, etc., except in designated areas. The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nQCCP's management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nQCCP has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a release of a regulated substance. The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nQCCP conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.  An RMP compliance audit is conducted at least every three years.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe covered processes at the facility include hazards"

The programs consist of procedures for responding to releases, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address emergency response (including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures), evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, QCCP has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions on the use of emergency response equipment.
