      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBridgepoint Northlake, LLC has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for their 555 Northwest Avenue, Northlake, IL warehouse (555 Warehouse) to present the compliance elements of the US EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\nThe intent of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), a regulated substance, and to mitigate the severity of a potential release that may occur. A written copy of the RMP is available to Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public, upon request. The key elements of the RMP are presented below.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\n\n\nThe 555 Warehouse maintains a refrigeration system used to refrigerate grocery products on site. Ammonia is the refrigerant used in the refrigeration systems. The ammonia refrigeration systems are closed-loop systems and consist of vessels, piping, valves, and other process equipment. All refrigeration vessels are located inside the warehouse buildings. The Freezer system is charged with 66,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle consists of compressing and expanding ammonia and changing the physical state from high pressure liquid, to low pressure liquid, to low pressure vapor, to high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (e.g. lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature). Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration. Typical operating conditions range from approximately 0 psig on the low-pressure side to approximately 180 psig on the high pressure side. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is a very efficient refrigerant. It is the most environmentally friendly refrigerant in existence and does not contribute to global warming. It has been in use successfully as a refrigerant for more than 100 years. Dominick's has been using ammonia at the 555 Warehouse for over decades.\n\n\n\nAC"

For example, the ammonia refrigeration system is continually being monitored and controlled by a monitoring and control system. The system controls the mechanical functions, which ensures proper operation of the refrigeration system. Various redundant safety control parameters are built into the program. Indoor area monitors are located in the compressor rooms to detect system releases.\n\n\n\nPersonnel responsible for the refrigeration system receive OSHA, on-the-job, and industry recommended training. Physical equipment inspections are conducted daily.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Update which conducted a review of the accident history during the last five years the 555 Warehouse has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of ammonia. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe 555 Warehouse has prepared an Emergency Action Plan which outlines the reporting, notification, evacuation, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure proper response to and reporting of an emergency situation. The Emergency Action Plan procedures were designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nBridgepoint"
