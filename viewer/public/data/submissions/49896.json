The primary purpose of this facility is the park and storage of tanker trucks and distribute ammonia to the customer base.\n\nEmployees conduct proper start-up procedures for these processes. The ammonia system must start with the proper setting and securing of the ammonia trailer utilizing wheel chocks, warning signs, and grounding equipment. Once this is accomplished, they can hook-up all items necessary to off-load ammonia at the customer's facility. Visual tanker checks including but not limited to tare weight, ownership stamp, valve threadings, etc. are inspected. These written procedures are followed each day. Maintenance, if deemed necessary, is contracted out to qualified companies who have trained personnel to utilize in the proper maintenance of these systems. The mechanical integrity of the system is maintained in the manner, for these contractors have copies of, or access to the O&M manuals for all systems. This facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements. They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication Program, Confined Space Program (if ever needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases for this facility.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc., the Houston LEPC (Joe Leonard, Jr.), and the Houston Fire Department. If a release were to occur at this location, employees would be notified of the release. Plant Manager (Victor Martinez) will get personnel organized for an emergency action and possible evacuation , If the operator of the system in question tried to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency electrical shutoff switch will be utilized to turn off "

If the release cannot be stopped, notification to the Houston Fire Deparment via 911 call will be made. The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location, and are trained in HazMat operations. This 911 call will also notify the Houston LEPC so that notification, and if needed, evacuation of the affected area can begin.\n\nThis facility has a toxic worst case scenario. The worst case scenario for a toxic release would be the failure of the tractor trailer vessel storing Ammonia. This release, if the trailer were full, would have a release of 40,000 pounds of ammonia. Activve mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves, and manual shutoffs. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. The distance to endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 3.6 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered rural. This release scenario could impact approximately 68,000 persons in a 40 square mile radius. This information was determined using RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nAn alternate toxic release for this location would be the most probable release; a transfer hose leak. The transfer hoses at this location are high pressure stainless steel. Over time, the hoses begin to get crimps, which could lead to a small hole in the transfer hose. If this were to happen with the ammonia, an estimated release rate would be approximately 1 pound per minute for 10 minutes. This 10 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint for .14 mg/l of less than 0.03 miles. Within this small area there would be approximately 0 persons affected. There are no residences in this area so the numbers would be the surrounding office/manufacturing facilities.\n\nThere has not been an accidental release from this facility in the past five years."
