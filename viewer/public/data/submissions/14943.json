This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTessenderlo Kerley owns and operates the Sahuarita Facility located in Sahuarita, Arizona.  The facility produces liquid xanthate and dry xanthate.  The liquid xanthate production is a batch process.  The mixture is circulated and agitated until laboratory analysis confirms the reaction is complete.  The finished xanthate solution is filtered and pumped to storage.\n\nThe products made in the liquid plant are as follows:\n\nSodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX)\nPotassium amyl xanthate (PAX)\nSodium iso-butyl xanthate (SIBX)\nSodium n-butyl xanthate (SNBX)\nSodium ethyl xanthate (SEX)\n\nCarbon disulfide is common to all of the reactions.  Sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX) is the product generated by the dry xanthate plant process.  Since this reaction is exothermic and produces a solid, pentane is introduced to form a pumpable xanthate slurry and also to absorb the heat of reaction.  After drying, the solid pellets are then weighed into fiber-board or steel drums for storage or shipment.\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified one listed flammable substance and one toxic regulated substance kept on site.  The chemicals,"

Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat Teams), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Sahuarita Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to \n\ndiscuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise (operators).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: \n\n1. age of process; \n2. extent of process hazards; \n3. number of affected employees; and \n4. operating history of the process.  \n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten procedures are to be maintained that address various modes of process operations, such as the following: \n\n1. initial startup; \n2. normal operations; \n3. temporary operations; \n4. emergency shutdown; \n5. emergency operations; \n6. normal shutdown; \n7. startup following a turnaround; and \n8. start up after emergency shutdown.  \n These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. \n\nOperating procedures are to be periodically reviewed and will be periodically certified as current and accurate.

To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is to be a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees are to receive basic training in process operations and procedures. In addition, all operators are to periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at acceptable level.  This refresher training is to be conducted at least every three years.  The appropriate frequency of training is to be based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is to be documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Sahuarita Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, there are to be procedures in place to ensure that contractors do as follows: \n\n1. perform their work in a safe manner;\n2. have appropriate knowledge and skills;\n3. are aware of the hazards of their workplace;\n4. understand what they should do in the event of an emergency;\n5. understand and follow site specific safety rules;\n6. inform plant personnel of any hazards th"

Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place an adequate. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be kept.
