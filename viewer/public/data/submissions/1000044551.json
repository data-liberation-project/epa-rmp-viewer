The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  This Plan is being filed as part of the 2009 RMP Update and Revalidation. This Plan is being filed to fulfill requirements of the 2009 RMP Update and Revalidation.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe City of Redding operates two wastewater treatment plants.  Its Stillwater Wastewater Treatment Plant serves that portion of the City of Redding located east of the Sacramento River.  It is located at 6475 Airport Road, Anderson, CA in Shasta County, and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located on the west bank of the Sacramento River just north of the City of Anderson.  There are 6 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are recei"

      "SummaryText": "ved in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and storage trunnions inside the building.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the wastewater effluent, and for other process uses.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control.  Pressurized gas within a ton container is withdrawn under pressure and piped to a vacuum regulator valve located in the storage room where the gas pressure is reduced to vacuum.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators and sulfonators located in an adjacent room for chlorine and in a small building at the outfall for sulfur dioxide. The gases, under partial vacuum are drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Redding that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of either gas to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Redding has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the processes; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs inst"

The City of Redding has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection and dechlorination process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for City of Redding's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, creation of facility-specific operation procedures for chemical delivery with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Redding's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Redding Fire Department and the Shasta Cascade Hazardous Materials Response Team (SCHMRT). The City of Redding maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases at its facilities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which the City of Redding committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  It is planned to eliminate the chlorine and sulfur dioxide pressure piping and mount vacuum regulators directly on the ton container gas valves in 2014.  All of the other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\n"
