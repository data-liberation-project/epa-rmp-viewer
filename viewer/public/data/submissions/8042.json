      "SummaryText": "The Hanson Cold Storage Co. - Lafayette Division facility located in Lafayette, Indiana is a cold storage warehouse that has a refrigeration system containing ammonia which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this warehouse is to store products for various companies at either subzero temperatures or at \"refrigerator\" temperature to preserve and / or extend the life of the product.  Modernization in 1999 included replacement of the entire ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAmmonia is used at the warehouse to refrigerate rooms to maintain a correct temperature as required by the customer.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the warehouse refrigeration system, providing the means to maintain specified temperature and / or remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the warehouse and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from rooms within the warehouse.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this warehouse.  \n\nThe warehouse refrigeration system was constructed using existing codes and standards including the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and is in compliance with state codes.  This cold storage warehouse complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe warehouse ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using various methods such as on the job training, equipment manufacturers training sessions, tapes and literature from the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Associ"

      "SummaryText": "ation (RETA), a nationally recognized authority in ammonia refrigeration, and contractor explanation and training (contractors are members of IIAR).  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.    \n\nThe emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this warehouse.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The warehouse emergency action plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency action plan has been discussed with the Lafayette Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response. \n\nThe warehouse has had no reportable ammonia releases in the five year history. \n\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia, as defined by EPA, is from the inside high temperature recirculator vessel and could extend beyond the Hanson Cold Storage Co. Lafayette Division property.  An alternative, more likely, release scenario could extend just beyond the property boundary but not in all directions.  \n\nIn all cases of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc.."
