Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers Cooperative Elevator Co. (the Facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department , or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct applicatyion and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 273,000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  A) The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be approximately 1134,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % cvapacity as limited be design standards. the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm, partsb per million) is about 2.4 miles. B) The alternate release scenario, based on the 5 year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint would be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K - 61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and th"

The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility or off-site.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the masintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific additional recommendations to improve safety at this time."
