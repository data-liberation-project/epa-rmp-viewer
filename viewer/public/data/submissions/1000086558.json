This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR Part 68.155.  The Big Stone Plant is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, above the threshold quantities. This RMP submittal is the 5-year update for Big Stone Plant. The first RMP for this facility was submitted on April 24, 2015. The facility introduced anhydrous ammonia to the facility in May 2015. The Big Stone Plant developed the RMP, PSM, and mechanical integrity programs. All programs and safety measures were fully implemented by the time anhydrous ammonia was introduced to the facility in 2015.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nOtter Tail Power Company is committed to protecting the environment and operating facilities in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, Otter Tail Power Company has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  \n\n\n\nThe facility's Offsite Consequences Analysis was reviewed and updated in February 2020.\n\n\n\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP). The ERAP includes procedures to coordinate"

In addition, the ERAP is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of materials handled and Otter Tail Power Company's emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe Big Stone Plant is a coal burning power generation facility that was originally designed to burn lignite fuel and began operation in 1975. In 1995, the boiler was converted to burn Powder River Basin (PRB) fuel. \n\n\n\nBig Stone Plant began construction in 2013 of an Air Quality Control System to reduce NOx air emissions.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported from two storage tanks to a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system. The anhydrous ammonia is vaporized by injecting the liquid anhydrous ammonia into the heated dilution air provided by the primary air system. The ammonia-air mixture flows through a distribution manifold system into an injection grid. The injection grid distributes the mixture into the flue gas stream and flows through a catalyst bed where the NH3 and the NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe Big Stone Plant utilizes programs to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, process safety management (PSM) requirements from OSHA, and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information:\n\n\n\nThe facility uses the what-if process hazard analysis (PHA) methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: toxic release, fire, explosion, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, and tornadoes. The facility utilizes process controls such a"

The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\n\n\nThe Big Stone Plant maintains written procedures that address all modes of process operations. The facility has developed the necessary procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system to include the various modes of operations. The facility utilizes a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in facility operations.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Big Stone Plant has a fully implemented Contractor Safety Policy and Contractor Pre-qualification Program which provides the minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. These procedures include a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n\n\nBig Stone Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive Mecha"

The Mechanical Integrity Program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain equipment and controls in a safe operating condition.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe facility's Management of Change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Big Stone Plant has a formal Incident Investigation Program and procedures to promptly investigate any incident that could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. The audits include a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with plant personnel.\n\n\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) compliance audit was last conducted at the facility on May 16, 2018, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(o) and 40 CFR Part 68.79.
