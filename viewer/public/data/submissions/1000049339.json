The facility has one 26,000 gallon tank, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck, and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.  \n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank or trucks if a hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.  \n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the Colfax Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.  \n\nOur registration information indicates no full-time employees at this site.  This is because the facility is a seasonal facility that is not actively manned on a full-time basis."
