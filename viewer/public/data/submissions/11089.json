While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the acetylene process at the North Royalton facility, a credible release would be a process piping failure resulting in an acetylene gas release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as joint or a valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the North Royalton facility, a release of this type could result in the released gas igniting, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoint of 1 pound per square inch overpressure is 0.05 miles, or about 264 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the North Royalton facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n7 Documented process safety information to ensure the process desig"

The acetylene gas is purified and then compressed into specially designed acetylene cylinders.  These cylinders can be filled and used individually, or the product can be filled into acetylene cylinders on flatbed trailers.  On an acetylene trailer, the individual cylinders are connected by a piping manifold, which allows acetylene gas to be withdrawn from the entire bank of cylinders.  Acetylene is also listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The acetylene process at the North Royalton plant contains about  24,000 pounds of product, and therefore is subject to the RMP rule.\n\nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report one Worst Scenario for the acetylene process at the North Royalton facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the North Royalton facility, the Worst Case Scenario would involve the acetylene trailer, which contains about 5,300 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.14 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Offsit"
