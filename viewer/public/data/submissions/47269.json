This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00b7Introduction;\n\u00b7Butterball\u00bfs policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7Hazard Assessment;\n\u00b7Prevention Program;\n\u00b7Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7Emergency Response Plan; \n\u00b7Emergency Communications;\n\u00b7Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00b7Planned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00b7Management Program\n\nII.  Butterball\u00bfs Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Butterball; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Butterball is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Butterball\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).
