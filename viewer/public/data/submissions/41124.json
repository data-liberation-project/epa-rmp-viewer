We shall, at minimum: 1) consult with employees on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and 2) provide our employees access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of San Juan Utility Department believes that preventive maintenance is key to minimizing potential for accidental release. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed and reviewed to empower employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner. \n\nThe San Juan Utility Department has taken measures to educate and inform operators, supervisors and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release. The training includes classroom training and operational procedures on the proper response to emergency situations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe San Juan Utility Department has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases. This program includes: safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, incident investigations and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years, there have been no accidental releases from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant p"

It is the department?s philosophy to continually improve the safe working conditions of its employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release. Therefore, it is our intention to incorporate many of the RMP elements into areas of the process not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve the overall safety of the plant(s)."
