Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the WESTSIDE FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 4  regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine is received into St. Albans in 180,000 pound railcars.  This product is then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers and in the manufacture of Sodium Hypchlorite.  Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid and Aqua Ammonia are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid,  and Aqua Ammonia  is  used  for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,247,444 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid,  and Aqua Ammonia  are present at our facility in quantities of 41,150 lbs., 36,900 lbs.  and 30,180 lbs.  respectively.\n\n\n3.

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 180,000 pound railcar of chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class D atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a Ton CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a TON SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum distance of 1.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrofluoric Acid involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3262 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid  in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 6.7 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.44 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release for Aqua Ammonia involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.
