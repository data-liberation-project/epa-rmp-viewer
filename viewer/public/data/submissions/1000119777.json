      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - UTICA CONDENSATE FACILITY\n\nOhio Condensate Company, L.L.C. (OCC), owner and operator of the Utica Condensate Facility, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Utica Condensate Facility handles condensate collected at regional facilities and transported to the station via truck. Upon arrival, the condensate is unloaded into a series of condensate test tanks prior to being pumped into a larger condensate storage tank. Stored condensate is then pumped to a stabilization train which separates volatile hydrocarbons from the condensate, resulting in a less volatile condensate product. The volatile overheads are recondensed and transported offsite via pipeline for further processing. The stabilized condensate is also transported offsite via pipeline. \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined by looking at several scenarios and determining which would have the greatest off-site impact.  Modeling using the EPA's RMP COMP model shows the worst-case scenario is the release from a 2,100,000 gallon condensate storage tank.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario was considered to be a transport truck carrying raw condensate into the facility turning over and releasing its entire contents.  Assuming the truck is at capacity (8,000 gallons) this amounts to a release of 12,556 pounds of flammable mixture.  For calculation purposes in RMP Comp, the entire contents was assumed to be butane.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTA"

Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nOhio Condensate Company, L.L.C. keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nOhio Condensate Company, L.L.C. will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nEach PHA will address the following:\na)\thazards of the process,\nb)\tprevious incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\nc)\tconsequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\nd)\tengineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards an their inter-relationships,\ne)\tfacility siting issues,\nf)\thuman factors.\n\nThe PHA team findings are compiled in a written report and are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assi"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOhio Condensate Company, L.L.C. maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to all employees.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Utica Condensate Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.
