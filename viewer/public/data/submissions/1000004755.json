      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Praxair Distribution facility in Hahnville (Taft), Louisiana produces, handles and/or stores Acetylene and Ethylene.  \n\nThe primary source of acetylene gas at the Hahnville facility is by pipeline from a nearby chemical plant.  The acetylene is a byproduct of a chemical production process.  If necessary, the Hahnville facility also has the capability to generate acetylene by reacting calcium carbide and water. The acetylene gas is compressed into specially designed acetylene cylinders on a  flatbed trailer. These acetylene trailers are then transported as a unit to our customers throughout the country.\n\nThe Hahnville facility receives ethylene gas by pipeline from the same nearby chemical plant.  The ethylene gas is compressed into tube trailers, which are banks of high pressure steel containers mounted on a truck frame. The tube trailers are then transported as a unit to customers throughout the country.  \n\n  \n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n1)  Acetylene -  resale to end market users\n2)  Ethylene - resale to end market users \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes "

Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Hahnville, LA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity. \n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \n\nPraxair has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered processes at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nAcetylene safety systems are designed for manual and automated shutdown.  An operator also attends the process.\nAn incident alarm system can be activated manually that will shutdown the process and activate the deluge system.\n\nEthylene safety systems are designed for manual and automated shutdown"

An operator also attends the process.\nAn incident alarm system can be activated manually that will shutdown the process and activate the deluge system.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Hahnville facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The Hahnville location will be a \"non-responding facility\" as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (July 1998), i.e. Praxair employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\nFor other than minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination St Charles Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), St Charles Mutual Aid Association, and the Hahnville Volunteer Fire Department for regulated flammables.  Copies of the facility emergency plans are shared with these agencies and drills are conducted at least annually.\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the facility emergency action plan.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPraxair has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n"
