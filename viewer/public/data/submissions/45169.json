Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitment of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by the law.\n\nAt the Wilmington facility, we produce commercial grade sulfuric acid from elemental sulfur.  We also manufacture mixed acid by blending oleum and nitric acid.  Oleum and nitric acid are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Wilmington Facility.  There are no regulated flammable substances at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n \nPrevention Program\n\nThe Wilmington Facility has been operating under the stric"

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\t\n\t\n\tEmergency Response Program\n\t\n\tWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Wilmington Facility with the New Hanover County Fire Department and several other area volunteer fire departments.  Also involved in emergency response of the facility would be the Wilmington Hazardous Materials Agency, the New Hanover County Sheriff, and the New Hanover County Emergency Management Agency.  The Wilmington Facility Safety Coordinator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drills, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\t\n\t\n\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\t\n\tDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Wilmington Facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\t\n\u00b7\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\u00b7\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\u00b7\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\u00b7\tIntern"

In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the New Hanover County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7\tInstalling a system to route vent gases from all the oleum tanks through a wet scrubber in order to prevent the SO3 vapors from directly discharging to the atmosphere.  We periodically inspect the wet scrubber to ensure that the scrubber is operated efficiently at all times.\n\u00b7\tInstalling magnetic driven pumps for oleum, thereby avoiding drive shafts and mechanical seals.\n\u00b7\tProviding emergency shutdown buttons at various locations within the facility in order to shut down the processes during emergency situations.\n\u00b7\tProviding an electrical interlock system between the sulfuric acid recirculation pump and the turbine and sulfur pump.  In the event of a failure of the sulfuric acid recirculation pump, the electrical interlock system will shutdown the turbine and the sulfur pump to minimize release of SO3 and SO2 gases to the atmosphere.\n\u00b7\tProviding alarms at the mixed acid loading station.  We have also provided emergency shutdown button at the control room in order to shutdown the mixed acid loading station. \n\u00b7\tInstalling surveillance cameras in order to detect acid fumes from the mixed acid plant and the stacks.\n\t\n\tThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in 1982.\n\t\n\t\n\tFive Year Accident History\n\t\n\tNo incident resulting in offsite impacts or onsite injuries from an oleum or a nitric acid release has occurred at the Wilmington Facility within the last"
