Fuller Company\u00c2\u00bfs Roseville plant, are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Our various accidental release prevention programs covering areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility demonstrate our commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances as well as adhere to all applicable federal and state regulations.\n\n2.0\tThe stationary source and the regulated substance handled\nThe facility\u00c2\u00bfs primary activity involves the polymerization of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) and the formulation of several water-based adhesives.  VAM is a key ingredient in the production of our adhesive, and it is also a Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA) Section 112\u00c2\u00ae regulated substance.  VAM is received mainly by railcar transport and sometimes by truck, and stored in one storage tank.  The raw material is subsequently metered through a series of pipes and pumps, and is ultimately polymerized in the manufacturing process.  The resulting water-based emulsions are then combined with other chemicals in vessels such as reactors and mixing tanks to produce the finished adhesive product.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  Visitors are escorted while touring the plant.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tThe regulated substance handled at this manufacturing facility is Vinyl Acetate Monomer;\n\u00c2\u00b7\tThe maximum amount of VAM stored in a single vessel at this plant is 234,000 pounds\n\n3.0\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nWorst Case Scenario\nIn determining the worst case scenario, EPA's RMP*Comp was used to determine both the release rate and the dis"

The analysis assumed catastrophic failure of the VAM storage tank when filled to capacity (i.e., 30,000 gallons) resulting in a release of 234,000 pounds.  RMP*Comp show that an accidental release of this magnitude would have an off-site impact with distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles.\n\nPassive mitigation measures currently installed to minimize the off-site impact include a large secondary containment area partially enclosed with a roof.  A series of tall dikes and sumps limit the exposed surface area of pooled liquid in the event of an accidental spill.  These passive mitigation measures reduce the release rate in the event of tank failure to 44 pounds per minute.  This rate represents a continuous unabated release period of over 88 hours in order for the entire 234,000 pounds to evaporate.  In our opinion, this is an unlikely event.\n\nIn addition to the secondary containment already mentioned above, the VAM storage tank area has a foam fire protection system installed in the roof above the tanks.  The foam deluge system uses both ultraviolet and infrared detectors to monitor the tank storage area.  The tank farm is in a concrete pit below grade level to moderate the storage temperature and minimize tank-breathing losses.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario\nThe alternative scenario assumed a mixing vessel overfilled beyond its capacity with VAM.  This alternate case presupposed maximum pump discharge rate for 30 minutes without interruption.  This specific example results in an estimated distance to the toxic endpoint of less than .1 miles and a release rate to the outside air of less than 5-6 pound per minute.  The resulting exposures and impacts generated by EPA's RMP*Comp showed minimal impact to the neighboring community.\n\nActive mitigation measures such as audible and visual high level alarms (set at different capacities) are installed in the equipment to minimize the possibility of overfilling the mixing vessels.  \n\n4.0\tThe general accidental rel"

The adhesive manufacturing process utilizing VAM is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is also subject to EPCRA section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the current elements of the release prevention program in effect for the VAM polymerization process.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe facility maintains records on safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\nThe facility conducts safety studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The technique used to carry out these analyses is the HAZOP methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of facility personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations, and are revalidated whenever necessary.  All findings related to the hazard analysis are being addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, the Roseville plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, sequence of raw material additions, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nThe plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in operating procedures associated with the VAM utilizing process.  Refresher training or operational evaluations are provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanic"

Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations.  These employees are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the Roseville plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly informed and retrained if necessary.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at the Roseville plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP and PSM rules are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years, and any corrective actions required are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Roseville plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in a reportable release of VAM.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any correction actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
