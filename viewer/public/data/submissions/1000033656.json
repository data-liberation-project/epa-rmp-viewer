      "SummaryText": "DENCO II, LLC began ownership and operation of a fuel ethanol production plant located in Morris, Stevens County, Minnesota in September 2010.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, DENCO II, LLC maintains a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds for a flammable mixture (isopentane, pentane, and butane) and 20,000 pounds for aqueous ammonia. This RMP resubmission includes the removal of anhydrous ammonia (it's no longer stored or used at the facility).  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nDENCO II, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically aqueous ammonia and isopentane, pentane, and butane as constituents of the natural gasoline used as denaturant.  The aqueous ammonia is used as a nutrient source for yeast and pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of DENCO II, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of DENCO II, LLC to notify the Morris Fire Department, and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for nutrients and pH control.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will be approximately 62,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 30 percent"

      "SummaryText": "isopentane, 30 percent pentane, and 5 percent butane, all of which are RMP regulated flammable substances.   The natural gasoline is stored in one aboveground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  Due to the varying nature of the denaturant and consistent with RMP guidance documents, the entire denaturant mixture is modeled as a flammable substance based on the major regulated constituent with the highest heat of combustion (isopentane).  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be approximately 220,000 pounds.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and is likely to contain less regulated constituents and has lower volatility, reducing the potential release rate. An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. DENCO II, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThrough the completion of this RMP, DENCO II, LLC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nDENCO II, LLC does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nDENCO II, LLC has developed response efforts to a variety of potential scenarios involving hazardous substances stored an"

Facility staff receive regular RMP training which includes review of emergency response procedures. \r\n\r\nPlanned Change to Improve Safety\r\nAs previously mentioned, DENCO II, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. DENCO II, LLC management is committed to promoting a safe work environment. DENCO II, LLC will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support needed to conduct their work safely and to operate the ethanol production process in a safe and efficient manner."
