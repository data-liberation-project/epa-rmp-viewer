      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHanover Foods is commited to the safe operation of our facility.  This commitment is demonstrated by the signjficant use of resources expended in process control equipment, employee training, and management oversight.  Hanover Foods uses a written safety policy that outlines our concern and commitment to safety.\n\nFacility Descriptionand Regulated Substance Handled \n\nHanover Foods is a diverse processor of fresh, frozen and canned food products.  The Clayton, Delaware facility, the subject of this RMP, processes frozen foods only.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant due to its unique properties.  The ammonia refrigeration system consists of a main receiver, six freezers, three cold storage units, two chiller rooms, and associated piping and process control equipment.  The maximum amount of ammonia in the system at any time is 71,000 pounds.   Ammonia is the only EPA RMP regulated substance exceeding the threshold quantity at the site.  The ammonia refrigeration system falls under Prevention Program 3 of the RMP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is the catastrophic release of 18,000 pounds of ammonia from the main receiver, which is the largest vessel in the system.  In accordance with the RMP regulation, the release was modeled over a 10-minute period with no mitigating factors.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L would reach off-site receptors.  EPA's model, RMP*Comp, was used in calculating the extent of the release.  \n\nBecause the probability of the worst-case release scenario is minute, EPA allows calculation of an alternative release scenario.  Hanover Food's alternate release scenario, although unlikely to occur, has a greater chance of occuring than the worst-case release.  Hanover Food's alternative release scenario is a hose leak on the liquid side of the automerio, which is a freezer.  Ammonia would be released at an estimat"

The room in which the automerio is located is staffed at all times, and the leak could be stopped within 3.5 minutes.  This provides an active mitigating factor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint would not reach an off-site receptor.  RMP*Comp was used in calculating the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHanover Foods understands the risks of using ammonia, and has several active programs in place to mitigate any potential problems.  We are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management and utilize the 12 elements, including process hazards analysis, standard operating procedures, and employee training, to manage our system.  All changes are reviewed by our management of change system, and process hazard reviews are conducted before being placed into operation.  This facility is staffed by qualified refrigeration personnel 24 hours a day for 365 days a year.  \n\nHanover Foods has three ammonia detection monitors placed throughout the refrigeration system.  The monitors are set to alarm if an ammonia leak is detected.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nHanover Foods has had no ammonia releases in the past five years that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHanover Foods maintains a written emergency response plan that includes evacuation procedures, emergency coodinator responsibilities, notification procedures, and emergency medical procedures.  We have a fully staffed and trained emergency response team that would respond to an ammonia emergency at the site.  Our team receives annual training on emergency response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHanover Foods provides ongoing traini"
