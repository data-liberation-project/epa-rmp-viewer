WFS is NOT involved in the conversion process.  The contractor has provided WFS with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program, written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program are in place for this process.  Additionally, WFS-Easton has their own Emergency Action Plan, Incident Response Plan and other safety procedures and policies in place, including those required by the EPA under this Program.  The contractor reports that the following safeties to the process are in place:  an audible and visual alarm system will warn if pump or over-pressurization of equipment occurs.  Fisher N-550 ESV's are installed at discharge of source and at ammonia pump, and pneumatically held open during use, are capable of remote closure.  The ammonia hose used between source and pump, as well as that used for bypass, is FMH-22 double-braided, corrugated 316L SS to avoid potential rupture between these critical connections.  A standard Fisher pressure regulator is used at the pump, pressure controlled, to bypass any excess ammonia to the suction side of the pump.  A standard ammonia backcheck valve is used on the input line at the Mix Unit to prevent ammonia loss in case of hose rupture.  Pressure relief valves for the ammonia system are recertified annually by an outside vendor retained by the contractor.  These added safeties have proven effective in avoiding potential releases for the contractor as evidenced by the contractor's safety record. ",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\n\n\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Watonwan Farm Service, Easton, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage 0f fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  WFS-Easton also periodically retains an OUTSIDE contractor who utilizes a mobile unit for the purpose of blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid to produce a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer, 10-34-00.  WFS is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does WFS own the conversion equipment.   \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately 170,000 pounds in our two 18,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 160,000 pounds available capacity in various 1,450 and 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis facility is not constantly manned every work day.  There are approximately 14 employees who may work on the site periodically throughout the year.  The best estimation of full-time equivalency would be 1-2 employees. \n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 C"
