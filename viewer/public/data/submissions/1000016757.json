The Facility Policy\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA West Liquid Plant in Centralia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Boone County Fire Protection District, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of liquid and dry bulk fertilizers, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.\n\nProduct will typically be delivered by tanker trucks that hold 50,000 pounds, but might be delivered by railroad tank car. The facility has two 30,000-gallon storage tanks, seventy-six, 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and two 560-gallon tank applicators for product distribution and application.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to maintain the newest codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from a parked nurse tank on August 15, 2010 at approximately 10:09 a.m. There was a release of approximately 4,200 pounds to the air due to the attempted theft of product believed for production of methamphetamine. There were no injuries on or off-site and minor vegetation damage both on-site and off-site. There was no "
