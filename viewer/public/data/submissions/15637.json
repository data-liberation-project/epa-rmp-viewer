If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or otherr authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the relaese to people and the environment.\nFacility Information.\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n     Anhhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 85,000 pounds in our two 10,000 gallon storage tanks.     \nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n     The worst-case scenario would be the relase of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity relseased would be 44,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n     The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potentiaal incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to tthe endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .85 miles\nThe accidental release prevention program\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The Americaan National Standaards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 cfr 1910.111, \" Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\nThe Five-year Accident History\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in"
