The site has a plan to upgrade the dry unloading system and components as well.\n\nHomestead Terminal has also implemented a Potential Serious Injury and Fatality (PSIF) program. This program focuses on routine tasks and hazards that have the potential to cause a life altering injury. The site routinely conducts PSIF audits across the facility.

A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near Agrium's process.  This permit ensures that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to hot work operations.\n\nD.   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Homestead Terminal has an Emergency Response Program (ERP) in place to respond to releases of hazardous material at the site.  All employees are instructed via the ERP and training on their responsibilities in case of a release.\n\nThe site works closely with the LEPC and the local fire department in responding to emergencies.  The local fire department tours the site at least once per year to determine what hazardous materials are present, the location of the materials, and the best responding procedures.  The site also keeps the LEPC and the local fire department informed of any new hazardous materials that are introduced into the workplace.  The other outside agencies that will be involved in responding to emergencies at the site include the County Sheriff, Highway Patrol, Beatrice Fire Department and outside contractors that are needed for such operations as containment, cleanup, material handling, etc.\n\nAll reportable releases of hazardous material will be reported immediately to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, State Emergency Response Commission and the National Response Center.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nProcess hazard analysis (PHAs), incident investigation, management of change, and compliance audits are conducted regularly at the Homestead Terminal to identify potential hazards, learn from mistakes, and verify design and maintain compliance.

The MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place:\n-authorization requirement for the change\n-technical basis for the proposed change\n-impact of the change on health and safety\n\nAfter the changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees, prior to the startup of the modified process.  In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\nWhen a change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, the site will conduct a PSR.  The PSR team leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSR.  All PSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\nContractors\nNutrien has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.  It is Agrium's policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safety work practices related to contractors and periodically evaulate contractors.\n\nNutrien will inform contractors of any known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractors work and the process.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Nutrien U.S. LLC Homestead Terminal near Beatrice, Nebraska transfers anhydrous ammonia from ammonia railcars and trucks into aboveground storage tanks (AST's) at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is subsequently loaded on to trucks for distribution to retail agricultural centers. The site receives feed grade products and othe dry fertilizers by both truck and rail and are offloaded into storage warehouses. These products are then loaded on to trucks for distribution.\n\nB.   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years, there have been zero RMP reportable ammonia releases at the Nutrien Homestead Terminal.\n\nC.   ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Homestead Terminal has a Release Prevention Program (RPP) in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at the facility.  This RPP includes:\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThis facility has developed and is keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process.  All employees are trained in the area where they perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the process areas is allowed.  The PSI will enable employees and contractors of Nutrien to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThis facility is committed to performing a PHA to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with processes at the site.  The PHA is used to analyze potential mishaps, identify mishaps that could occur, analyze the likelihood that mishaps will occur, evaluate the consequence of these mishaps, and analyze the likelihood that safety systems, mititgation systems and emergency systems will function properly to eliminate or reduce the consequences of a mishap.\n\nThe PHA will be revalidated at least every five years to assure the PHA is consistent with the current process."
