The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance will be formally established with the Tolleson Fire Department, including the Maricopa County HazMat Team. The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\r\n\r\nAll Atlas personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills will be held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\r\n\r\nThis plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Atlas Lead Refrigeration Technician.\r\n\r\n1.70 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time.\r\n\r\nAtlas identified recommendations to improve safety during the most recent compliance audit in February, 2011. These recommendations are scheduled to be completed by June, 2013."

      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Atlas Logistics Retail Services LLC (Atlas) produce facility refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Atlas to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1919.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120. The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\r\n\r\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\r\n\r\n- Atlas stores and distributes refrigerated and non-refrigerated foods. Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the product integrity. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\n- The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. \r\n\r\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 in"
