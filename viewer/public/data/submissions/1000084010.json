Excess CO2 is removed via the amine system, A302dried and then to a HYCO Cold Box for partial oxidation and cryogenic separation and purification of CO.  The Hydrogen from the Cold Box is delivered to the Pressure Swing Adsorption Unit where it is further purified, compressed and sent to the customer.  The CO from the Cold Box is compressed and sent to the customer.  The plant will start in 2020 and is subject to 29 CFR1919.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n\"Regulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA.

Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.                            \n\n\"Prevention Program:\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the SSU, Geismar, LA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention progra"

This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of PSI (Process Safety Information), describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity.\n\n- Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review.\n\n\n\nLinde has an employee participation program that promotes involvement in the process safety program and helps ensure understanding of facility-specific elements of the safety program.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\n\n\n\"Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant. They are maintained monthly and undergo yearly inspections by an outside vendor.\n\n- Plant operation emergency shutdowns (if process variable is exceeded) will shutdown the Plant and isolate the process.  This location has multiple plant emergency trips located throughout the facility.\n\n-During plant emergency alarm conditions, this facility contacts BASF first responders.                            \n\n                            \n\n\"Five-year Accident History:                            \n\nThis is a new facility to begin operation in 2020.                             \n\n                            \n\n\"Emergency Response Programs:    "
