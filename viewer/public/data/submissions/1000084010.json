Excess CO2 is removed via the amine system, A302dried and then to a HYCO Cold Box for partial oxidation and cryogenic separation and purification of CO.  The Hydrogen from the Cold Box is delivered to the Pressure Swing Adsorption Unit where it is further purified, compressed and sent to the customer.  The CO from the Cold Box is compressed and sent to the customer.  The plant will start in 2020 and is subject to 29 CFR1919.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n\"Regulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA.

Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\n\n\n\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.                            \n\n\"Prevention Program:\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the SSU, Geismar, LA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention progra"
