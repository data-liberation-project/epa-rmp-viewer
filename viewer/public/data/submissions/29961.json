Vernon Ave., Vernon, CA 90085, AmeriCold Logistics, LLC implemented the government programs; Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Planning (RMP). AmeriCold Logistics will manage and operate the facility.\n\nThe PSM program was audited for completeness, deficiencies were noted and a program was installed to manage the timely  mitigation of deficiency items and plans to improve safety.  Being that this is a new facility these deficiencies issues were few.  Most consisted of contractor \"punch list\" Items that will be completed prior to start up.\n\nUpon completion of the PSM, the RMP program was completed.  The RMP team (David Hay, Wayne Isaac, Tom Kelley, and Mike Elliott who are all knowledgeable in the process) found the construction of the facility and the conventional ammonia refrigeration system to be very sound and safe.  The Process Hazard Analysis was found to be in good order.  The 13 elements of the PSM program were reviewed and found to be in good order.  The facility emergency response program and plan was reviewed and found to be in good order."
