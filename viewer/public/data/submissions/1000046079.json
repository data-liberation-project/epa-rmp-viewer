It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at on of our plants.\n\n\n\nPrimary Activity\n\nThe primary activity at the Dowling Road Pump Station is municipal water disinfection and distribution.\n\n\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant prior to distribution in the drinking water supply.\n\n\n\nQuantity Handled or Stored\n\nChlorine: 24,000 pounds\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Dowling Road Pump Station area is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68.  The staff has conducted a comprehensive review of all Facility systems, as well as administrative, technical, operation, and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the rule.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Dowling Road Pump Station has never had a significant release of a hazardous substance as defined by this Rule.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an Emergency Response Program that is coordinated with the community plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEvents that will continue to improve safety at the facility are:\n\n*  Water Production employees are issued updated operating procedures and are trained using the procedures.\n\n*  Emergency Response Procedures are reviewed and revised as appropriate.\n\n*  Finalize the installation of a work order system to better track maintenance performed."
