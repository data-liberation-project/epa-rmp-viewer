      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Evangeline Power Station (EPS) has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The CLECO Evangeline L.L.C. policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. operates the EPS located in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana.  The EPS is a gas fired stream electric plant that produces approximately 330 megawatts of electricity during peak demand periods.  EPS proposed to construct three combustion turbines fired by natural gas.  The heat recovered by heat exchangers is used to turn electric generating units producing electricity for sale to homes and businesses.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accident Release Program (ARP), the EPS is a Program 3 process.\n\nThe EPS was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were or would be present in the planned process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  The three separate generating units and associated ammonia tanks are separate of each other.  Therefore, for ARP Program purposes, these processes were considered separately.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. identified one regulated toxic substance and no flammable substances above the threshold values at EPS.  Three bullet tanks with a capacity of 10,000 gallons each, containing anhydrous ammonia were determined to exceed the threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceedance indicates that the EPS is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to threshold "

A WCS analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process while only one WCS analysis is required for regulated flammable substances as a class.  WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an ambient air temperature of 25 degrees C, 77 degrees F.  Topography for WCSs is distinguished between rural and urban.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. did not find any flammable substances above threshold quantities at EPS.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. identified anhydrous ammonia, a toxic gas, as being present in quantities in excess of threshold quantities.  Toxic gasses include all regulated toxic substances that are gases at ambient temperature (temperature 25 degrees C, 77 degrees F), even if they are stored as liquids under pressure or refrigeration.  For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.  For toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released for the pipeline is assumed to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids.  The endpoint for air dispersion modeling to estimate the consequence distance for a release of a toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid"

Although the three anhydrous ammonia tanks are not located such that a release from one tank would cause the release of anhydrous ammonia from one of the other tanks, the three tanks are considered to be part of one process.  Consequently only one worst case toxic release has been included in this RMP.  For the purpose of identifying the maximum release quantity for use in determining potential off-site impacts, it is assumed that the entire contents of one of the three anhydrous ammonia vessels is released to the atmosphere forming a vapor cloud.  Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this release represents the facility's worst-case scenario for toxic gas and liquids.  Using administrative controls, only 46,327 pounds of anhydrous ammonia will be stored in each tank.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of a 10-minute release of 46,327 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was determined to be 4.0 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nAn ARS describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those cited for a WCS.  One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a Program 2 or 3 process that exceeds threshold quantity while only one ARS analysis is required for all flammable substances as a class.  For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n\nAlternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fenceline.  Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\n\nEPS Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammables\n\nNo flammable s"

A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has identified for the anhydrous ammonia  tanks.  Seal failure on the anhydrous ammonia tanks causes a release from a one-inch opening at a pressure of 145 psia and a temperature of 77 degrees F, (298 degrees K).  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.  It was determined that a release lasting ten minutes would involve 1,176 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and would reach its toxic end point at 0.20 miles from the vessel.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe EPS has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nThe EPS as coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required n 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCLECO Evangeline, L.L.C. and the EPS actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.  This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.

This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe EPS has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe EPS uses a combination of what if/checklist and a hazard and operatibility (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  These methods use a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically "

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe EPS maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the EPS has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operations demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe EPS issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.

The plan outlines actions that company technicians and contract employees are to take when there is an unwanted release of highly hazardous chemicals.  The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the EPS periodically conducted an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.  The audit team develops findings and corrective actions are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained."
