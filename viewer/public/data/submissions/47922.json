If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Shawnee Township Fire Department, (distance from terminat is 0.5 miles) as well as the Allen County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services (Shawnee Township) and St. Rita's Hospital.  This facility maintains a incipient stage fire extinguisher) trained personnel and hazardous materials response team (Technicial Level) to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Buckeye Terminals, LLC., - Lima South Terminal is a bulk gasoline (kerosene/deisel) storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two 87,659 gallon storage tanks.  The facility's worst case scenario is the failure of one of the system's two 87,569 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.6miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely with greatest amount released) release scenario is a \"pull away\" accident resulting in one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but does not affect residential areas.  The Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Lima South Terminal complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), a"
