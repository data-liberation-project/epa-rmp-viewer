The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has many elements including hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs. An RMP is required when facilities use EPA specified chemicals at quantities within the defined criteria. The RMP substances handled at the facility are formaldehyde, methyl formate, hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen flouride, and titanium tetrachloride.  Ticona Polymers, Inc., Bishop facility has two on-site partners, OXEA BISHOP LLC and BASF.  OXEA owns and operates the assets located at the Bishop facility and prepares and submits its own RMP.  BASF owns the assets located at the Bishop facility, however is operated by Ticona employees.  Ticona incorporates RMP substances for BASF under the Ticona RMP.\n\n\n\nThe information submitted in the RMP includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical descriptions, five year accidental history, which is zero, alternate release scenario and the worst case scenario. The RMP requires covered facilities to develop a worst case scenario for a release of covered chemicals from a site as well as a more realistic release scenario (alternate release scenarios). The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community awareness, prevention and emergency response planning, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely case scenario would ever occur. These scenarios are estimates required by EPA and are used to illustrate the importance of risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency prepa"

The Onsite Emergency response team is well trained and equipped to respond to an emergency.  \n\n\n\nThe Bishop facility has an excellent safety record and is recognized as the Best in the State of Texas in Safety by the Texas Chemical Council. Since 2012, our world-class OHSA incident rate of 0.0 is significantly better than the national average for our industry. Our 5 year accidental release history has not resulted in any RMP incidents.\n\n\n\nBrief History  \n\n\n\nThe Bishop plant started operating in 1945 to produce chemicals needed to support the U.S. in World War II. Covering approximately 1400 acres in southwest Nueces County, the plant produces engineering plastics, organic chemicals, and pharmaceuticals products. The plant operates around the clock, seven days a week.. Approximately 330 full-time employees and around 300 contract employees work at the Bishop Facility.\n\n\n\nLocal Expenditures\n\n\n\n-Annual payroll is more than $ 50 million\n\n-Annual purchases, many made within 50 miles, exceed $ 12 million\n\n-Annual school and property taxes is more than $ 6 million\n\n\n\nPrimary Business Activity\n\n\n\nThe Bishop Plant produces approximately 1.5 billion pounds of product each year.
