      "SummaryText": "Brentwood Processing and Distribution Center (P&DC) will be fumigated with gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) to deactivate detected anthrax spores within the building.  The process will include:\n\n? On-site aqueous ClO2 generation system\n? ClO2 delivery system consisting of gas emitters located within the building\n? Exhaust system with scrubbers to maintain a negative pressure within the building\n? Scrubbing liquid delivery systems. \n\nThe ClO2 fumigation system is expected to go on operation in July 2002 and will be operated only for the purpose mentioned above. After fumigation, ClO2 will be removed from the building, and the systems will be dismantled.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is prepared because the total quantity of ClO2 in the system is expected to exceed the threshold quantity.  The RMPlan is specifically for the ClO2 fumigation process because no other process in the facility handles or stores any listed chemical above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) was developed based on gaseous release of all ClO2 within the building during fumigation.  The emission of ClO2 was calculated based on an average concentration of 750 ppmv within the building.  The resulting impact distance was 4.4 miles.  The impact distance is defined as the distance to the toxic endpoint mentioned in the RMP (1 ppmv).  The alternative scenario was based on a hazard review of the process and involved failure of the scrubbing liquid of the exhaust air systems, resulting in a release of ClO2 for a period of 15 minutes. The resulting impact distance was 0.16 miles for the same toxic endpoint.  In both cases, the impacts extend outside the facility property line.\n\nThe fumigation process is covered by OSHA PSM regulations, since the total estimated quantity of ClO2 will exceed the OSHA PSM threshold quantity of 1000 lbs.  Therefore, this process was considered as Program Level 3 per Risk Management Program guidelines. Prevention program elements listed in this RMPlan ref"

As many of the elements of the prevention program (i.e. equipment testing, training program, maintenance program, and emergency response plan) are in various stages of preparation (subject to finalization of engineering design), the dates mentioned in the RMPlan for some of the prevention program elements reflect estimated future completion dates.  However, all elements of the prevention program will be in place prior to operation of the fumigation process. \n\nThe ClO2 fumigation will be conducted by contractors.  The date of the most recent review of the employee participation plan (item 7.12) refers to the appropriate contractor employees.\n\nIn addition to the prevention program, extensive safety measures and procedures will be implemented during the period that ClO2 will be on site.  These measures and procedures include, but are not limited to: i.) a network of ambient and in-building monitoring;  ii.) development of corrective action plans; iii.) testing of all equipment; and iv.) a well-defined command structure in place."
