Executive Summary\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Four Star Fruit has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Four Star Fruit, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Four Star Fruit has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name         Process Chemical         Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nWest Process         Anhydrous Ammonia        42,000\r\nEast Process         Anhydrous Ammonia        20,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM pla"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\r\n1.2 Process Descriptions\r\n\r\nFour Star Fruit, Inc. operates a commercial cold storage for table grapes. The facility has two ammonia systems (East & West). The systems are completely independent from each other. The West System provides refrigerating capacity to six precool rooms equipped with forced air cooling and eleven cold storage rooms for palleted product. The East System provides refrigerating capacity to two precool rooms equipped with forced air cooling.\r\n \r\nThe systems operate as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receivers is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room, where it passes through a compressor. The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to a water cooled condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied, and returned to our one of our high pressure receivers.\r\n \r\nThe West System was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with standard design and installation practices of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems It has been modified a few times since the original installation, the most recent being the addition of a refrigerated packaging room in 2010. The East System was built in 2009 by Indust"

      "SummaryText": "rial Refrigeration Services, Inc.  Power-It Solutions did a major renovation of the computer control controls for the East and West Systems in 2010.  Both systems were built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction.\r\n \r\nThe systems contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. Lastly, each system has an emergency \"dump box\" containing switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary. The ammonia systems at our facility consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating each system as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nFour Star Fruit has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Four Star Fruit facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this"

Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\r\n  \r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nFour Star Fruit has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nFour Star Fruit's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nFour Star Fruit has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Four Star Fruit continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Four Star Fruit's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Four Star Fruit's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nFour S"

      "SummaryText": "tar Fruit has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Four Star Fruit has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Four Star Fruit now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Four Star Fruit employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Four Star Fruit will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
