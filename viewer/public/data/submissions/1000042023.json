Three process areas at the facility contain regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantities listed in Table 1 in Sec. 68.130.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release scenarios have been modeled for the three processes using TRACE (Toxic Release Analysis of Chemical Emissions; Version 10.1) chemical release modeling software, a commercially available product from SAFER Systems, LLC.  There have been modifications to the number of RMP covered processes and the release scenarios since the last filing.  Most notably the elimination of one of the RMP covered processes previously (Process ID # 1000011031) identified in the 2009 WSTF Risk Management Plan and a renaming of the remaining processes to more accurately describe the WSTF process.  These modifications will be discussed in subsequent sections of the RMP.\r\n\r\nAll scenarios were modeled using Subpart B input requirements.  There are no regulated flammable substances at WSTF present in quantities above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 WSTF DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nWSTF was established in 1962 to support certification of Apollo spacecraft propulsion and power systems and association subsystems for the Manned Space Center, now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC).  From the late 1970s to 2011, WSTF was heavily involved in the development, qualification and acceptance testing of the Space Shuttle attitude and orbital control bipropellant propulsion systems.  In the late 1990s, WSTF was also requested to perform testing of the Space Shuttle Auxiliary Power Units (APU) that utilized hydrazine as a monopropellant.  Specific propulsion systems include the Orbital Maneu"

In accordance with 40 CFR 68.190(b)(5) & (6), NASA will submit to EPA an updated Risk Management Plan within 6 months of this new propellant storage approach, since the current Process Hazard Analysis will need to be revised, and a revised offsite consequence analysis will be required.\r\n\r\nAs a prelude to the new propellant (MMH) storage configuration, WSTF procured a liquid propellant tanker which was designed to transport (on-site only), receive, offload, and store hypergolic fuels, such as MMH. The LT88 Fuel Tanker, consists of a dual-wheel, tandem axle, frameless chassis assembly, on which is mounted a 2,760 gallon liquid storage tank (2500-gal payload with 10 percent ullage) encapsulated in a protective jacket. It is also equipped with the associated fill and discharge piping and controls. The inner vessel is an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) lethal service pressure vessel with a certifying U-stamp. The inner vessel is constructed entirely of 304L stainless steel. \r\n\r\nThe outer vessel (jacket) completely surrounds and encapsulates the inner vessel. It is designed to be charged with a dry nitrogen blanket or a full vacuum to prevent corrosion of the inner vessel.\r\n\r\nThe inner surface of the outer jacket is coated with an intumescent coating. This coating is an epoxy paint that is fire retardant and demonstrates insulating properties when exposed to extreme heat or flame. The tanker has been designed to meet the requirements of t"

WSTF has chartered an Emergency Preparedness Planning Board which has the responsibility to continuously review the plan and assure its effective maintenance. \r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\tWSTF FACILITIES REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nSeveral hazardous chemicals are essential in testing propulsion systems at WSTF.  The EPA regulates one of these chemicals that WSTF possesses in an amount over the threshold quantity, the propellant monomethyl hydrazine (MMH).  This propellant is used in several NASA, Department of Defense, and commercial aerospace propulsion subsystems.  As identified in Section 2.0, WSTF Description and Background, WSTF completed the decommissioning of all Shuttle Program assets in 2012.  For 2014 and the foreseeable future there are no hydrazine testing requirements.  With the reduced testing schedule, specifically with hydrazine, WSTF has reduced the hydrazine quantities currently stored in the 300 Area to levels below the RMP threshold quantity and the 300 Area Hydrazine Storage and Distribution System (Process ID # 1000011031 in previous WSTF RMPs) is no longer a RMP covered process.  \r\n\r\nThe hypergolic propellant MMH is used for engine testing and is contained in storage and run tanks. It is the only hypergolic propellant present at WSTF in quantities which exceed the Risk Management Program rule threshold quantity for the identified regulated substances.  Storage containers (tanks, drums, cylinders, etc) are present in the 300, 400 and 500 Areas and are stored at ambient temperature and pressures up to 60-80 psig. Dump Tanks are used to receive propellant from run tanks not consumed during an engine test or as an emergency dump location as needed.  Propellant in dump tanks is typically transferred back to run tanks or to longer term storage tanks, but can be stored in the dump tanks as well. Run tanks are present at the point of use and are used to store"

WSTF's ISO 9001 registered management system establishes a strong basis for conformance to NASA policies and procedures and compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nWSTF's efforts to prevent accidental releases in the future begin with lessons learned from the past.  WSTF has been conducting hazardous testing with liquid rocket propellants since the early 1960's.  Our research and test experience have helped define hypergolic propellant hazards for the aerospace industry.  Awareness of hazards is the first step in being able to design, build, operate and maintain safe, reliable systems.  And designing, building, operating and maintaining safe, reliable systems is the key to preventing accidental releases.  Prevention starts with good engineering practice.  \r\n\r\nThe primary accidental release prevention measures are the primary engineering controls mentioned above - design, build up and operation.  Each type of control has one or more management system documents dedicated to its implementation.  These controls are integral to WSTF's Process Safety Management instruction (WSI 25-SW-0005, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) which is based on 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and addresses each of the PSM elements.\r\n\r\nWSTF's Pressure Systems Program, which is based on ASME code and other relevant national consensus standards, is of paramount importance in establishing, implementing, and verifying mechanical integrity design standards.\r\n\r\nWSTF procedure WSP 25-0009, WSTF Emergency Preparedness Plan, provides directions for activities which: eliminate or reduce the probability of disaster; prepare measures which protect life, the environment, and property; respond appropriately during emergenci"

Propellant was supplied to the propulsion test stands through propellant distributions systems.  In previous WSTF Risk Management Plans, the bulk storage tanks within these distribution systems comprised WSTF's RMP covered processes, with an additional process being a drum storage area.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Space Shuttle Program in 2010, WSTF was required to return the 7 Space Shuttle dedicated test stands to a test stand neutral condition or mothball state.  WSTF completed the decommissioning of all Shuttle Program assets in 2012.  For 2014 and the foreseeable future there are no hydrazine testing requirements and only 4 of the original 9 test stands will be used to support propulsion testing.  With the reduced testing schedule, specifically with hydrazine, WSTF has reduced the hydrazine quantities currently stored in the 300 Area to levels below the RMP threshold quantity and the 300 Area Hydrazine Storage and Distribution System is no longer a RMP covered process.  There are three remaining RMP covered processes that will be described in Section 4.0, WSTF Facilities Regulated Substances.\r\n\r\nWSTF remains a facility operated under the direction of JSC.  The mission of WSTF is to provide the expertise and infrastructure to test and evaluate spacecraft materials, components, and propulsion systems to enable the safe human exploration and utilization of space.

While a forklift is loading the 55-gallon drum of MMH onto the transport trailer, there is an accident (another forklift collides with the forklift transporting the drum) that causes the drum to be physically dropped off the transport vehicle, resulting in a rupture of the drum and a release from the 55-gallon drum.  Since a continuous release toxic model was selected, the inputs used were a release rate of 25 pounds per minute and a release duration of 15 minutes.  The response by the on-site Fire Department was estimated to be 15 minutes, which includes curtailment of the release from the drum.  \r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is a liquid release of 100 % MMH, which is identified as a toxic liquid.   The postulated release resulted in 51.13 gallons (375 lbs) of MMH being released at ground level onto an unconfined soil area (not diked).  Upon release of the MMH onto the unconfined soil area, there was subsequent vaporization of MMH into the air.\r\n\r\nMeteorological conditions used for the Alternative Release scenario were those selected as representative based on data from the WSTF Facility Master Plan."
