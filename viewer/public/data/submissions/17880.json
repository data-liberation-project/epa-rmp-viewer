If an accident or spill should occur, the facility is prepared to work\nwith the local fire department, police, ambulance and emergency planning committees or\nother authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and environment.\n\n2.The primary activity of the NH3 facility is to retail anhydrous ammonia to patrons in the elevator trade area for agricultural production. The maximum storage capacity includes a\n30,000-gallon tank approved for NH3 use. It is filled to a maximum of 88% capacity or about 68 tons of NH3. It is filled by tanker trucks in the use season. Each tanker holds 17-24 ton. In addition the facility owns 8 more tanks, each holding 3.375 tons and 20 smaller tanks each holding 2.25 tons. These units are rented to growers for anhydrous ammonia application.\n\n3. The worst case release scenarios and the alternative release scenario:\n\n    A.    The worst case release scenarios would be the release of the total contents of\nstorage tank as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be about 136,000 pounds assuming a full tank complete valve failure and excess flow valve failure. The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is about 2 1/2 miles.\n\n    B.    The alternation release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a tanker transfer hose releasing about 20 ton. This again assuming complete valve failure and back-up safety equipment fails. The distance to end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\n    C.    Another alternative release would be a filling hose rupture on a nurse tank.\nPotential full release of 2.25 tons.\n\n    4.    The Acciden"

The Five-Year Accident History:\n\n    A.    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyear that have caused any death, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n    B.    The following is a list of accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyears that have occurred at the facility:\n\nMay 7, 1999--about 100# release: A customer pulled away from the fill station with the hoses still hooked up. The pump was shut off prior to this. The hoses broke with the valve fully open. However, the excess flow valve in the tank closed immediately and the emergency shut-off valves on the loading riser closed when the cables pulled the releases. No injuries and the vapor dispersed without contact to anyone close to the facility.\n\n        6.    The Emergency Response Program: The facility has:\n\nA. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning community right to know information as required under Title 21 1 1 (EPCRA).\n\nC. Conducted annual pre-planning sessions with the local fire department and emergency personnel in the unlikelihood of a major release accident.\n\nD. Conducted annual training for employees involved in the facility to the safe operation of the equipment and emergency response.\n\n        7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Regular maintenance and updating of equipment are an essential "
