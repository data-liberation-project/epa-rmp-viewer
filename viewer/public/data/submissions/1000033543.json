Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nThe Klamath Cogeneration Project is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were to occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Klamath County Fire District No. 1 who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 102,900 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and the EPCRA 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findin"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nThe Klamath Cogeneration Project has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nThe Klamath Cogeneration Project completes highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by those checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel complete maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed to ensure their competency.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Klamath Cogeneration Project to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification of process operations, are promptly informed of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\n\n\nPre-sta"

These audits are completed at least every three years and any corrective actions identified during the audits are completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nThe Klamath Cogeneration Project promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or had the potential to result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are conducted to determine the cause of the  incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nThe Klamath Cogeneration Project believes that process safety management and incident investigation are a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning incident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our implementation of the RMP Regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\n\n\nThe Klamath Cogeneration Project hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed.
