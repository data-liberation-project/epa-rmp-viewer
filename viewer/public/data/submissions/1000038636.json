It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Dows Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the North Central Regional Planning District will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED \n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant"

At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is(12).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nFacility has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of the Company to immediately notify the local fire department and the North Central Regional Planning District to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Dows Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Dows location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Dows has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and North Central Regional Planning District. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the jo"

This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites  local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
