      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program Executive Summary\nThe Dow Chemical Company\nGrand Bayou Operations\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at The Dow Chemical Company-Grand Bayou Operations are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, we are coordinated with the Assumption Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Grand Bayou Operations primary activity includes the solution mining of salt from the Napoleonville Dome, which is located in Assumption Parish, encompassing a surface area of approximately 1670 acres.  Dow's operations on the Napoleonville Salt Dome began in 1957 with the drilling and mining of the Grace No. 1 well.  Since then, an additional 29 Dow operated caverns have been mined into the dome.  Fifteen of the active carverns are in hydrocarbon service with total storage capacity in excess of 38 million barrels.  Nine caverns are in mining service with a saturated brine deliverability of 8500 gallons per minute.  We have 8 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ethane, Butane, Pentane, Propylene  [1-Propene], Methane, Ethylene [Ethene], Propane and Chlorine. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Ethane at our facility is 180,000,000 lbs. while Butane, Pentane, Propylene  [1-Propene], Methane, Ethylene [Ethene], Propane and Chlorine are present at our facility in quantities of 37,000,000 lbs., 160,000,000 lbs., 64,000,000 lbs., 850,000 lbs., 120,000,000 lbs., 250,000,000 lbs., and 8000 l"

The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures \n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the modeling program PHAST.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves the release of 2000 lbs. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 2.0 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release.  In this scenario 1,500,000 lbs. of Pentane is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.9 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nAn additional worst case release scenario for Program 3 flammables, involving a catastrophic release, is also included in the RMP because it affects different offsite receptors.  In this scenario 1,500,000 lbs. of Propylene  [1-Propene] is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion"

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.9 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release of Propane.  The release is assumed to result in a Jet fire.  The scenario involves the release of 12,770 lbs. of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint is 0.04 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company-Grand Bayou Operations maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some of this documentation includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment spec sheets, and reactive chemicals tests.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the Dow Fire and Explosion Index, the Dow Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/23/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical "
