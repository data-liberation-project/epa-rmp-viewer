Cargill AgHorizons considers chemical safety a top priority.  Cargill's Process Hazard Analysis followed by Critical Task procedure training provides the training and the means to prevent chemical injury to both Cargill employees and the general public.  In the unlikely occurrence of a chemical release, Cargill's Emergency Action Plan would help minimize the impact on human health and the environment, and the damage to property.  The Emergency Action Plan incorporates the local fire department as emergency responders.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 30,000 gallon, one 18,000-gallon aboveground containers, and about (75) 780 gallon nurse tanks with the capacity to contain 697,800 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario.  The worst case toxic release scenario was evaluated using EPA's RMP COMP software (Ver. 1.06).  The scenario involves the release of 153,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied under pressure, which represents release of anhydrous ammonia in an amount equal to the maximum capacity of the container.  Default assumptions for the RMP COMP software were used: 77 degrees F, 3.4 MPH wind speed, and stability class F.  In addition, an urban setting was used (based on actual site conditions), and no mitigation measures were included.  The release duration was 10 minutes.  The toxic endpoint for this scenario is 4.4 miles (7.1 kilometers).   176 people reside within this distance from the anhydrous ammonia container.\n\nAlternative Scenario.  The alternative toxic release scenario was also evaluated"
