      "SummaryText": "1.  INTRODUCTION\n\nThe United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP).  The RMP is in accordance with the requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The PGDP plant is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP requirements. \n\n2.  MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION \n\nUSEC is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of the workers and the public, and protects the environment.  In order to meet these commitments, USEC has issued an operations policy manual which states, in part that it is:  \"committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the health and safety of workers and the public, protects the environment and provides for the common defense and security.  USEC has provided the management structure to ensure that the safety/safeguards policy is effectively implemented.\"  \n\n3.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n3.1  Facility Description and Location\n\nPGDP enriches uranium using the gaseous diffusion process.  PGDP is located at 37\u00c2\u00b0 6' 55\" N. latitude and 88\u00c2\u00b0 48' 34\" W. longitude measured at the approximate center of the plant, on a 3,423-acre tract in McCracken County, Kentucky. The site is generally in a rural area and was previously part of the Kentucky Ordnance Works.  PGDP occupies approximately 650 acres within the Controlled Access Area. Highway U.S. 60 is the closest major highway and intersects the plant access road 3 miles south of the plant. Interstate Highway 24 is to the east of the plant and intersects U.S. 60 near the present city limits of Paducah.  The north, east, and west boundaries of the plant are defined by the Kentucky Wildlife Management Game Reserve.  Adjoining the reserve on the north is the Tennessee Valley Authority's Shawnee Steam Plant which is located on the Ohio River. The entire PGDP facility is owned by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  \n\nUSEC leases and operates a portion of the PGDP plant."

      "SummaryText": "The leased portion contains more than 115 buildings and structures with a total floor space of about 8 million square feet.  Four large enrichment process buildings constitute approximately 75 percent of the plant's total floor space.  There are also cooling towers, electrical switchyards, and several support operations structures, including sewage and liquid effluent treatment plants, decontamination and recovery operations, coal and ash-handling facilities, water treatment facilities, steam plant, maintenance operations, laboratories, fluorine facilities, and air plants.  Buildings, facilities, and areas not leased by USEC are owned and operated by DOE.\n\nThis RMP applies only to facilities leased by USEC.\n\n3.2  Regulated Substances\n\nChlorine and fluorine are the only substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 which are present in quantities exceeding their respective threshold quantity.  Chlorine and fluorine are managed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 PSM program.\n\n3.3  Use of Regulated Substances\n\n3.3.1  Chlorine\n\nRaw water is taken from the Ohio River, treated and supplied to PGDP for numerous uses.  A portion of the water is filtered and post-disinfected, using chlorine, and used to supply potable water, fire system water, cooling water, and other uses.  Raw water treatment takes place at the C-611 Water Treatment Plant which is located to the west of the plant.  Chlorine is used at two locations at C-611.  \n\nA portion of the water treated at C-611 is provided to the recirculating cooling water (RCW) system.  This system provides cooling water to the enrichment process.  RCW is treated with chlorine, via chlorinators in four RCW pump houses (C-631, C-633, C-635, and C-637), to control the growth of microorganisms in the RCW system.   \n\nChlorine is also stored in 1-ton containers at the C-745-A storage yard.\n\n3.3.2  Fluorine\n\nFluorine is used as a fluorinating agent for conditioning new equipment surfaces prior to uranium hexafluoride exposure an"

      "SummaryText": "d may be used to dry equipment after exposure to wet air.  The fluorine system primarily consists of the C-410-K Fluorine Facility, the C-410-D Fluorine Storage Building, and the distribution piping, valves, and instrumentation.  Fluorine is purchased as a 20% fluorine/80% nitrogen molar mixture and it is delivered in DOT-approved multi-tube trailers.  A full DOT-approved trailer nominally contains 1800 lbs of fluorine at 2,000 psig that is distributed in eight separate tubes (i.e., nominally 225 lbs of fluorine per tube).  One nominally full and one nominally empty (i.e., heeled) multi-tube trailer may be stored in both the C-745-A and C-745-B storage yards.  When needed, a full multi-tube trailer is moved to C-410-K, where the gas pressure is reduced to defined levels and is then fed to the storage tanks or the pressure reducing manifolds in C-410-D.  The pressure of the gas mixture is further reduced at the C-410-D pressure reducing manifolds and then fed to the fluorine distribution header for distribution to other plant locations.  \n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no major releases of chlorine or fluorine involving injury to site workers, environmental effects, or any impact to the public within the past five years.  \n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nChemical safety at PGDP consists of the integration of environmental, safety, and health management systems to address chemical safety.  Chemical safety controls are designed to mitigate the adverse affects of the toxic materials used in the enrichment process to workers, the public, and the environment.  To achieve this objective, safety analyses, process hazard analyses, and industrial hygiene and safety programs are utilized.  PSM Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are used to identify and manage chemical risks and impacts.  Specific job-related risks and the technical and administrative controls used for risk management are addressed in the PHAs. \n\n5.1  Control Systems\n\nSeveral passive"

Loss of vacuum for any reason causes the vacuum-regulating valve to close the gas supply, minimizing the release in the event of a break in the manifold.\n\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with chlorine detectors which provide alarms to plant personnel in the event of a release.\n\nManually operated, remote valve closing rods are administratively required to be in place on the stem of open 1-ton chlorine container valves.  These valves can be operated from outside of the chlorinator rooms in the event of a release from the manifold system.\n\n5.1.2 Fluorine\n\nThe pressure reducing manifold regulators in C-410-K are housed in a ventilated enclosure.  Isolation valves in this manifold will automatically close and an alarm is activated if the F2 concentration in the enclosure's ventilation exhaust exceeds specified limits.  Pneumatically operated valves in the manifold will also automatically close if pressure exceeds specified limits during tube feeding or heeling operations.  During tube feeding operations, pneumatically controlled valves will automatically close and an alarm is activated if pressure downstream of the pressure reducing manifold exceeds specified limits or if the upstream piping experiences a rapid pressure drop that exceeds specified limits.  The high pressure control protects downstream equipment from a potential pressure regulation control failure during tube feed operations and the rapid pressure drop control minimizes the release that could result from a pigtail/connection failure.  During tube heeling operations, the feeding pressure regulation controls can be bypassed.  However, a control valve in the bypass line will not"

This control ensures that only low pressure tubes can be valved in to the process system during tube heeling operations.  Isolation valves will automatically close and an alarm is activated if the downstream pressure is higher than the upstream pressure.  This control minimizes back feed if a pigtail/connection failure occurs during heeling operations.  If these control valves fail during operation, system equipment is protected by a pressure relief system on the low pressure side of the pressure reducing manifold. \n\nThe fluorine distribution header in C-410-D is supported by two pressure reducing manifolds.  The manifold regulators are housed in separate ventilated enclosures.  One manifold is typically bypassed while the other is used to regulate the pressure of the fluorine distribution header to a nominal 5 psig.  Isolation valves in these manifolds will automatically close and an alarm is activated if the F2 concentration in the enclosures' ventilation exhaust exceeds specified limits.  Pneumatically operated isolation valves in the pressure reducing manifolds automatically close if the pressure in the fluorine distribution header exceeds specified limits.\n\n5.2  Procedures\n\nPlant procedures are prepared in accordance with the requirements of a formal procedure system.  The procedure program includes the development, review and approval, revision process, distribution, and procedure configuration management.  Specific procedures for the operation and maintenance of chlorine and fluorine systems and the handling of storage cylinders are managed within this procedure system.\n\n5.3  Training\n\nEmployee training is conducted by a dedicated training organization.
