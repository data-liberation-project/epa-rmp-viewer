If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared\n\nto work with the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Planning Committee or\n\nother authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the\n\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to\n\nfarmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop\n\nproduction nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers,\n\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees,\n\nauthorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes\n\nand regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's\n\n(CGA's) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", as adopted by state regulation\n\nand the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training\n\nof our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place"

Our emergency\n\naction plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to\n\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for\n\nimplementation at this time."
