The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities. Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but is utilized in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nMRS operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility. MRS's refrigeration system is designed to provide the following:\r\n\r\n- operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\r\n- economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required);\r\n- optimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilized instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant); and,\r\n- consistency of operations, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\r\n\r\nMRS has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. This was accomplished through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in every day operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nMRS (Midwest Refrigerated Services Inc.) is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees, and the surrounding community. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations are t"

First and foremost, this was performed to update the analysis to reflect the 2010 Census results.  In addition, the release estimates were modified due to the lack of any supporting data that identified which equipment was being used and any assumptions necessary to support that data (i.e., it was not possible to verify that the previous calculations were performed properly).\r\n\r\n2020:  The Offsite Consequence Analysis was revised to consider a release from the largest pressure vessel at 80% operating level.  This was revised to reflect the maximum expected charge in the vessel (high pressure receiver) that could occur during a system expansion where the system charge might be brought back to the compressor room for the expansion."
