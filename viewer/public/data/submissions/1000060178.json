      "SummaryText": "MRS is located at 11225 West County Line Road. This facility is a cold storage facility. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities. Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but is utilized in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.\n\n\n\nMRS operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility. MRS's refrigeration system is designed to provide the following:\n\n\n\n- operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\n\n- economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required);\n\n- optimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilized instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant); and,\n\n- consistency of operations, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\n\n\nMRS has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. This was accomplished through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in every day operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nMRS (Midwest Refrigerated Services Inc.) is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees, and the surrounding community. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations are t"

Compliance with these regulations helps prevent ammonia releases from the process. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of ammonia in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThe five-year accident history.\n\nThe emergency response program.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n1.

Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the MIDWEST REFRIGERATED SERVICES is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.

The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the MIDWEST REFRIGERATED SERVICES refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop two stage industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n\n\n3. The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program [emergency action program]\n\n\n\nMRS's emergency action plan is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119). Mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders if required. Our employees have been trained to take the appropriate actions necessary in our plan. The plan is coordinated with the Milwaukee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Milwaukee Fire Department. We conduct periodic drills for implementation of the emergency action plan at the facility, and anticipate increased participation with the LEPC and Fire Department.\n\n\n\nMRS's Emergency Evacuation and Contingency Plan has been developed in concert with the Milwaukee Fire Department and the Milwaukee County Emergency Response Government. The plan addressed fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria.

First and foremost, this was performed to update the analysis to reflect the 2010 Census results.  In addition, the release estimates were modified due to the lack of any supporting data that identified which equipment was being used and any assumptions necessary to support that data (i.e., it was not possible to verify that the previous calculations were performed properly).\n\n\n\n2020:  The Offsite Consequence Analysis was revised to consider a release from the largest pressure vessel at 80% operating level.  This was revised to reflect the maximum expected charge in the vessel (high pressure receiver) that could occur during a system expansion where the system charge might be brought back to the compressor room for the expansion.\n\n"
