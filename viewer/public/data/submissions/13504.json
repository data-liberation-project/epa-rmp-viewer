Our products are used throughout the adhesives industry to provide \" tack \" to such familar products as bandaids, tape, glue sticks, and diaper tabs.  Located at 12480 Scenic Highway, Baton Rouge, La., the plant has been in business at the same location since 1968.\n                                                    \n        A physical separation of resin from solvent occurs at the Exxon Resin Finishing Plant.  All process chemistry occcurs at the Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant.  A brief description of the physical separation is as follows:\n     \n        1)  Resin concentrate ( feed ) is shipped via pipeline from the Baton Rouge Chemical Plant and received in the Finishing Plant storage tanks.\n        2)  From the storage tanks the feed is fed to stripping towers where solvent and light molecular weight resins are taken overhead and returned to the chemical plant.\n        3)  The molten resin product is taken off the bottom of the towers and pumped to molten resin storage tanks.\n        4)  From the molten resin storage tanks the molten resin is then processed into one of various finished package forms.\n\n        Pentane, a colorless liquid with a \" gasoline \" odor, is the sole chemical on site that exceeds the threshold limits for a flammable chemical as set by the federal government.  It is used as a raw material component in resin production and exists on site as a recovered overhead from the stripping process.Total loss of containment of tank 502 ( which contains as much as 3,600,000 lbs. of a flammable mixture with pentane in it ), under the worst possible weather conditions, and an ensuing vapor cloud explosion of this mixture, would be the worst case scenario for a flammable at the Resin Finishing Plant.
