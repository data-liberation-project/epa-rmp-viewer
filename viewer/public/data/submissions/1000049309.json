The Second Base Facility is a butane transloading location (railcar to truck tanker) for subsequent distribution throughout the Tulsa region.\r\n\r\nAt Base Transport, Inc. - Second Base Facility, hereafter referred to as the Second Base or Facility, management and employees are committed to operating and maintaining this process in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Second Base believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding safety and environmental performance is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThe Facility is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which it operates. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. A description of our facility and the use of regulated substances\r\nB. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\r\nD. An overview of our emergency response program\r\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe primary function of Second Base, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma is to act as a railcar to truck tanker transloading facility.

Base Transport, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility has variable inventories of butane. Butane is received by railcar and temporarily stored in up to 52 approx. 30,000 gal. railcars. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded via site portable transloaders. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 Degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail-safe), emergency shut-off devices on the system, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding devices. Access to Second Base is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants.\r\n\r\nB.
