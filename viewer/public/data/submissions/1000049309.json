The Second Base Facility is a butane transloading location (railcar to truck tanker) for subsequent distribution throughout the Tulsa region.\n\n\n\nAt Base Transport, Inc. - Second Base Facility, hereafter referred to as the Second Base or Facility, management and employees are committed to operating and maintaining this process in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Second Base believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding safety and environmental performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which it operates. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of our facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of our emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary function of Second Base, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma is to act as a railcar to truck tanker transloading facility. The butane transloading process has been classified as Program level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances are identified. By virtue of the flammable effect"

Base Transport, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility has variable inventories of butane. Butane is received by railcar and temporarily stored in up to 52 approx. 30,000 gal. railcars. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded via site portable transloaders. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 Degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail-safe), emergency shut-off devices on the system, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding devices. Access to Second Base is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nBase Transport, Inc. accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs provide for effective management of the hazards posed by regulated substances to Facility employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP (40 CFR Part 68), as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR 1910.119). The following accident prevention program elements are in place at Second Base:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with Risk Assessments\n\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5) EHS Operator Training\n\n6) Contractors\n\n7) Pre-startup Safety Rev"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBase Transport, Inc. has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Facility maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases. This is a new butane process with no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Tulsa Fire Department. An EAP is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release, fire, and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, and SARA Title III. The programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required. The Second Base EAP provide the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Contained in these Plans are written procedures that outline the actions to occur for various types of emergencies that could occur at the Facility. These emergencies include: releases of chemical substances, fires, explosions, and medical events. The Programs address all aspects of emergency actions including:\n\n\n\n- Roles and "
