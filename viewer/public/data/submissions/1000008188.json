      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nGrosvenor Properties, Ltd. dba Grosvenor Donner Associates (Grosvenor) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the Grosvenor facility. \n\n\n\nGrosvenor's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Grosvenor's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Administrative Property Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversee the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n \n\nThe Grosvenor facility is located at 1600 Donner Avenue in San Francisco, CA. This facility provides refrigeration for food products. The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment cycles ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient hear caused the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid."

Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n?    The total ammonia inventory is 11,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with CalEMA's California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures-\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n \n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n\n?    IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\n\n\nBuilding Codes-\n\nThe facility was constructed to comply with the current edition of all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and requirements of the local, county, state, and national bodies having jurisdiction.  Special attention is directed to but not limited to:\n\n\n\n?    AHSI/ASHREA 15 1989   Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\n?    ANSI/IIAR 2 1984   Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n\n?    ANSI BB31.5 1983   Refrigeration Piping\n\n?

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n \n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Grosvenor facility maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated Emergency Coordinator for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, was conducted on June 11-12, 2009 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Grosvenor facility in San Francisco, California. The Grosvenor safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1.    Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2.    Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3.    Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.    Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
