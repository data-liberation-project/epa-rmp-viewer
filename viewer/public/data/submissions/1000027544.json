Regular checks are made of the system to ensure it is functioning properly and in good repair.\r\n\r\nThe facility has an emergency evacuation plan that includes ammonia leaks.  If an ammonia leak or an alarm indicating an ammonia leak is observed by facility personnel, the decision to evacuate the building is made by management.  Professional emergency responders and the facility's professional refrigeration service firm are called to assist with the ammonia leak. \r\n\r\nThe management at Contessa Foods is committed to safety.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nContessa is located at 4000 Noakes Street, in Commerce, California.  The facility is approximately 0.75 miles west of Interstate 710 and 0.5 miles south of Interstate 5.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility was constructed in 2007.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of Contessa Foods is to provide cooling for the processing and storage of food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the storage of chilled and frozen food products.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 5.6 psig on the low pressure"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, Contessa Foods operates in accordance with the PSM Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization.  \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSince starting the system in 2007, there have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tsave lives;\r\n\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\r\n\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\r\n\u00bf\tminimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator of the Contessa Foods facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Contessa Foods facility located at 4000 Noakes Street in Commerce, California.  The Contessa Foods safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have em"
