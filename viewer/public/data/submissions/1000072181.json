As a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Clean Air Act Amendments 112; Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has completed a risk management plan for chemicals stored onsite above reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC to include pentane (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold) and aqueous ammonia (exceeds 20,000 pound threshold).\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and process by products known as wet distillers' grain, distillers' syrup and distillers' corn oil, which are used as a livestock feed. Aqueous ammonia is stored onsite in liquid form in an above ground storage tank inside a secondary containment structure. Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control in the water and corn mash slurry as well as a nutrient for the growing yeast in fermentation. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 269,000 pounds (24 percent ammonia in water solution). The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) blended with ethanol at approximately 2.5% to render the product unfit for human consumption prior to shipping.  Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC include pentane (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold). The pentane is in a flammable mixture of Natural Gasoline (Denaturant).  Denaturant is stored in liquid form in an above ground storage vessel inside a secondary containment structure.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 412,000 pounds. Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as they relate to the regulated substances. An Emergency Action Plan (Integrated Contingency Plan, or ICP) "
