      "SummaryText": "The city of Fergus Falls is committed to the implementation of safe procedures regarding chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored at their wastewater plant.  The facility has an extensive Risk Management Program that follows OSHA and EPA guidelines.  The program emphasizes employee training, emergency response, and equipment inspection/maintenance.\n\nThe WWTP stores and utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide, both of which are regulated substances under this rule.  These substances are stored in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum quantity on-site at any given time is 8000lb per substance.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for the disinfection of treated wastewater prior to discharge.\n\nThe WWTP?s Risk Management Program covers all aspects of safely handling and storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  This program requires employees to routinely inspect and maintain all process equipment.  The program requires that employees receive training on all aspects of process equipment to ensure a safe operating environment, and more importantly, to minimize the possibility of a release.\n\nThe WWTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years.\n\nThe facility does not have its own emergency response program.  Response to releases and public notification will be handled by the local fire and police departments."
