Overall responsibility for safety resides with the Facility Manager.  Management is directly involved in the several Teams that oversee the Safety Programs.   These Teams are composed of a broad cross section of the employees.\n\nThe HES group oversees the implementation of the facility's risk management program.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team, consisting of fully trained volunteer members on duty for all shifts.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Braskem Marcus Hook Polymers facility manufactures Polypropylene, one of the most useful of plastics.  It is inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous and burns poorly.\n\nPropylene is the major hazardous material on site and it is this material which places Braskem in the RMP Program.  Similar to propane in characteristics, it is flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration.  It is handled under pressure in both its gaseous and liquid forms. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBraskem's Marcus Hook Polymers facility has active Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs.  Various elements of the program are distributed to site personnel,  who manage their elements under the coordination of the Process Safety Manager and Facility Manager.\n\nFacility employees participate in appropriate areas of the PSM/ RM programs such as participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, management of change (MOC) reviews, incident investigations, etc.  The company also works closely with outside agencies, including involving the outside agencies in company training programs.  Some features of the program include:\n\n- Fully trained operations and maintenance departments.\n\n- OSHA PS"
