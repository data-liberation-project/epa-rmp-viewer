SuperCool T6 A maintains a system that contains 21,190 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy.\nSuperCool policy demands a proactive approach to equipment maintenance. Equipment failure is the primary hazard facing a refrigerated storage facility. Frequent monitoring of equipment reduces the chances of an accidental release. SuperCool uses a rigorous inspection program to ensure that equipment is functioning properly and pays close attention to routine equipment maintenance. SuperCool employs only 2-3 people to work on the refrigeration process. Much of the equipment maintenance is performed by licensed contracting companies.\n\nSuperCool refrigeration employees have received \"Hazardous Materials Technician\" & \"First Responder\" training and are annually refreshed. The Emergency Response (ER) Plan includes notification of potentially affected neighbors. SuperCool extends their inspection/maintenance program to include emergency equipment as well.\n\nWorst- Case Scenario and Alternate Scenario or Accidental Release-\nThe Worst-Case release scenario will emanate from T6 A.. An EPA model was used in which the release occurs in the outdoor high pressure receiver and then migrates to the surrounding community. Should a major refrigeration line be significantly damaged or a major piece of equipment seriously malfunction and all 5900 lbs. of ammonia are released from this systems largest vessel, an area within approximately 0.9 miles of the facility could potentially be affected.\n\nA much more likely scenario involves a lifting safety relief valve from T6 A that requires 10 minutes to stop. This release was also modeled using EPA guidance. In this scenario approximately 920 lbs. of ammonia would be released and expected to t"

All Super Cool refrigeration employees are trained per the requirements of 29 CFR1910.120 and training is refreshed annually.\n\nEmergency Response Plan-\nSuperCool has coordinated its ER plan with the local authority (District VII) and the Polk County Fire Department & Hazmat Team (PCFDHM) The PCFDHM conducted a full dress rehearsal of a mock emergency response in June 1998 in order to acquaint themselves with the facility should a ER action ever be required. The local Police/Fire authorities will assist in notification of nearby citizenry in the event of a catastrophic release.\n\nSuperCool conducts monthly inspections of their Emergency Response equipment to ensure that all equipment is functioning properly.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\nSuperCool plans to install automatic ammonia leak monitors to improve their leak detection capabilities"
