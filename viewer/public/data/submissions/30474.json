Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APCI) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City, Kentucky is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:\n\n1.  The main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and\n2.  The storage, pipeline, and barge unloading source at the Tennessee River.  \n\nThe largest quantity raw material feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of Air \nProducts Polymers VAE Emulsions and Celanese Polyvinyl Alcohol.  Ethylene and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) are also used in the production of VAE and EVCL Emulsions.  VAM, VCM, and ethylene, in the quantities handled at this facility, are considered hazardous by EPA under the Risk Management Plan rule.  \n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI) is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and \nenvironmental performance.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky,and local rules and regulations.  The APCI Plant Manager at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.  The APCI Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S) Manager reports to the Plant Manager and has overall responsibility for compliance with all aspects of the facility's Risk Management Plan.  APCI EH&S operates under a tiered management system, with policies and procedures cascading from Corporate requirements to detailed plant operating and safe work practices.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), APCI subscribes to the Responsible Care program and has conducted a Management Systems Verification audit by outside reviewers.  \n\nAs a site that is in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, the Calvert City plant strives to prevent chemi"

Documentation of  these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation.  Trained and qualified employees work with sophisticated control systems that include instrumentation, alarms, and shutdowns to keep our processes operating in safe limits that minimize adverse impacts on the employees, the surrounding community, and/or the environment.  \n\nOperating instructions, startup/shutdown, and consequences of deviation define required operating conditions \nand steps needed to control normal and out-of-normal conditions. \n\nUnder PSM, employee involvement in all aspects of plant operations, its safety and environmental programs is \nrequired and met at the Calvert City plant.  Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random \nsubstance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant.  Our Basic Safety Process (BSP) contains many elements including management of change, hot work procedures, and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology.  All contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that APCI employees must follow.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees.  APCI shares emergency response resources on the plant site with the Celanese PVOH plant.  Both Air Products and Celanese participate in a partnership among the Calvert City area industries named the Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program or CIMAP.  The CIMAP organization collaborates with community emergency responders and citizens to form the core of a strong Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC.  APCI is an a"

The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this document, the scenarios described, and modeling techniques selected were chosen based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe APCI stationary source that makes up the storage, pipeline, and barge unloading facility at the Tennessee \nRiver is considered a separate facility under RMP.  This facility unloads Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) from \nbarges that are shipped from the Texas Gulf Coast up the Tennessee River to Calvert City.  VAM is unloaded from  the barges and transferred to one of two storage tanks, FB-4515 and FB-4516.  VAM is pumped to the main plant via a pipeline that runs from the river storage tanks to the main plant. \n\nThe only RMP regulated substance handled at this stationary source is Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), a toxic liquid.  The maximum quantity of VAM inventoried in an individual storage tank is 11,700,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:\n\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.  This protection  \nstarts with the facility design and construction.  APCI meets or exceeds all design and construction codes when implementing new projects in the plant.  A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping.  These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques with records maintained in the permanent equipment files.  \n\nBarge unloading activities are controlled by two people that are present during the unloading.

They can also contact emergency assistance via two separate means of communications. \n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including pressure relief \nvalves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.  Containment dikes \naround the storage tanks are designed to hold the entire contents of the tank.  \n\nEach plant process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and \nstart-up.  All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operating Plant Hazards Reviews (OPHRS) are conducted by teams of supervisors, engineers, operators, mechanics, and EH&S professionals.  \n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the production unit, plant, and corporate \nlevels.  These audits are documented as part of the basic safety process with corrective action defined and \ntracked through plant safety management systems. \n\n4.  Five year accident history:\n\nNone of the stationary sources or covered processes at the Air Products and Chemicals plant at Calvert City has had an incident in the last five years that would be reported under RMP.  There have been no releases of VAM that have had any off-site consequences, resulted in any employee injuries, or resulted in any significant \nequipment damage.  \n\n5.
