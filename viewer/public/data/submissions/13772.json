In order to meet this commitment, we have established systems to help ensure the safe operation of the covered process at this facility. Where applicable, we have also implemented programs that ensure compliance with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and further improve our overall performance.  One of these programs is the Risk Management Program (RMP), which helps the facility manage the risks involved in the use of liquid petroleum gas at the site and complies with the Accident Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs, 40 CFR Part 68 (the RMP rule), which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nThis Executive Summary is a component of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) that is intended to satisfy one of the requirements of the RMP rule. This provides the public with a general description of our RMP, which applies to the process that uses liquid petroleum gas, the only substance currently used in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.\n\nThe Executive Summary describes the following elements:\n\n1. Regulated Substance Used By C-P Jeffersonville Plant\n2. Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n4. Emergency Response Programs\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n6. Off Site Consequence Analysis\n7.

      "SummaryText": "our plant is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of our comprehensive safety program.  This safety program establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental releases and against the injuries and damage that could occur from accidental releases.  These safeguards include:\n\n 7 Limited use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.  Before using a substance regulated by the RMP rule (\"regulated substance\"), we consider less hazardous alternatives.  In the rare instance when we must use a regulated substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, contractors, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n 7 Preventing releases of the regulated substance used at the plant.  When a regulated substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Government and corporate standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\n 7 Limiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and respond to isolate or otherwise minimize the release, including contacting the local agency responsible for responding to accidental releases (Clark County Local Emergency Planning Committee [LEPC]) if emergency response actions are necessary. We work closely with the Clark County LEPC to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\n\nOur safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.  REGULATED SUBSTANCE USED BY THE C-P JEFFERSONVILLE PLANT\nThe C-P Jeffersonville p"

OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nThe RMP rule requires that we perform an offsite consequence analysis using methods and assumptions prescribed by EPA.  The regulations require that each RMPlan provide a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative case release scenario\" prepared according to EPA's methodology.  These scenarios are intended to estimate the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The usefulness of these scenarios is limited, however, because they do not reflect the lesser impacts of a more likely accidental release scenario.  In addition, they detract from the effectiveness of the accident prevention plan that we have implemented for the specific purpose of avoiding such an accident.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that there were a release, we do not expect that worst-case release scenario would ever occur.   Although the worst-case release scenario was developed to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by an accidental release, it is not a realistic scenario.  The conclusions of this scenario are based on unreasonable assumptions about the rate and duration of the release and overly conservative estimates of the conditions associated with the release.  It also completely disregards the active mitigation measures that the facility would take to stop the release in the event of an accident.\n\nAlthough the alternative case release scenario is more likely to occur, it still tends to overestimate the impact of the release.  This scenario accounts for active mitigation measures, but the measures that we would reasonably expect the facility to take are more effective than those that have been used in the assumptions.  In addition, the scenario does not account for site specific topographic features that would tend to reduce the impact of any explo"

As part of the shaving cream manufacturing processes, we handle one substance (liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]) in sufficient quantity to be regulated by the RMP rule.  The LPG used at the plant is a mixture of isobutane (80.9 wt. %) and propane (19.1 wt. %), and it is covered as a hazardous flammable material by the RMP rule.  This hydrocarbon gas is used as a propellant in the shaving cream cans.\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nWe are committed to the health and safety of our employees and contractors, and the community in which we operate, as well as the protection of the environment.  We take appropriate steps to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of our process.\nIn the event of an accidental release, we will strive to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment.  We provide response training to our personnel, including working with the Clark County LEPC for executing emergency response actions, so that they are well prepared to respond in the event of an emergency situation.\n\n3. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nWe have developed a comprehensive prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) regulation.

We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our plant.  These documents address (a) physical properties of the LPG, (b) operating parameters for our equipment, and (c) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to our employees.\n\n2. Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update a process hazard analysis of our LPG process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that will improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the LPG process.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the LPG process area. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  This analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n3. Operating procedures.  Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.

Training.  We train employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of LPG, and (c) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Demonstrations are used to help train employees.  Oral reviews and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can begin or resume work in the process.\n\n5. Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (a) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (b) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\n6. Management of change.  We have a written procedure to review and approve all proposed changes to the process, including chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.

The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n9. Incident investigation.  We have a program to investigate any incidents or near misses that could reasonably result in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We communicate to our employees the requirement to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  In the event of an incident, an investigation team would be assembled, and the investigation would be initiated as soon as possible, but always within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n10. Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation program for our covered process to help ensure that t"

Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program.\n\n11. Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our plant.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities related to the process are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures. Contractors are required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at our plant.  We routinely verify that this training has been provided.\n\n3.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to LPG.  The LPG is delivered in tank trucks that must be approved by the Department of Transportation. The LPG storage tank and equipment are designed and maintained to standards established by the federal government (e.g., NFPA 58) and by industry.  We have installed hydrocarbon detectors in the area of the storage tank and inside the plant near likely release points to alert operators of a release of the hazardous material and have equipped"

Low pressure detectors and interlocks, manual shutoff valves, and excess flow devices in the storage tank and in the lines are also provided as process controls that are in place to help prevent or mitigate releases of LPG from the system.\n\n4.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\nWe have established a written emergency response program to help ensure the safety of personnel who could be called on to respond to any accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n 7 Informing the Clark County LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n 7 Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\n 7 Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n 7 Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n 7 Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\n We have trained our employees to recognize and report emergency situations.  All of our personnel and contractors are trained in evacuation procedures.  The Clark County LEPC is responsible for notifying the public of the emergency situation, if necessary.\n\nThe written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations [e.g., the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38(a)], and a copy of the plan has been provided to the local fire department. Also, a hazardous material inventory has been provided to the Clark County LEPC and local fire department, as required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act.  C-P personnel from the Jeffersonville plant maintain a regular dialogue with local emergency planners.\n\n5.

On that basis, the alternative case release scenario was analyzed to assist in emergency preparedness and improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nAs required under the RMP rule, we have used the offsite consequence analysis to estimate the distance at which certain effects on the public or the environment might occur because of an accidental release (called the \"endpoint distance\").  Because it is based on the offsite consequence analysis, the endpoint distance is subject to all the same qualifications and limitations of that analysis.  For a release of a flammable material, the endpoint distance is defined by EPA as a 1-psig overpressure that results from a vapor cloud explosion following a release of the flammable material.\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis. \n\n6.1  Worst-case Release Scenario \nThe worst-case release scenario is based on a hypothetical failure of the LPG storage tank that results in the release of the entire contents of the tank.  For the purposes of the worst-case release scenario, the maximum possible inventory of the hydrocarbon mixture (i.e., 15,300 gallons/71,000 pounds) is assumed to be released, completely vaporize and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using the EPA methodology and prescribed assumptions, the worst-case release scenario would conclude that the overpressure generated by the explosion would reach some nearby offsite public receptors.\n\n6.2  Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario for the LPG is based on the hypothetical rupture of a 2-inch liquid line from the LPG storage tank.  In the unlikely event that this scenario were to occur, our operators are trained and equipped to quickly isolate the flow from the storage tank.  To evaluate this scenario, we assumed that it would take 10 minutes to stop the release by closing remotely operate"

In evaluating this scenario, we took account of mechanical mitigation measures (e.g., excess flow valves in liquid lines).  For the purposes of the alternative release scenario, the hydrocarbon mixture released is assumed to completely vaporize and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Using the prescribed EPA methodology and the highly conservative assumptions regarding active mitigation, the alternative release scenario would conclude that the overpressure generated by the explosion would reach some nearby offsite public receptors.  \n\n 7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n We constantly strive to improve the safety of our process using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.  All recommendations received by plant management are evaluated and are implemented where appropriate.  Standard operating and safety procedures for the covered process are reviewed periodically to ensure that they are correct, and we provide training to our employees on a wide variety of safety and operations topics."
