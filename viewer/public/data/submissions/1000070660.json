It is a management standard, meaning that it sets performance requirements for management programs, rather than prescribing specific methods that must be used to control the hazardous chemicals.  The requirement s are intended to prevent or reduce the risk of major industrial incidents that might expose employees to the hazards of toxicity, fire, or explosion.\r\n\r\nQPI's ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon proven and accepted engineering design practices. The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, International Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15, and the National Electric Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  All system pressure vessels are ASME rated and fitted with safety relief valves as required by ASME.\r\n\r\n5.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, QPI has not had any accidents.\r\n\r\n6.\tTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release of ammonia, the Omaha Fire Department and HAZMAT team would be called.

The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Quality Pork International strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets -both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Omaha Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.\tOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nQuality Pork International, Inc.
