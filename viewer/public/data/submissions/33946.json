              "Description": " Sistersvilles's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM prgram.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of the process.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally doumented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practicies, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lockout and Line breaking are in place and followied by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and included assesments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of prevention is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

              "Description": " Sistersvilles's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM prgram.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases of employee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of theprocess.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally doumented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practicies, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lockout and Line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and included assesments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of prevention is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administrative procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

They are:  R23/70, CNT, K62/63, K-65, K-1, K-2, K-3, K-4, K-21, K-18, K-36, SPCEU and CEU units, all of which utilize these chemicals.  Also referenced is Distribution which handles these chemcials.  PHA's have been conducted for all referenced units between December 1997 and March 2002 and revalidations performed on K-3 in mid-2003 and Distribution facilities during 3Q, 2003.  Sistersvilles's prevention program for RMP covered processes includes all required elements of the OSHA PSM prgram.  This includes an employee participation program which covers all phases ofemployee participation program within process safety and personnel safety issues.  A process safety information program is maintained which requires assembling of PSM required information prior to a PHA and retention of key PSI information for the life of the process.  Process hazards analysis are conducted on all PSM covered processes every 5 years and maintained for the life of theprocess.  Team membership includes personnel knowledgable in regards to the PHA process, unit technology, engineering standards and an operator.  Action plans are generated and tracked to timely completion with periodic status reports to management.  Major process hazards are formally doumented through a site Operational Safety standard program and unsafe zones of operation are documented through a site Crtical operating parameter program.  Operating procedures follow a preset format including all required PSM information with annual certifications and operator input into development.  Incidents and near misses are investigated in a timely manner with team composition based upon the complexity of the incident.  An MOC program is maintained which includes Pre-Startup, Facility Change review and Replacement in Kind packages utilized for all changes at the site.  A mechanical integrity program is in place which includes testing of PSM critical components on a routine basis based on good engineering practicies, manufacturer's recommendations and prevalent codes such as ASME.  Maintenance procedures are in place and process overview training has been conducted.  Life critical procedures including Hot-work, Hazardous work permits, Confined space entry, Master tag/lockout and Line breaking are in place and followed by the site.  Operators are trained on a routine basis and job skill verification is conducted to document that appropriate skills are present to operate equipment.  Other required safety training is conducted for all personnel at a frequency prescribed by internal needs and regulatory requirements.  Compliance audits are undertaken by the corporation at intervals not to exceed three years and included assesments of the PSM program at the site.  Internal audits are undertaken of selected PSM elements in each unit during the course of each year through the managers audit program.  The bulk of prevention is through engineering controls, including containment of spills in secondary containment, prevention of overfills through the use of alarms, tank levels and administraitve procedures when appropriate, perimeter monitoring where appropriate, and documentation of processing steps, corrections for deviations and emergency response procedures undertaken in the event of an emergency.",

Accidental Release and emergency response policies\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) requirements mandated in Section 112r of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on June 20, 1996.  These requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A through H.  Under the ARP program, processes with chemical quantities on site exceeding the listed threshold quantities have applicable requirements.\n\nThe Sistersville plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in safety and environmental protection, employee safety training, and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of plant equipment.  Sistersville's written safety and environmental policy state that \"Safety is unequivocally our number one priority\".  Sistersville has implemented reasonable controls to prevent and mitigate probable releases of hazardous chemicals.  Should a release occur, trained personnel would respond to control and contain the release.     \n    \n\n2.    Description of the Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sistersville plant is a silicone chemical producing facility located at 3500 South State Route 2 in Friendly, West Virginia.  The plant is situated on approximately 1400 acres in southern Tyler County.
