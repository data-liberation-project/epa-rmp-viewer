      "SummaryText": "f anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is approximately 2880 pounds/day with a storage capacity of 79,000 pounds in one tank, located in the south west corner of the facility (Figure 2).  For a more detailed description the anhydrous ammonia system see the anhydrous ammonia system equipment list and drawings. \n\n\n\nAmmonia and Its Properties (Appendix A - Ammonia MSDS)\n\n\n\nAmmonia is a colorless liquid with a strong, intense, suffocating odor.  It is a common molecule, given off by living organisms.  It is used to make fertilizers, animal food, synthetic fibers, glues and explosives.  It is also used in the treatment and refining of metal, and the manufacture of nitric acid, hydrazine hydrate and acrylonitrile.  It is often used in refrigeration. \n\n\n\n?Total ammonia? refers to the sum of ammonia (NH3) plus the ionized form (NH4+).  The toxicity of liquid ammonia solutions is primarily due to the presence of NH3, the percentage of which increases with pH and temperature.  Therefore, the toxicity of ?total ammonia? is greater in more alkaline water at higher temperatures.  It is also more toxic under conditions of decreased oxygen concentrations.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is a severe irritant of the eyes, respiratory tract and skin.  Exposures to and inhalation of large concentrations of aqueous ammonia can cause severe corneal irritation, dypsnea, bronchiospasm, chest pain and pulmonary edema, which may be fatal.  Exposure of the eyes to liquid ammonia may cause serious injury to the cornea and deeper structures and sometimes loss of sight.  Skin contact can cause extreme first- and second-degree burns and, if extensive, may be fatal. Extremely high concentrations of vapor can also result in skin burns.  With skin and mucous membrane contact, burns are of three types:  cryogenic (from liquid), thermal (from exothermic dissociation of ammonium hydroxide) and chemical (alkaline).\n\n\n\nPersonnel should avoid direct contact with ammonia.  If a less toxic chemical cannot be substituted for a h"

      "SummaryText": "azardous substance, engineering controls are the most effective way to reduce exposures.   The best protection is to enclose the operation and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at the site of the chemical release.  Using respiratory protection is less effective than engineering controls, but is still advisable whenever working with or around ammonia.  A NIOSH-approved, full-face piece respirator with ammonia vapor cartridge or canister is sufficient at low exposures.  A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with full-face piece and pressure demand is the recommended respiratory protection.\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls should also be in place to minimize the potential for human exposures.  These may include written procedures or policies, which specify the methods and techniques that will be practiced whenever personnel work with ammonia.\n\n\n\nAcute ecological effects may include the death of animals, birds, or fish and death or low growth rate in plants.  Acute effects are seen two to four days after animals or plants are exposed.  Under natural conditions of pH and temperature, ammonia has a moderate acute toxicity to aquatic life.  No data is available on the short-term effects of ammonia on plants, birds or land animals. Chronic (long-term) toxic effects may include shortened life span, reproductive problems, lower fertility and changes in appearance or behavior in exposed animals.  These effects can be seen long after the first exposure. Ammonia is not expected to accumulate in the tissues of fish.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is highly soluble in water.  Concentrations of 1,000 milligrams and more will mix with a liter of water.  Total ammonia is non-persistent in water, with a half-life of less than two days.

Also, Calgren Renewable Fuels process involving toxic (ammonia) is subject to OSHA?s PSM Program requirements.  Therefore, Calgren Renewable Fuels has a ?Program 3? process involving toxic (ammonia).\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Elements\n\n\n\nThe next step for RMP development is to conduct the hazard assessment.  The essential elements of this assessment are as follows:\n\n* Off-site consequence analysis parameters (discussed in worst-case and alternative release scenarios)\n\n* WCS analysis (completed in subsequent section of this document)\n\n* ARS analysis (one for each toxic chemical, completed in subsequent section of this document)\n\n* Defining off-site impacts on population. Population estimates and identification of major public receptors (i.e., schools, hospitals, other businesses, public roads)\n\n* Defining off-site impacts on the environment. Identification of any national or state parks, federal wilderness areas, officially designated wildlife refuges, etc\n\n* Review and update. Calgren Renewable Fuels will review and update this RMP at least once every five years as required by the standard.  Also, if changes to the process occur which might reasonably be expected to alter the distance to endpoint calculations, the plan will be reviewed and changes implemented within six months of such alterations\n\n* Documentation. Calgren Renewable Fuels will maintain derived records and subsequent documents generated as a result of this analysis\n\n* Calgren Renewable Fuels will maintain a five-year accident history "

Facility has had no incidents in the last five years resulting in any reportable occurrences as described by Section 68.42\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\nUsing the specified conditions set forth in the RMP Guidance EPA 550-B-98-110 and the EPA?s modeling program, RMP CompTM, the distance to ?toxic? endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is 5.1 miles.  Using 2000 Census Data, the estimated population within this radius is 7800 persons.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS) Analysis\n\n\n\nAn ARS is required for each toxic chemical held at the Facility above the TQ specified in Section 68.115 for facilities having Program 3 processes.  This includes completing an ARS for the chemical used in the WCS, as well as an ARS for each additional toxic chemical present in quantities above the TQ.  The ARS?s are to be developed with the additional criteria that they must be:  1) more likely to occur than the WCS and 2) the distance to endpoint is greater than the distance to the nearest public receptor, if such a scenario exists.  In the ARS, some of the specified weather conditions are changed with respect to the WCS and one is permitted to consider active mitigation systems, which would limit the release of the chemical.\n\n\n\nUsing the specified conditions set forth in exhibit 4-12 and 4-20 of the RMP Guidance EPA 550-B-98-010 and the EPA?s modeling program, RMP Comp, TM the distance to the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is 0.2 miles.
