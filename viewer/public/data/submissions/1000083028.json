The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 505 3rd Street in Chester, South Dakota (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is routinely filled to 85% capacity.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000-gallon and 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of 24 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying wit"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been one accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the facility within the five-year period prior to this plan.  On 14 April 2014, a Wilbur-Ellis employee was injured while preparing an anhydrous ammonia tool bar and nurse tank.  The hose and quick coupler to the tool bar had become loose and approximately one pound of pressurized anhydrous ammonia was released into the eyes of the Wilbur-Ellis employee.  An incident investigation was conducted following the accident and changes at the facility were implemented based on the findings of the investigation.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Chester Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency"

Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of compliance audits, hazard reviews, and a Risk Management Plan (RMP) site inspection conducted by an outside contractor.  The Branch Manager is currently working on an implementation schedule for the recommended actions.  Recommended actions include the following:\n\n\n\n1. Incorporate and implement non-destructive thickness testing into the RMP Maintenance Program consistent with RAGAGEP.\n\n2. Paint all nurse tank PVs that have peeling paint and show signs of rusting.\n\n3. Install rain cap on HRV 18 & 36.\n\n4. Install rain cap on nurse tank PV 23 HRV and inspect all nurse tank PVs for missing HRV or PRV rain caps and install rain caps.\n\n5. Inspect all nurse tanks for expired or soon to be expired PRVs and replace them. \n\n6. Replace Armstrong Class A/CA Series Y-Strainers 16 and 55 with Y-strainer constructed of steel, ductile iron, or malleable iron and that has a pressure rating (MAWP) of 400 psig.\n\n7. Inspect all nurse tank PVs for expired or soon to be expired transfer hoses and replace them. \n\n8. Install additional HRV with a pressure relief setting rated below 400 psig to relieve pipe pressure between valves 4, 5, and 17.\n\n9. Install an ESO in vapor load-out process piping with 5 lineal feet of the rise platform or a reasonable distance. Install actuation system such that the valve is actuated at the same time as ESO valve 5. \n\n10. Remove the cap from the ACME connection at the liquid load-in and inspect for a straining screen; and consider installing a straining device at the liquid load-in ACME connections if one is not curren"

Implement testing of underground piping, or abandon underground piping and install aboveground piping into a trench system. \n\n14. Conduct and document training on maintenance inspection and testing procedures using the form in the RMP Maintenance Program; or develop a training documentation form that is more suitable to the facility. \n\n15. Conduct and document inspections in accordance with the procedures, schedule, and forms specified in the RMP Maintenance program; or revise the Maintenance Program to specify the use of Facility approved inspection procedures, schedules, and forms. \n\n16.

The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describes methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur"
