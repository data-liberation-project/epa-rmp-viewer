      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nOverview.  Aerofil Technology, Inc. (Aerofil) owns and operates a contract aerosol packaging operation in Sullivan, Missouri (Site). Our Site maintains nine above-ground storage tanks (ASTs). These ASTs range in capacity from 5,000 gallons to 18,000 gallons (109,000 gallons total), which contain various combinations of propane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, and difluoroethane in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) presented under 40 CFR 68, more commonly known as the Risk Management Program.    These substances are considered regulated flammable substances by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and train our personnel combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Plan.  Our written Emergency Response plan is written in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulations 29 CFR 1910.38.  The purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of our employees in an emergency situation (fire, tornado, chemical spill, or other emergency).  The personal safety of each employee is and always will be of primary importance to Aerofil Technology, Inc.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities.\n\nAerofil Technology has emergency response plans coordinated with the Sullivan Fire Department.  A walk-through of the plant is conducted every year with the Fire Department.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario.  An explosion of the largest tank on site (18,000 gallons) when filled to the greatest amount would release 67,000 pounds of propane.  It is assumed for this scenario that the entire contents are released in a 10 minute period and finds an ignition source.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.3 miles.  This distance extends past the site boundary and encompasses several residences and other businesses.\n\nThe maximum amou"

      "SummaryText": "nt of flammable substances that can be stored on-site is 109,000 gallons.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario.  A ruptured pipe causes the release of flammable vapors into the air and the excess flow valve fails to stop the flow, causing the tank to completely empty over a 60 minute period.  The vapors are ignited and cause an overpressure of 1 psi to 0.2 miles beyond  the tank.  This distance extends past the site boundary and encompasses several residences and other businesses.\n\nPrevention Program.  Aerofill Technology has a prevention program in place that meets the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Employees have been trained of the procedures associated with the processes and the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n5-Year Accident History.  Aerofil Technolgy has not had any accidental releases of flammable substances that have resulted in off-site damage."
