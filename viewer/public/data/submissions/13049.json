As required by 40 CFR 68.155, BCP is including with the Risk Management Plan Submission the following Executive Summary.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBCP has a long-standing commitment to protection of the health and safety of its employees and the general public. It is BCP policy to provide the safest workplace possible for our employees while also minimizing to the fullest extent practical any impact on the neighboring community, which includes striving to eliminate accidental releases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes; providing proper training to personnel; having up-to-date operating procedures; and implementing an effective maintenance and mechanical integrity program.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to minimize the potential for releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in order to minimize to the fullest extent any possible impact on the neighboring community.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nBCP's Addis, LA facility is located just south of the township of Addis, LA in West Baton Rouge Parish on LA Highway 1.  The facility is bounded by LA Hwy. 1, servitude, and Harry S. Laws & Co. on the west, Harry S. Laws & Co. on the north, the Mississippi River on the east, and DSM Copolymer Corporation on the south.  There are no residential dwellings located in the immediate vicinity of the facility.   The facility has been in operation since 1979.

The regulated RMP chemical is the listed flammable vinyl chloride.  There are no RMP regulated toxics above the threshold quantity at the Addis facility.\n\n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nNOTE:  BCP has numerous controls to minimize the potential for releases and to manage their consequences, however, as required by rule, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating worst-case scenarios for vinyl chloride.  \n\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of two co-located vinyl chloride storage bullets.  Both bullets are considered because of their proximity to each other, and represent the largest quantity of Vinyl Chloride stored or involved in a process.  No administrative controls are considered in place to limit the storage inventory in the vessels; therefore, the full inventory of approximately 1,215,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 miles as determined by RMPComp. The potential population impact by such an event was determined to be 372 based on an enumeration of houses and dwellings within the 0.6-mile area of concern.  In addition to residences, a major commercial and industrial area is also potentially impacted.  Note that there are no schools, hospitals, recreation areas or prisons/correction facilities within this area of concern. \n\n\nFlammable Alternative Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from a release of the entire contents of two co-located vinyl chloride bullets.

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this ARS is 0.3 miles as determined by RMPComp. This scenario's area of concern does not impact on any residences, schools, hospitals, or recreational areas but does potentially impact a neighboring industrial facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at BCP's Addis facility.   Because the processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  Please note that due to time constraints, BCP addressed the request for the \"last date\" on which a particular activity was completed by entering the most recent date for completion of that respective activity as of the final version of that section of this report. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBCP employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees are involved in the writing of procedures and development of the training materials that accompany them.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.

Teams made up of employees and contractors meet on a regular basis to review and develop safety procedures, training programs, emergency response procedures, investigate process safety related incidents and report to the plant management safety team. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBCP has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have been advised of the location of the process safety information and trained in how to use the information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards such as those associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBCP has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential process safety hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses "

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, BCP updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every five years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBCP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process.  Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nTraining\n\nBCP has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in both safety issues and plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After an operator demonstrates (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, the operator can work independently.

Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractors are provided both plant-wide and unit-specific training using computer based training programs. The program includes a written test that requires an 80% passing score.  In addition, craftsmen must complete the eight-hour safety-training program for industrial workers provided by industry through the local safety council.  The training is maintained through annual refresher training.  The long-term contractors participate along with Borden Chemicals and Plastics employees as members of the safety teams tasked with the development of procedures, audits, accident investigation and training.  Additionally, Borden Chemicals and Plastics also provides monthly safety training for the contractor supervision.\n\n\nIn addition to the safety training, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find.  Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that necessary training, safety features, procedures, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBCP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

Employees have been trained concerning the various elements that would constitute a change such as parts, procedures, operating conditions, etc.  The change form provides an abbreviated version of the pre-startup review.  Management of the documents and approval to proceed are controlled at the department level.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBCP promptly investigates all process safety related incidents.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHA's and PHA revalidations.  A team of employees are permanently tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the investigation system for the over all benefit of BCP and associated industries.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, BCP periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.

BCP incorporates quality assurance measures (e.g., purchasing specifications and inspection procedures) into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nBCP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nBCP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, BCP has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used where appropriate:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n--    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n--    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n--    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n--    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n--    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n--    Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n--    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n--    Deluge systems for specific equipment\n--    Trained emergency response personnel\n--    Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere has been one accident that meets the criteria established under RMP that has occurred at BCP's Addis facility during the past five years.  A synopsis of the accident is listed below:\n\n1) December 24, "

      "SummaryText": "1997 - An overpressure situation in a slurry tank resulted in a vessel rupture and subsequent ignition of the small amount of vapor that was present in the tank.  A minor concussion wave resulted with the rupture of the vessel resulting in moderate damage within the immediate vicinity of the vessel with no off-site impact.  The Local Emergency Planning Commission was notified and responded to the facility.  There were no deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place or environmental damage associated with the release either on-site or off-site.  There is litigation related to this incident based on alleged exposure and property damage off-site by parties that were not downwind of the incident.  BCP believes that such allegations of injury or damages are false. \n\nBCP investigates every incident meeting RMP criteria very carefully to determine ways to minimize the potential for similar incidents from occurring in the future. While our goal is to eliminate the occurrence of such events, BCP recognizes that they may occur and therefore we also work to ensure proper response to minimize and mitigate any potential impact on our employees and the neighboring community.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBCP's Addis facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as we"

      "SummaryText": "ll as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  Emergency response program changes are administered such that informing and/or training affected personnel is accomplished prior to implementation of the change.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Addis facility is coordinated with the local Mutual Aid and response organization, local industries and the West Baton Rouge Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Addis facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response.  In addition to periodic meetings, the Addis facility conducts periodic emergency drills. \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe Addis facility addresses each recommendation resulting from process hazard analyses.  Some recommendations result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned:\n\n    Revision of personnel training programs \nReviewing instrumentation schemes \nImprove HazMat supply's and personnel protection \nRevise facility-wide core safety procedures.\nRevise accident investigation program and provide investigation training.\nUpgrading Emergency Communication systems and procedures both on and off-site."
