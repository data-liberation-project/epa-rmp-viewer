Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered a hazardous material. The properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community. It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility operates two biomass-fired, electrical generating units. Unit I is designed to generate 30 MW gross (28 MW net) of electrical power; and Unit II is designed to generate 25 MW gross (21 MW net) of electrical power. The plant burns agricultural, wood fuels, and other crop wastes in a fluidized bed boiler to generate high pressure steam which drives a turbine generator.\r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is used at the plant to control nitrogen oxide NOx emissions in the boiler flu gas.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received at the plant via a liquefied-gas tank-truck and stored in a single 30,000 gallon capacity tank.\r\n\r\nThere is a daily maximum of 132,000 lb of ammonia at the facility.\r\n\r\n3a. Administrative Controls\r\n\r\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the ammonia system and the training provided to the ammonia system operators.\r\n\r\n3b. Mitigation Measures\r\n\r\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of ammonia released to a minimum, if a release were to oc"

      "SummaryText": "cur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\r\n\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations. There are safety meetings and safety training. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\n- 5/8/2010 Ammonia leak from loose blank flange (less than RQ released)\r\n- 6/6/2011 Release from vaporizer relief valve from unit being energized during maintenance work (less than RQ released)\r\n\r\n6. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the local Fire Department and other agency emergency response teams at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. The Kern County Fire Department, as the Administering Agency for the CalARP program, can corporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed on a continual basis to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the ammonia system."
