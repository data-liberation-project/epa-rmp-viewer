The Facility\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Harvest Land Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  IF an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and any other agencies to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 280,000 pounds with our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative -Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst case and alternative case scenario.  However, it has been withheld from this executive summary as security sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", Published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\" IN addition, Minnesota Department of Ag Rules.\n\n\n\n5. The 5 Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nHave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.
