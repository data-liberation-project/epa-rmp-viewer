      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting treated wastewater.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Central District Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) for disinfecting treated wastewater for in-plant reuse and on-site irrigation.  The Central District WWTP also produces digester gas and stores it for on-site use as fuel.\n\n\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine and digester gas can create hazardous situations.  The Central District WWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals seriously.\n\nThe Central District WWTP chlorine handling and digester gas processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and an update to the RMP every five (5) years.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the chlorine process, including a description of the possible consequences if the procedures are not followed, and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of a chlorine or digester gas release.\n\nThe following information is provided below in this RMP Executive Summary:\n??A?

The Central District WWTP has two separate liquid treatment trains that are referred to as Plant 1 and Plant 2 which are rated at 60 mgd and 83 mgd, respectively.  The facility stores chlorine and digester gas, which are regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.  The two chlorine systems (for Plant 1 & 2) supply approximately 7,400 pounds of chlorine per day to the wastewater effluent and the non-potable water system.\n\n\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton containers to the Central District WWTP chlorine buildings.  The chlorine buildings are divided into a covered chlorine storage area and a chlorination room and the safety system for each chlorine process operate in a similar manner.  The one-ton containers contain liquid chlorine under pressure.  The storage area in Plant 1 is equipped to store up to 32 (cylinders) tons of chlorine.  The storage area in Plant 2 is equipped to store up to 46 (cylinders) tons of chlorine. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Central District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nThe pressure from the stored chlorine in the cylinder forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the manifold system. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the cylinder through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the ch"

The chlorinators are equipped with a gas Rotometer and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe Central District WWTP chlorine systems are provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include, but are not limited to automatic emergency shut-off valves, chlorine leak detectors, audio and visual alarm system, isolation valves, high and low temperature alarms, high and low pressure alarms, pressure regulators, expansion tanks, bursting disks, and pressure relief valves.  Chlorine Kit B and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus are available in the event of a chlorine release.  These major safety features are located in the chlorine storage area and in the chlorinator room.\n\nAutomatic emergency shut-off valves are located immediately after located immediately downstream of the manifold system.  Pushing one of the emergency shut-off switches (kill switches) activates the emergency shut-off valves.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine storage area and in the chlorinator room.  The automatic shut-off valves can also be activated automatically by the chlorine leak detection system sensing chlorine at a concentration greater than 0.5 ppm.  Additional manually-operated isolation valves are located throughout the chlorine system.\n\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine storage area and chlorinator room is activated when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.

In addition, the Central District WWTP also receives a mixture of primary sludge/WAS from the North District WWTP.  The sludge treatment process is divided into two trains from secondary clarifiers through anaerobic digestion.  One train is associated with Plant 1 at the Central District WWTP and receives WAS from the Plant 1 secondary clarifiers.  The Plant 2 train receives WAS from the Plant 2 secondary clarifiers in addition to the North District WWTP sludge.  After anaerobic digestion, the sludge treatment processes are combined into a single process train.  The sludge streams are first conditioned with polymer and fed to gravity thickeners.  The sludge, from the thickeners, is then pumped to two-stage anaerobic digesters for stabilization.  The gas produced by the digestion process is compressed, scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and stored on-site in two compressed gas spheres.  The digester gas is used to power engine-driven blowers and electric generators.  Electricity generated by burning the digester gas is used to power some of the plant equipment.  Waste heat from the gas-powered engines is used to heat the primary digesters.  The maximum quantity of digester gas present at the Central District WWTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  \n\nSeveral safety features are part of the digester gas process.  These safety features include, pressure and flow manometers, meters, switches and transmitters, which are used to monitor the system performance for high or low pressures, temperatures and flows; and digester pressure relief valves and Sphere pressure safety valves, which are used to relieve excess pressure in the system.
