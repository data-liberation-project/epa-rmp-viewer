      "SummaryText": "Bidart Bros. is a small-size cold storage facility.  Its primary design is to house grapes and apples in a cold, stable environment by means of refrigeration, using ammonia as its primary refrigerant.  Ammonia is a very safe and stable material when handled properly.  This facility accommodates 5600 gallons or 28840 pounds of material.\n     The ammonia refrigeration system and the building in which it is housed, in terms of design and choice of materials, were constructed in compliance with all Federal and State building codes.  Compliance includes such safety devices as emergency shut down, relief valves and check valves.  Additional safety measures have been added that were not required by building code, including a fully automated ammonia detection system.  This system works as an early warning device to detect releases or leaks of the slightest amount.  When activated, emergency response teams are contacted and dispatched immediately.  These teams comprise trained employees and members of our city and county emergency response team (i.e. Fire Dept., Police Dept.).  It is their responsibility to notify local public receptors of any danger to life and environmental impact.\n     In the twelve years this plant has been in operation there have been no incidents in which major or minor releases have triggered these responses.  Bidart Bros. is prepared for a worst case scenario.  In the event of a liquid ammonia release at the cold storage facility, up to a maximum of 5600 gallons, automated detection equipment would notify Bidart Bros.'s emergency response team.  The emergency response team would immediately implement administrative control to minimize the release.  This could be a mitigating measure such as closing an emergency shut-off valve, or following other operating procedures that would reduce or control the release.  While response by the  onsite team members is continuing, the city or county emergency response organization will be notified by the onsite emer"

      "SummaryText": "gency manager.  It is this offsite organization who will provide the primary access, control and containment of the spill.  At this time local receptors will be notified by Bidart Bros.  if there is a hazard.  In a worst case scenario, using OCA guidance modeling, the estimated distance of toxic end point would be 2.7 miles.  All receptors inside this area that could be affected will be notified by Bidart Bros. \n     This worst-case scenario could occur only if  the largest vessel in the facility ruptured.  The likelihood of such a spill spreading far beyond the confines of the building is very small.  The spill would be passively controlled by the location of the vessel, being inside a concrete tilt-up wall structure with a sprinkler system, that would be used to knock down the vapor cloud.\n     A more likely release scenario would be a liquid line rupturing or the possibility of a spill when filling an ammonia storage vessel.  This event would put into action the Bidart Bros.emergency response team.  Local emergency response agencies would be notified as to the severity and they would respond accordingly.  In the event of a rupture or breaking of a liquid line, onsite team members would shut down the process and valve-off appropriate lines to minimize the release.  Local receptors, would be contacted and notified as to the hazard.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint, using OCA guidance modeling, is .08 mile.  \n     These policies and programs comply with all OSHA PSM rules and regulations.\n     Operating ammonia refrigeration can be a very safe process.  It requires constant supervision by well trained personnel and responsible management, working as a team inside the facility as well as outside with State and Federal agencies and public receptors."
