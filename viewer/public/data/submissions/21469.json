The maximum quantity of propane that could be stored on site is 560,000 gallons (2,400,000 pounds).  The facility receives propane by pipeline, stores the propane in eight 63,000-gallon and two 60,000-gallon (water capacity) bullet tanks, and then loads propane onto customers' highway transport trucks.\n\nProcess controls are in place at the facility that include: automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facility has UV/IR fire detection eyes process area detectors. \n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) is the entire release of a full tank of propane, which is 57,000 gallons (240,000 pounds), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under EPA requirements, the WCS assumes weather conditions which allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning. Based on these assumptions, the WCS vapor cloud explosion could potentially affect nearby public receptors.  The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nAlso, the facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  Under OSHA, DOT, and EPA requirements, facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing, and emergency response training and drills. The response training and drills programs includes notifications to the State Emergency Planning Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department.  These three agencies also receive SARA Tier II annual chemical inventory reports.  In addition, the facility is inspected and audited on a compliance schedule.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at least every five years as part o"
