CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with LANETT FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous). The Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide  are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 5,350 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous),  is present at our facility in quantities of 12,000  lbs\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as RMP*COMP VER. 1.06. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release fr"

With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a 2000 lb. SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nP. B. & S. CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
