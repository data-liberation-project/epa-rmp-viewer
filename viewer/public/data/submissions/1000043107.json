In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used to neutralize residual chlorine after the transfer process.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the Pool Chlor of Tempe facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable chlorine releases over the past five years (May 2009 - May 2014) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nPool Chlor of Tempe is a designated non-responding facility.  If a release of chlorine were to occur, Pool Chlor of Tempe's action plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Hill Brothers Chemicals would be contacted to perform any repairs.  Pool Chlor of Tempe has a B-kit available at the facility in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nPool Chlor of Tempe has revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (March 2014) which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Pool Chlor facility located at 411 W.
