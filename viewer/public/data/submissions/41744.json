ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Steuben Foods recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The Steuben Foods PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing date has passed.\n\n     Steuben Foods believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Maintenance Manager and the Refrigeration System Operators, have been deeplly involved and they paarticipate actively in the safe operation of the  Steuben Facility in Elma, New York.\n\n     The Steuben Foods Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Elma Fire Department.  All Steuben Foods employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Steuben Foods is a Manufacturer of Aseptic dairy products.\n     The refrigeration system contains Anhydrous Ammonia which is recognized as an Accutely Hazardous Material by both OSHA and the EPA.. \n      \n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical Studies and Reports that are also required.\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE STEUBEN FOODS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Steuben Foods conducts an annual PSM/RMP im"

Steuben Foods considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Steuben Foods emphasizes and insists on  \"employee participation\" from the refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Steuben Foods provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia refrigeration employee.\n\n     Steuben Foods maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia at Steuben Foods that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Steuben Foods conducts an annual training and response exercise with the Elma Fire Department to practice, train and update the Emergency Response Program.\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release in a defensive manner.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Elma Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Steuben Foods recognizes that even good PSM/RMP Programs require constant attention and improvement.  The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" truly becomes \"second nature\".\n\n     Steuben Foods expects to improve PSM/RMP and safety performance by emphasizing the following e"
