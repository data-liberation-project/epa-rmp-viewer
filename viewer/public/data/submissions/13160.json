This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for each covered process must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint off site, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is evaluated using the same techniques as the worst-case scenario to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B '68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\n\nDue to the presence of trees, and other structures in the immediate vicinity of the McCook Metals facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine is defined as a release of all the contents of one chlorine storage tank in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This translates to a release of 2,000 pounds of Chlorine in 10 minutes or 200 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the Chlorine is a liquefied gas; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for Chlorine show that the plume must travel 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) before dispersing to the endp"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the McCook Metals, L.L.C. (McCook Metals) facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to McCook Metals employees, the surrounding public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nMcCook Metals' management is committed to providing all the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nMcCook Metals manufactures aluminum coil stock and plate stock from virgin and scrap aluminum and various hardening alloys.  The facility has various melting and holding furnaces, hot and cold rolling mills, annealing and soaking furnaces, and ancillary equipment.  These operations cast ingots and roll and cut the aluminum into the desired product.  Figure 1 shows the site location and Figure 2 shows the facility layout.\n\nOne chemical, Chlorine, is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP.  Chlorine is part of the mixed gas used for aluminum fluxing purposes.  Chlorine is delivered in one-ton cylinders, which are connected to the central chlorine system at the east end of the Cast House.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\nRMP regulations require that each facility complete worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios.  USEPA has defined a worst-case toxic release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a re"

Figure 3 shows the worst-case release zone.\n\nThe selected alternative release scenario for the Chlorine system is a release from a broken line in the plant containing mixed gas.  This scenario is based on the most recent incident involving the mixed gas system.  It was determined that the release rate of chlorine is 15 pounds per hour per cylinder.  There are two cylinders connected to the system at all times.  This yields a release rate of 30 pounds of chlorine per hour.  \n\nEPA's computer model, RMP*Comp Version 1.06, was used to calculate the endpoint distance for this alternative release scenario using typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It is estimated that the maximum response time to this leak would be 60 minutes.  Based on the release rate of 30 pounds per hour, the total amount released is 30 pounds. Other assumptions include no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative release scenario for a Chlorine release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/L is reached at 0.1 miles (160 meters) from the release point.  Figure 4 shows the alternate-case release zone. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe McCook Metals facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the surrounding public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n\n7 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n7 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n7 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n7 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in McCook Me"

McCook Metals management and hourly personnel are members of employee teams organized to generate documentation and to provide ongoing PSM support. Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Chlorine system.  McCook Metals employees are also members of the facility emergency response team. McCook Metals has an emergency response plan in place and sufficient equipment on site for an initial response to most Chlorine releases.\n\nMcCook Metals policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  McCook Metals maintains a program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\n\nMcCook Metals is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, McCook Metals conducts refresher training at least every three years, but may be held more frequently, if the process operators or management team deem it necessary.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of McCook Metals' emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nMcCook Metals has had three releases of Chlorine from the McCook, Illinois facility within the last five years; the largest release was 7,600 pounds over a 152-hour period.

These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.  Emergency response is also coordinated with the LEPC.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMcCook Metals completes a thorough review of the Chlorine system each time a design change is implemented.  McCook Metals is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of the system.  The PSM committee is involved with any modification of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the Emergency Response Plan."
