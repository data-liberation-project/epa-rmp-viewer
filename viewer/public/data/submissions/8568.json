This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    Regulated Substances Handled at the SCI Madison Plant\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Secondary Aluminum Melting and Casting, Secondary Magnesium Melting and Casting, Aluminum and Magnesium Extrusion, Aluminum and Magnesium Rolling.  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propane, Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Boron Trifluoride  [Borane, Trifluoro-] and Chlorine.  Propane is used as fuel for mobile service vehicles.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as a cover gas in a magnesium casting process.  Boron Trifluoride  [Borane, Trifluoro-] is used for corrosion prevention during various heat treating processes.  Chlorine is used for degassing of molten aluminum metal.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 13440.00 lb. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Boron Trifluoride  [Borane, Trifluoro-] and Chlorine are present at our facility in quantities of 12000.00 lb., 4060.00 lb. and 2880.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release sc"

      "SummaryText": "enario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Magnesium Cover Gas.  In this scenario 8000 lb. of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 9.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Magnesium Cover Gas.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 2.0 miles.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Aluminum Holding Furnace.  The scenario involves the release of 160 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.31 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Aluminum Holding Furnace.  The scenario involves the release of 10 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.08 miles.\n\nPropane dispensing qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst case scenario for this process 6720 lb. of Propane is released.  It is assumed tha"

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.15 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  This distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSpectrulite Consortium Incorporated maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent update was performed on 06/15/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Spectrulite Consortium Incorporated maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nSpectrulite Consor"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  A reduction in the amount of propane stored on site, replacement of 1ton Sulfur Dioxide cylinders with smaller 150 lb cylinders, and installation of improved Boron Trifluoride process storage racks are some of the major steps we are taking to improve safety at our facility with respect to these substances.  These changes are expected to be implemented by July 1, 2000.\n"
