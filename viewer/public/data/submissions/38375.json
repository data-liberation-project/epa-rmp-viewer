(PCI), its management and employees are committed to the safe, responsible management of all manufacturing operations.  The safety of our employees and neighbors is of primary importance.  Our combined safety programs include the Risk Management Program, Process Safety Management Program for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM), Emergency Response Plan, and other supporting policies and procedures.   These are created and maintained to provide a high degree of protection against the uncontrolled release of ammonia and provide sufficient warning to employees and nearby residents of any incident with the potential for a catastrophic release.\n\nPCI's Risk Management Plan  meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 68, Risk Management Plans and, 29 CFR part 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  PCI's Emergency Response Plan has been submitted and approved by the state of Michigan and Houghton Co. LEPC, as required by EPCRA  and is revised and updated as needed.\n\nPCI's Risk Management Plan applies to anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7), its storage and use pursuant  40 CFR part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 as well as State of Michigan Air Quality Division, Air Use Permit Special Conditions.   Ammonia -containing solutions containing less than 20% ammonia by weight are exempt from these regulations.\n\n\nApproach to Safety\n\nSafety is addressed throughout the corporation using cross-functional teams to advise and assess its current programs and evaluate the need for additional processes and procedures to maximize safety for its employees and community neighbors.  Expert support resources from government and industry supplement internal resources and provide necessary guidance on safety management as well as compliance with all applicable regulations. \n\n\nProcess Description\n\nPCI manufactures cupric ox"

The first step in the production of both products is dissolution of metallic copper in a solution of ammonia, carbon dioxide and water.  In solution, the copper is oxidized, precipitated, and dewatered according to specific recipes to produce the resultant products, cupric oxide or basic copper carbonate. Ammonia used in the process solutions is supplied to, and stored at, the facility as anhydrous ammonia.  As needed, it is injected into the plant solutions where it is dissolved.  The concentration of ammonia in the process solutions normally ranges from 8%-12% by volume.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received in the liquid state and stored as a liquid with a vapor space above the liquid. Maximum storage capacity is 12,000 gallons.  The tank is filled to approximately 80% capacity, or 9,600 gallons.  This practice allows room for the vapor space in the tank.  Tank pressure varies from a minimum of about 100 psig to over 200 psig in hot weather.  Ammonia can be drawn from the tank as a liquid or vapor, but is metered into solution only as a vapor at a pressure less than 100 psig.\n\nPCI's Offsite Emergency Response Plan was developed jointly between PCI and the Houghton Co. Office of Emergency Measures (OEM), approved by the county Local Emergency Planning Committee in 1999 and submitted to the state of Michigan.  This plan is filed with the Houghton County Office of Emergency Measures,  the state of Michigan, and the Hubbell Volunteer Fire Department.  The Houghton County OEM and LEPC are currently planning a table top exercise using PCI's plans to be conducted in June/July of 2004 leading to full response exercise in 2005.  PCI and its employees have been trained to provide information and logistical support to responder agencies.  No active response by PCI employees is provided at present.\n\nThe potential for a catastroph"

The storage facility is enclosed in a fenced area and heavy guarding protects the tank from accidental impact from yard equipment and delivery vehicles.  The tank and all associated piping are equipped with pressure relief valves, excess flow valves, and remotely operated emergency shut off valves.   The entire ammonia storage facility is permitted by the  Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Air Quality Division.  Annual inspections are performed by state officials as well as the inspections required by the Process Safety Management regulations and other state and federal occupational safety agency regulations.\n\n\nPrevention Program Elements\n\nPCI has instituted a comprehensive prevention program as required by the OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and the permit conditions in our state of Michigan Air Use Permit.  LaRoche Industries is the owner of the storage tank and associated equipment upstream of the vapor lines to the plant.  LaRoche conducts regular inspections on all components of the system to ensure safe, reliable operation.  \n\nPCI involves employees in this program at all levels,  in cross-functional safety teams whose responsibilities include the evaluation of internal safety processes related to ammonia storage and handling.  Frequent inspections provide current information on the condition of the equipment and its operation as well as reinforcing the awareness of the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  PCI's Hazard Communication Training Program focuses heavily on the hazards and safe handling of ammonia.\n\n\nAccidental Release Report\n\nPCI has neither observed nor recorded any incidents of accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAs described above, PCI takes a defensive response posture.  Any employee who observes an unplanned release is directed to either immediately contact a supervisor or, if in his/her judgement the release threatens t"

On-site personnel are evacuated to a safe assembly location(s).  Emergency response agencies are notified of the situation and senior employees on site serve as information resources for the responding agencies.  PCI management will be notified and serve as liaisons between responder agencies and the company.  PCI's internal emergency response procedures were reviewed by a cross-functional safety team in 2002.  PCI's Emergency Response Plan and EPCRA offsite response plan were updated during the summer of 1999.  Since that time, reviews have not resulted in significant changes, mostly comprising updating names and contact information.\n\nTraining is accomplished annually or during new employee orientation.   Local VFD's are provided a plant tour and review of  PCI's operation annually.   County incident response exercises include PCI staff.  Through the Houghton County LEPC, table-top exercises of an ammonia incident are planned for June/July 2004, with the goal of a full response exercise in 2005.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nElements of PCI's safety program including the specific programs referenced in this document are reviewed and updated at specified intervals and in reaction to event investigations.  PCI's PSM program is audited and reviewed at specified intervals.  This approach is part of the company's continuous improvement philosophy.  Monitoring equipment potentially useful for our installation is evaluated to determine its ability to improve the overall safety of the ammonia storage system."
