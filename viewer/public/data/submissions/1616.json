Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPeterson's North Branch Mill routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes\nand modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPeterson's North Branch Mill conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether\nthe plan's provisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-\ncompliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPeterson's North Branch Mill truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention\nis a team effort.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Peterson's North Branch Mill in Cambridge are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Cambridge Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Cambridge (Figure 1).  The maximum\namount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following describes these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and an urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).\n\nThe alternative release scenario"
