Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nn-Pentane is used as a raw material in the manufacturing of expandable polystyrene at Dart Polymers, Inc.'s Owensboro, Kentucky facility.  n-Pentane is listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) as a regulated substance and therefore is subject to the regulations and their requirements.  The same properties that make n-pentane valuable as a raw material to our process make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while handling it in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to health and safety of the workers, reduce the threat to nearby members of the community, and to protect the environment.  Dart Polymers' accidental release prevention includes the observation and practice of all Federal and State rules and regulations applicable to n-pentane.  Safety depends on the manner in which n-pentane is handled, training of personnel in safe handling procedures, and on the safety devices inherent in the design of the Dart Polymers facility.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response policy of Dart Polymers at the Owensboro facility is based upon the safety of the employees and the community.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\n\n\nThe primary products of the Dart Polymers facility are polystyrene resins and expandable polystyrene.  n-Pentane, a regulated substance, is used in the impregnation process for manufacturing expandable polystyrene and is present in a quantity greater than its 10,000-pound threshold.  Two underground storage tanks supply the impregnation process.  When necessary, a railcar is used to refill the storage tanks.  A third tank stores reclaimed pentane from the pentane recovery system.  Access to the n-pentane tanks and process"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nDart Polymers' safety program is dedicated to continuous improvement and proactive planning.  This program includes the promotion of internal communication and safety awareness among all employees via monthly safety training and informational meetings and through the actions of the employee safety committee.  These efforts are used to solicit feedback and suggestions from employees on ways to improve the facility safety program.  Since the previous RMP submittal, Dart Polymers has implemented various safety initiatives.  An example is the Dart Observational Tour for Safety (DOTS), in which all plant supervisors make intentional contact with employees on a weekly basis to discuss plant and personnel safety and solicit feedback.\n\n"
