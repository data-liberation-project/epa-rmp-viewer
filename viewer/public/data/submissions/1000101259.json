These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within SESA are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/-exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nSESA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nSESA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nSESA maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) startup after an emergency shutdown, (7) operating limits, and (8) safety and health considerations.

In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least once every three years on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nSESA uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\nSESA has a hot work program in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  The hot work permit and procedures are designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the hazardous area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nSESA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the facility processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nSESA promptly investigates all incidents that results in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards th"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for a minimum of 5-years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\nSESA has a written emergency action plan that describes the safety and emergency procedures and tools recommended to be used to handle and control accidental spills and/or fires in the anhydrous ammonia storage and processing area.  All personnel are trained in standard first aid and CPR training.  In the event of an emergency, plant personnel can contact the Brazoria County Fire Department.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, SESA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  SESA management will certify that the PSM has been evaluated at least every five (5) years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant personnel for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe production processes at SESA have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

      "SummaryText": "RGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nSESA maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substances.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\r\nPlant employees are trained to handle small emergencies only.  Employees are not trained to respond to RMP releases.  In the event of an RMP release, employees will activate shutdown procedures, evacuate the plant, and notify local emergency response teams.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant processes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for SESA is coordinated with the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) organization.  CAER is a mutual aid organization consisting of multiple corporate entities located in the local area that coordinate all emergency response activities with the community response agencies.  SESA has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(f)\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nBased on the information detailed in the previous sections SESA has no current operational plans regarding changes to the existing safety procedures other than evaluating for continual improvement opportunities.  SESA has an active MOC system in place and is continuously training employees in safe operating procedures."
