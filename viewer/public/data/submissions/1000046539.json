This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant communicates all hazard review findings with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard review results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the Hazard Review team.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures will be revised as necessary through the management of change process. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Elm Grove Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Enable Midstream Partners, LP (Enable Midstream) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nEnable Midstream operates the Elm Grove Gas Plant located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.    The Elm Grove Plant is a natural gas processing plant that produces natural gas liquids (NGL), a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and C6+ compounds, using the Joule-Thompson separartion technique.  NGL and condensate are transported from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Elm Grove Gas Plant is a Program 2 process. \r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with t"

The Elm Grove Gas Plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations but not OSHA's PSM standards because the plant is unmanned.  This summary describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program implemented by CenterPoint.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe company also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  CenterPoint utilizes standard operating manuals for pumps, controls and relief valves, as well as ANSI, ASME and UL Ratings.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified an"
