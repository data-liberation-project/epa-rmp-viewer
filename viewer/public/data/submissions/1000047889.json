To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.

Program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is scheduled to be reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit is created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entire system, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from the hazard analysis are addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Price Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility intent that the PSM/RMP for the facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.

The refrigeration operators will do only \"defensive\" actions to control and contain an ammonia release as much as possible without endangering themselves.  Price Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility has also coordinated with the Yakima County LEPC and with the local emergency responders (Gleed Fire Department).\r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Improvement\r\nPrice Cold Storage, Apple Valley facility holds quarterly safety committee meetings with all Management representatives where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  There is also a regular staff meeting for all staff supervisors.
