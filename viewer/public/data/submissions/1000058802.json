As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia, chlorine, and hydrogen chloride.  \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined in the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program for this facility.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling of highly hazardous chemicals. Written procedures have been developed for handling and inspecting the chemical cylinders.  The company training policy requires all employees to be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.  The facility's maintenance program requires periodic inspections of process and safety equipment to ensure they are in good condition.  Overall, our program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  \n\n\n\nIncorporated into our program is our Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled chemical release.  The EAP includes procedures for notification of local emergency responders.  The EAP is maintained current and updated periodically.\n\n\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the process and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is a retail supplier of various compressed gases for industrial, commercial, and medical use.  The facility is located at 2550 Kyle Crossing in Kyle, Texas.  The facility is situated approximately 0.1 miles "

These chemicals are stored in cylinders of varying sizes.  The cylinders are delivered to the facility on pallets either by an outside vendor or intercompany trucks. They are stored on or near the dock and remain onsite until purchased by a customer, at which point the intercompany truck picks up the cylinders for delivery to the customer. \n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory for each of the chemicals is listed as follows:\n\nAmmonia: 22,500 pounds\n\nChlorine: 6,720 pounds\n\nHydrogen Chloride: 6,835 pounds\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas has developed a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program to manage the handling of the regulated substances. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n1) Safety information that describes the chemical hazards and technical specifications for the process equipment;\n\n2) Written procedures for handling and inspecting the cylinders;\n\n3) Training for employees involved with cylinder handling and inspection;\n\n4) Written procedures for safely introducing modifications to the covered processes;\n\n5) Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence;\n\n6) Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the covered processes;\n\n7) Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises; and\n\n8) Employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering and administrative controls are implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  Most cylinders are equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization and rupture.  Detectors are installed in the dock area where the cylinders are stored to warn personnel of a leak.  The cylinders are inspected upon delivery, and any "

All other cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents onsite that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no releases of regulated substances that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities for each of the chemicals.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and outside emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for chemical exposure.  Employees perform evacuation drills and receive refresher training on the EAP.  In the event of a chemical release, the facility emergency coordinators will assess the situation and contact the fire department and the outside emergency response company (Specialized Response Solutions) for assistance.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the regulated processes, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.
