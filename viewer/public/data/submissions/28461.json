ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBayer Polymers LLC is committed to the principles of Responsible Care which emphasize operating in a safe and environmentally correct manner. Management systems are in place to assure all facilities are complying with these principles.  There are Corporate Engineering Standards and Health, Environment and Safety Guidelines which address every aspect of Risk Management from design of intrinsically safe processes and use of layers of protection to incident tracking and program audits. Bayer Polymers LLC a North American subsidiary of Bayer, AG, which is headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany.  Bayer Polymers LLC has its own corporate structure, policies and procedures which are consistent with those of the parent company, but are customized to meet US regulations and standards.  Bayer AG has established guidelines for Responsible Care in Environmental Protection and Safety, which includes a Directive for Process and Plant Safety that all Bayer facilities world-wide are expected to follow.  It provides guidance for safe process design and operation.\n\nIn the US, Bayer Polymers LLC is an active member of the American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care Initiative.  Bayer has implemented all seven codes of management practice which have been verified in practice by a third party audit.  Bayer Polymers LLC has a Corporate Health, Environment and Safety Policy which states that it is the corporation?s responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and communities.  This is a primary responsibility, of equal importance to any other business objective.

These include site Safety and Health Procedures, Emergency Response Procedures, Process Safety Management Procedures, Hazard Communication Procedure and Risk Management Procedure as well as safety plans in the individual production unit Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The Bayer Polymers LLC Addyston facility is ISO 14001 certified. \n\n2.  FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility manufactures plastics and resins.  The plastic pellet products are sold to molders for end use in refrigerator and automobile interiors, medical uses, computer housings, health spas, tools, and much more. The resins are used to coat circuit boards and coat aluminum cans to allow printing on the can.\n\nTwo RMP chemicals are used in the facility, acrylonitrile and butadiene.  These make up two of the three main chemicals used to make the plastic products.  (The third being styrene, a non-RMP chemical).  Acrylonitrile is a liquid and stored in 2 tanks prior to being used in smaller tanks and in several plastic manufacturing processes.  Butadiene is stored under pressure in a tank.  All storage tanks have concrete dike floors and walls capable of holding more than the quantity of the material being stored.  Multiple processes use these chemicals in various quantities in a process at one time.   Acrylonitrile is the only toxic RMP chemical and represents the worst case scenario for toxic chemicals.  Butadiene is the only flammable RMP chemical and thus represents the worst case flammable scenario.\n\n3A.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst case scenario for acrylonitrile assumes the following:\n- Greatest quantity of acrylonitrile is release from the largest storage tank over a 10 minute period\n- The release is into the concrete dike which "
