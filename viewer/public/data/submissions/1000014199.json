      "SummaryText": "In June 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized regulations for Section 112r of the Clean Air Act that required risk management planning to help prevent accidental releases of 139 hazardous and flammable substances. A Risk Management Plan (RMP) must be completed for facilities that process and/or store chemcials above the established threshold limits. The RMP details steps for prevention of possible accidents related to unintentiaonal chemical releases. Blue Island Phenol LLC has a RMP because the facility processes and stores propylene and propane above the established threshold quantities. This first RMP for JLM Chemicals Inc., the predecessor to Blue Island Phenol LLC, was completed in June 1999. This is the updated RMP plan, which reflects dates of current PSM activities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\nBlue Island Phenol LLC approaches accidental release prevention by participating in multiple safety programs that focus on prevention of explosions and fires and releases of regulated chemicals from the Cumene Process. The initial approach is accomplished through the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. The PSM program is designed to provide an overall framework of operating practices, procedures, and documentation to allow for the safe operation of the facility.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nBlue Island Phenol LLC is physically located in Alsip, Illinois, with a mailing address in Blue Island, Illinois. The facility consists of a Cumene Process, Phenol Process, and several chemical storage tanks. Benzene and propylene are reacted to form cumene and cumene hydroperoxide in the Cumene Process. The cumene is then utilized in the Phenol Process to produce phenol, acetone, and alpha methyl systrene. The only process at this facility subject to the RMP requirements is the production of cumene in the Cumene Process.  The chemicals in this process subject to the RMP requirements are propylene and pro"

      "SummaryText": "pane.\n\n The Cumene Process begins with Blue Island Phenol receiving a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) blend of propylene/propane either by railroad cars or tank trucks. The blend can range from 71% propylene to 99.9% propylene. The LPG (as a raw material) is fed directly into the Cumene Process area or to a storage tank (with a maximum capacity of 162,000 lbs.) for later use. In the Cumene Unit, the propylene is reacted with benzene to produce cumene, an intermediate product used in the production of phenol and acetone, The propane does not undergo a chemical reaction and is subsequently removed from the process in the depropanizer. The propane is then either sold as a product or used internally as fuel. The RMP threshold quantities for propylene and propane are 10,000 lbs each. The amounts of propylene and propane onsite at Blue Island Phenol LLC both exceed that threshold, and therefore, an RMP is necessary. Both chemicals are considered flammable, but not toxic.\n\nAccidental Releae Prevention Steps\nThe following are accidental release prevention programs and safety programs that Blue Island Phenol LLC has implemented to prevent accidental releases of propylene and/or propane:\n1. Process Safety Management (PSM) Program in order to meet the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.\nElements of the PSM Program were reviewd relative to the RMP Program requirements.\n2. Employee Particiapation Program\n3. Ongoing compilation and an update of process safety information\n4. Management of Change Program\n5. Pre-Startup Safety Review Program\n6. Hot Work Permit Program\n7. Continued Employee Training\n8. Ongoing Maintenance Program to insure mechanical integrity of equipment and processes using a computerized tracking system.\n9. VOC leak detection and repair program for pumps and valves. The Program requires that pumps be monitored monthly and valves be monitored quarterly for leaks.\n10. Safety valves to avoid overpressure\n11. Routine equipment checks by employess\n12. Excess flow valves o"

      "SummaryText": "n railcars and storage tank #903 to stop flow in case of a line break\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have not been any releases of propylene or propane from the Cumene Process within the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, of known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environemental damage. This is the only process (due to the propylene and propane components) that is subject to the RMP requirements at Blue Island Phenol LLC.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nBlue Island Phenol LLC has its own Emergency Response Program for the facility. When the alarm is activated, Blue Island Phenol LLC employees that make up the fire brigade will respond. A fire truck, foam trailer, six monitors, fire hydrants, and fire extingusihers are located on site for fire emergencies. In addition, Blue Island Phenol LLC has two independent fire pumps for emergencies. The electric fire pump is fed city water and the diesel fire pump is fed canal water. Blue Island Phenol has also made arrangements with local fire departments for emergency response procedures. The Alsip Fire Department has primary responsibility to respond to emergencies at Blue Island Phenol LLC. The Blue Island Fire Department and other fire departments in the area are expected to respond to emergencies at the facility if necessary. Both the Alsip Fire Department and the Blue Island Fire Department can be contacted by phone (regular or dedicated phone line) and by radio, These communications devices are located in the Control Room at Blue Island Phenol LLC. The local and emergency response alarms are tested once a week.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIn order to improve safety near the LPG storage tanks, Blue Island Phenol plans on installing gas detection monitors (with alarms) at the storage tank and railcar unloading rack. A flammable gas detection system is also being evaluated.\n"
