This commitment  is  demonstrated  by  our\n\ncomprehensive  accidental release prevention  program  that  covers\n\nareas   such   as   design,  installation,  operating   procedures,\n\nmaintenance and employee training associated with the processes  at\n\nour  facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate  controls\n\nto prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur  facility's  primary activities encompass  the  manufacture  of\n\nsweeteners,  corn syrups, ethanol, and propanediol  utilizing  corn\n\nwet  milling  and  fermentation processes.  Tate  &  Lyle  has  two\n\nregulated  substances at our facility.  The substances  are  Sulfur\n\nDioxide   (anhydrous)  and  Ammonia  (anhydrous).   Sulfur  Dioxide\n\n(anhydrous)  is  used to control microbial growth during  the  corn\n\nsteeping  process and also weakens the starch-gluten bonds  so  the\n\nseparation  process following steeping is more efficient.   Ammonia\n\n(anhydrous) is used as an ingredient in the fermentation process to\n\nproduce propanediol.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia at our facility\n\nis 144,000 pounds and 65,000 pounds, respectively.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternate release scenarios, Tate  &\n\nLyle  utilized  the  EPA's  RMP Guidance for  Wastewater  Treatment\n\nPlants.   The  following paragraphs provide details of  the  chosen\n\nscenarios.\n\n\n\nTHE SULFUR DIOXIDE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO submitted involves a\n\ncatastrophic release from the Sulfur Dioxide storage tank.  In this\n\nscenario  144,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is  released\n\nin  a  gaseous  form  over  10 minutes.   At  class  F  atmospheric\n\nstability,  1.5  m/s  wind speed and urban topography  the  maximum\n\ndistance  of 13 m"

The scenario involves the release  of\n\n18,000  pounds  of  Sulfur Dioxide.  The existing controls  prevent\n\nbulk tank losses.  The operator and the truck driver monitoring the\n\ntruck  unloading will require up to 30 minutes to stop the release.\n\nThe  toxic  gas will be released to the atmosphere with no  passive\n\nmitigation  to  control  the release rate.  Under  neutral  weather\n\nconditions  of class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s  wind  speed\n\nand  assuming  urban topography the maximum distance to  the  toxic\n\nendpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur Dioxide is 0.4 miles.\n\n\n\nTHE  AMMONIA  WORST  CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO  submitted  involves  a\n\ncatastrophic  release  from  the Ammonia  storage  tank.   In  this\n\nscenario  65,000  pounds of Ammonia (anhydrous) is  released  in  a\n\ngaseous  form  over 10 minutes.  At class F atmospheric  stability,\n\n1.5 m/s wind speed and urban topography the maximum distance of 3.1\n\nmiles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nTHE AMMONIA ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves sending a charge of\n\nAmmonia  to  an empty fermentor when no dextrose is present.   This\n\nscenario  would  release  200 pounds of Ammonia  over  20  minutes.\n\nUnder  neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric  stability\n\nand  3  m/s  wind speed and assuming urban topography, the  maximum\n\ndistance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-\n\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nTate  &  Lyle has taken all the necessary steps to comply with  the\n\naccidental  release prevention requirements set out  under  40  CFR\n\npart 68 of the EPA.
