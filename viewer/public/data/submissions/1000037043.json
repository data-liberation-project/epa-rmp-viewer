Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nEnvironmental protection and enhancement are essential elements of TVA's integrated resource management mission.\r\nTVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified river and power system for multiple public\r\nbenefits, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power. TVA is committed to setting the standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee Valley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management. TVA assures that employees are aware of their\r\nenvironmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance.\r\n\r\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and\r\nstriving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through proper environmental review of new\r\ndevelopments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness. All activities will be\r\nconducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe affected facility consists of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility including four 30,000 gallon storage tanks with\r\nsupporting unloading equipment, liquid transfer pumps, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert\r\nammonia from a liquid to a vapor, an ammonia vapor transport line, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject\r\nammonia into a selective catalytic reduction emission control system.\r\n\r\nThere is only one regulated substance at the facility \u00bf anhydrous ammonia. With four 30,000 gallon storage tanks, the\r\nmaximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 533"

Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and\r\nmitigation measures to limit the distances to the end point for each reported scenario, were developed. To perform the\r\nrequired offsite consequence analysis for the facility, the very conservative EPA RMP*Comp model was used.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves the complete rupture of one 30,000 gallon storage tank. A maximum release of\r\n133,350 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered. The released quantity has not been\r\nlimited by a system of administrative controls. Under worst case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5\r\nm/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite end point concentrations impacting populated areas.\r\n\r\nThe alternative case release scenario with the worst credible case offsite impact involves the release of 133,350 pounds of ammonia vapor loss from the failure of a 3-inch liquid ammonia line attache to the bottom of the 30,000 gallon tank.  Under typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the ammonia vapor would have offsite toxic end point levels.\r\n\r\nIV. Description of Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards, operating\r\nparameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis: TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure that hazards associated with\r\nthe process were identified and controlled effectively. The Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis\r\nmethodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified\r\npersonnel with expertise in engineering, control log"

The HAZOP analysis was conducted on August 13-15, 2001and April 16-17, 2003 and a pre-startup HAZOP\r\nreview was conducted on December 10, 2003.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within our\r\ncovered process. The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal\r\nshutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or\r\nemergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the\r\nprocess and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\r\n\r\nTraining: TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the\r\noperation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and\r\nknowledgeable of the hazards of the process. The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and\r\nreliable operations. All process equipment routinely checked includes storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems,relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices. All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change: TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures\r\nand monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory requirements.

Established prestartup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine whether the\r\nprovisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The audits will be conducted at least every 3 years and\r\nany corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigations:  Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated. Procedures ensure that investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the situation surrounding the release does not reoccur.  All reports will be retained for at least 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: TVA believes in a team approach to process safety management and accident prevention.\r\nEmployees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend\r\nimprovements.

Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere was an accident on June 3, 2014 necessitating this correction. \r\n\r\nVI. Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes\r\nall aspects of emergency response plan requirements including adequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-inplace locations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency response plan. In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep employees, contractors, and local responders familiar with the plan.\r\n\r\nVII. Five Year Update\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the process hazard analyis of the ammonia storage and handling systems for all TVA facilities are reviewed in detail prior to the five-year anniversary of the original submission of the RMPs.  An audit was conducted August 29, 2013 for the purpose of revalidating the Kingston Fossil Plant ammonia process hazard analysis.  An audit of Kingston's RMP was completed on October 18, 2012, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.  This submittal was due to an accidental release on June 3, 2014 for which a correction to the RMP was required.  In the submittal, the 5-yr accident history was updated as required."
