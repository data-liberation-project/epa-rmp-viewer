Safety information is readily available, and is updated when changes are made, in accordance with management of change procedures.  A variety of technical documents are used to facilitate safe operation of the processes.  The documents address limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The HS&E Department oversees the generation, management, and tracking of PSM related information.  The appropriate department, such as operations, maintenance, engineering, or inspection handles specific types of information.\r\n\r\n*Most process safety information required by the PSM standard is available in the PSM database located on the refinery local area network.  For information not found in the database, a referral to its location is provided.  The majority of information not housed by the HS&E Department can be found in the engineering/technical department or in the mechanical integrity department.  \r\n\r\n*Manuals containing operating procedures and process unit descriptions are available online in the PSM database, and in hard copy at several locations.  Operating Instructions are certified annually.\r\n\r\n*Material safety data sheets for all products and chemicals used or produced at the refinery are available from the PSM database or on the company intranet MSDS website.\r\n\r\n*Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) for a process unit can be found in the control room and Operations Superintendent's office for that unit.

The PSM database offers access to Refinery Safe Work Practices and Refinery Safety Policies and Procedures.   \r\n\r\nThe HS&E Department assumes overall responsibility for the development and enforcement of Refinery Safe Work Practices and Safety Policies and Procedures.  Front line enforcement of safe work practices are the responsibility of the area supervisors and craft foreman.  Premcor expects each employee be responsible for his or her own safety, as well as the safety of his or her coworkers.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nAny modification that creates a change in existing process safety information must go through a documented process of verification.  The management of change (MOC) process is a system of checks and balances intended to ensure that each department involved in the planning, installation, and operation of the modified process has reviewed the change.  The process also ensures that all affected process safety information is updated to reflect the change, and that the safety of the modification has been evaluated before startup.  \r\n\r\nThe management of change process is initiated when an originator fills out an MOC form, which describes the change and provides justification for the project.  The MOC form identifies and documents the following:\r\n\r\n* The technical basis for the change\r\n* The impact of the change on safety and health\r\n* The necessary revisions to process safety information\r\n* Completion of a pre-startup safety review\r\n* Approval from the"

      "SummaryText": "eveloped a Contractor Safety Program to satisfy and exceed PSM guidelines by extending plant safety requirements to non-Premcor employees working within the refinery.  The Program is intended to maintain a plant-wide, consistent level of safe work performance. The HS&E Department is responsible for enforcing the Contractor Safety Program.  Such enforcement involves not only the contractor's responsibilities, but also Premcor's obligations under paragraph (h) of the PSM standard.  This program has resulted in the contractors at this site going 2524 days (as of 9/22/06) without a lost time accident.  The Contractor Safety Program includes the following:\r\n\r\n* Requires contract bidders to provide information on accident rates and the contractor's safety programs.\r\n* Requires the contractor to verify each employee's knowledge of job safety, craft skills, and equipment operation before assignment to onsite work.\r\n* Restricts bid requests to those contractors who have satisfied minimum requirements.  Those requirements include reviewing of their OSHA 300 log, a documented drug screening program, comprehensive Safety Action Plan, and English fluency for employees performing safety-sensitive work.  Contractors supply information on ISNETWORLD and receive a rating which is used to determine if they can become an approved contractor.  Contractor employees working in the refinery must comply with the requirements for 8 hours of specific safety training conducted through the Tennessee Valley Training Center or a reciprocal safety training center.\r\n* Establishes pre-job meetings, pre-job safety orientation conference, and site-specific orientation before actual work begins to ensure that the contractor and contract employees fully understand the safety policies and requirements of the Memphis Refinery.  Contractors are expected to follow the Memphis Refinery Safe Work Practices.\r\n* Assigns ultimate responsibility to contractors for their employees' safety.  Safety responsibilit"
