After problems are evaluated, repairs or replacement of the chlorine cylinder can be made. We must insure that the chlorine room is ventilated and that all personnel in the area have SCBA's and protective clothing.No one is to enter the area alone,trained personnel must be standing by to make all repairs using an approved repair kit.\n\n    B) Major leaks:\n? Notify the fire department and chief operator immediately.\n? Evacuate the area.\n? Enact emergency calling.\n? After assessing the severity of the leak, make public notification.\n\nPreventive Measures\n\n    A) Training- All personnel must have adequate training in all areas of chlorine handling.\n    B)Ventilation- Chlorine storage areas must have adequate and well maintained ventilators.\n    C) Alarms-Chlorine storage and usage areas must have well maintained alarm systems.\n    D)Communication- All problems, no matter how small, must be communicated.\n    \nReceiving Of Chlorine Shipments\n\n    Shipments of chlorine are receivied via an outdoor loading/unloading dock. Immediately after receiving,full cylinders are moved into a chlorine area(room), were they are used one at a time. The protective end caps are not removed untill the time of use. The hoist that moves the cylinders is regularly inspected by certified repair persons to insure safety.",

Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  prepare  and  implement  an  Risk  Management  Plan  in  conformance  with  40  CFR  68,  published  June  20, 1996 ( EPA # 550-Z96-002).\n\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR CHLORINE SAFETY\n\nAll  operators  are instructed  to  read , study  and  understand  the  chlorine  manual  supplied  to  them  by  the  chlorine  institute. The  manual  contains  detailed  information  on  the  safe  usage  of  chlorine  and  chlorine  products.\n    Inhalation  of  chlorine  gas , leaking  from  one  ton  containers,  connections,  or  piping  can  cause  serious  respiratory  tract  irritation  or  injury, unconsciousness,  or  death  due  to  chlorine  poisoning.  For  this  reason  chlorine  storage  containers  and  piping (except  solution  piping ) are  confined  to  the  chlorine  applications  room.  This  room is equipped  with a separate  outside  entrance  and  exhaust  system  that  automatically  comes  on  when:\n1) Doors  are opened\n2) The light switch is turned on.\n3) The outside switch is turned on\n4) The chlorine gas detector sounds an alarm.\nThe  air  in  the  room  is continuously  monitored, if  gas  concentrations  reach  1.0  ppm  an  alarm  is  sounded  outside  the  room, on  the  main  control  panel  and  the  exhaust  fans  start. There  are  observation  windows  so  outside  personnel  can  monitor  work  going  on  inside  the  chlorine  room.. Self  contained  breathing  apparatus,  and  protective  clothing , are  worn  by  all personnel  while  working  inside  the  chlorine  room.\n\n\nPRECAUTIONS  FOR  CHLORINE  HANDLING\n\nA) Chlorine  must  be  handled  by  trained  personnel.\n\nB) Ton  cylin"

All  chlorine  connections  should  be  checked  for  leaks, any  leaks  detected,  no  matter  how  small,  must  be  isolated  and  repaired  immediately.\n\nF) Always  open  chlorine  valves  slowly  and  carefully  while  using  a  standard  chlorine  valve  wrench. Chlorine  valves  need  to be  turned  only  one  full  turn  counter-clockwise  to  permit  maximum  chlorine  discharge  from  the  cylinder.A  stuck  chlorine  valve  can  usually  be  opened  by  striking  the  end  of  the  valve  wrench  with  the  heel  of  the  hand. If  a  valve  does  not  open  in  this  manner, return  the  cylinder  to  the  supplier  for  replacement.\n\nG) When  not  withdrawing  chlorine  or  when  a  cylinder  is  empty, the  valve  must  be  closed  off.\n\nH) Chlorine  containers  must  be  changed  as  soon  as  they  become  empty.\n\nI) When  a  leak  is  detected ,  personnel  entering  the  chlorine  room  must  always  don  protective  clothing  and  a  respiratory  protective  device (SCBA) before  entering  to  perform  work..\n\nJ) Never  store  containers  in  direct  sun  light  or  near  sources  of  direct  heat.\n\nK) Storage  room  temperatures  should  be  approximately  70 degrees  Fahrenheit.\n\nL) Chlorine  containers  must  NEVER  be  used  for  storing  anything  except  chlorine.\n\nM) Chlorine  safety  instructions, regarding  the  handling  of  cylinders,  must  be  posted  on  the  safety  bulletin  board  and  in  the  chlorine  room.\n\n\nEDUCATION\n\n    Only  trained  personnel  are  allowed  to  handle  chlorine. Training  comes  from  several  sources,  These  sources  are:\n\nA)  The  New  York  State  Dept.  Of   Environmental  Conservation  includes  chlorine  safety  training  along  with  there  "

Our  excellent  safety  record  is  the  result  of  an  excellent  safety  program, which  have  been  developed  through  countless  hours  of  training  and  diligence.\n\n\nFIRST  RESPONDERS \n\n\n    Since  police  agencies  are  often  dispatched  before  the  nature  of  the  problem  is  known, police  personnel  are  likely  to  be  the  first  emergency  services  at  the  scene  of  an  incident  involving  a  chlorine  release. They  may  arrive  before  fire  or  other  emergency  agencies.If  the  police  officer  is  the  first  on  the  scene  of  a hazardous  materials  accident  he/she  will  need  to  identify  the  chemical  involved  in  the  release. Many  chemicals  can  be  lethal  and  explosions  can  occur  before  fire  departments  reach  the  scene. The  police  officer  may  have  to  make  decisions  which  will  affect  the  lives  and  safety  of  a  great  number  of  people.\n\nPHASES  OF  EMERGENCY  RESPONSE\n\n\n    The  response  to, and  control  of, any  emergency  situation  can  be  broken  down  into  several  phases. The  basic  phases  of    response  to  a  hazardous  materials  incident  involving  chlorine  would  include:\n1) Receipt of  notification  of  the  incident.\n2) Initial  response.\n3) Arrival "

Depending  on  the  situation,  consideration  may  have  to  be  given  to  wind  direction, terrain, blocked  access  and  other  factors.  Approach  from  upwind  whenever  possible, even  if  it  means  a  detour.  Try  to  keep  apparatus  and  personnel  uphill  from  the  incident. In  case  of  ignition  of  vapors, do  not  place  apparatus  close  enough  to  be  damaged. Keep  all  unnecessary  personnel  out  of  the  area.\n    Life  safety  must  be  the  prime  consideration  when  making  decisions  at  the  scene  of  a  hazard  materials  incident   involving  chlorine. Safety  of  rescue  personnel  must  be  assured  since  injury  to  firefighters  will  compound  the  problem.  The  officer  in  charge  must  size  up the  situation  and  determine  if  the  situation  can  be  controlled, if  it  cannot  the  decision  must  be  made  to  evacuate  the  area  designated  in  the  worst  case  scenario."
