In addition it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nThe facility maintains approximately 22-1000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 103,000 pounds.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in 2 stationary storage tanks, 1 -12,000 gallon tank and 1 -11,000 gallon tank on site.  108,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 211,000 pounds.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 56,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 12,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), is released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.

The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure required a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted Canova Coop has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility  complies with all applicable federal , state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of  ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.   Liquid and  vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary.\n\nThe general manager utilizes a  checklist survey form that is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state, and  local regulations are covered.

Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to the grower customer in 1000-gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia to the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  Ammonia may also be used for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Training is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency and regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.    \n\nThe emergency response program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.
