Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Evergreen FS, Inc. - Blue Mound Facility are committed to the prevention of any release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with of the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors. The maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at the facility would be 303758 pounds, this would include 1- rail car, the fixed storage tanks and nurse tanks normally stored there.\n\n3. The accidental release program.\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's Accidnetal Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implimented the provision of Safety Requirements for the Storage & Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by the state regulation and standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n4. Five-year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deathes, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accord"
