This will be accomplished at all facilities by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough Process Safety Management program and complete safety training.\n\nThe Process Safety Management program will be managed by a corporate team, but completed on a facility basis under the specific direction of the facility manager.  The program will conform to OSHA regulations contained in 29 CFR Part 1910.  Sinclair Oil Corporation has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program by May 1997.  Sinclair Oil Corporation will update the Safety Management Program every five years thereafter.  Emphasis will be placed on managing the higher risk areas of our facilities first, the priority of which will be established by each facility team.\n\nStatement of the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery. \n\nThe Management of the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both the refinery and the local community. Our policy is to ensure that our efforts with prevention through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance, and communication with our neighbors will help us prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery includes modern process units typically used for production of petroleum fuels: atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, reforming, fluidized catalytic cracking, alkylation, and associated supporting operati"

The NAICS  code for the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery is 32411 and must meet the requirements of RMP Program Level 3.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities. For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\" (re: 40 CFR 68.3)\n\nPer the RMP definition, the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has the following RMP regulated flammables in its processes:\nPentane\nButane\nIsobutane\nPropane\nEthane\nMethane\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery also has the following regulated toxins in its Processes:\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S)\nChlorine (Cl2)\nSulfur Dioxide (S02)\nOf the above substances, only pentane, butane, and propane meet the RMP threshold quantity level for flammables.  Only chlorine meets the RMP threshold quantity level for toxics.\n\nBased upon threshold quantities and process definition, the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery is reporting the following three processes in its RMP:\nC4 Mixture: This represents a butane/butene mix in storage.  The maximum quantity of C4 Mixture onsite at any time is estimated to be 26,000,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C4 Mixture with an allowance for piping and material in process.

The Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has multiple processes, which contain H2S and SO2.  The maximum quantity of H2S and SO2 on site does not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Therefore, these compounds do not meet RMP threshold levels.  However, we do have prevention and safety programs in place for all H2S-handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nWorst Case Scenario-Flammables: The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest tank containing C4 \nMixture.  Tank 668 has a capacity of 30,000 bbls and is also the closest tank to an offsite receptor.  For the WCS, the full tank inventory of 6,000,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.5 miles (as calculated by RMP*Comp.).  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, we took no credit for passive mitigation measures in evaluating the WCS.  It is important to note the WCS is based upon the simultaneous occurrence of several highly unlikely events, therefore the probability of the WCS actually occurring is extremely low.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Flammables: The alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery is based upon the failure of a flexible hose used to load butane into tank trucks.  For this scenario, the quantity of butane released was based upon the maximum pump capacity of 305 gpm over a 60-minute interval or 92,000 lbs.  As with the WCS, we assumed all liquid would vaporize and ignite resulting in a VCE.  The distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.2 mile (as calculated by RMP*Comp.)."

WCS-2 is a release of chlorine from a chlorine bullet tank at the River Pump Station. For both WCS, a full bullet tank inventory of 2,000 pounds is assumed to release within 10 minutes.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this WCS is 3.0 miles (as calculated by RMP*Comp). It is important to note the WCS is based upon highly unlikely events, therefore the probability of the WCS actually occurring is extremely low.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Toxics: There are two ARS for toxic substances at this facility. ARS-1and ARS-2 are based upon the mechanical failure of a thermal plug which is located in the dished-head of the chlorine bullet tank. For these scenario, the release rate of chlorine is based upon the maximum flowrate through the thermal plug orifice.  For modeling purposes, this flowrate was maintained until the bullet tank was emptied.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for both ARS-1 and ARS-2 is 1.0 miles (as calculated by DEGADIS).\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents.  While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery.

The Technical Manager's office includes all information about the HAZOP analysis, team members, recommendations, and resolutions.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sinclair Wyoming Refinery updates and revalidated the hazard analysis results.  The revalidation team consists of the same types of personnel that the initial HAZOP does. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue on that schedule until the unit is no longer operating or is removed.  Revalidated hazard analysis results are tracked, submitted for management review, and retained and documented until they are complete. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery maintains written procedures for all operations functions at the refinery.

Maintenance personnel receive refresher training though the certifications required for inspection and testing.  Personnel are required to take the necessary certification training and tests on the appropriate schedule to keep current.\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery also trains personnel in safety, emergency response, and HAZOP.  Safety and emergency response training takes place at least yearly, where local emergency response personnel from the local communities join our onsite emergency personnel for coordinated training.  This training ensures that our local emergency response groups are familiar with our facility and get to know our people and our capabilities.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as quality assurance by requiring verification that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The completed and signed PSSR checklist is included in the PSM files.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures for testing and inspecting help ensure that the work is performed consistently and provides a basis for training.\n\nPersonnel perform inspections and tests to ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, if possible, or the refinery's Management of Change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Sinclair also integrates quality assurance within its mechanical integrity program by ensuring all equipment purchases and repairs are up to code and per specification.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nThe Sinclair Wyoming Refinery's inspection and testing personnel are certified to the proper standards and have current training certificates on file.
