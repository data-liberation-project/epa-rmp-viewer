The facility operates 24 hours a day, three hundred and sixty five days a year.\r\n\r\nThe site consists of 155 acres, of which 39 acres are filled with river dredging and are currently developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a 720-foot dock of wood construction on the Columbia River.   All activities on this dock are controlled and regulated by the United States Coast Guard, who has issued the facility a certificate of adequacy for reception facilities.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\nThere are 141 regulated substances by the RPM.   Of these, only acetaldehyde is present on the plant site above its threshold quantity (10,000 pounds).\r\n\r\nAcetaldehyde is used in the manufacture of Cinnamon oil (cinnamic aldehyde) which is the major component of cinnamon flavoring.   Because cinnamic aldehyde is not manufactured continuously on the site, acetaldehyde is only on the plant site during cinnamic aldehyde production.   The maximum amount of \r\nacetaldehyde on the plant site is limited to 46,872 pounds (7,200 gallons), which is 90% of the volume of its storage tank. \r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Process Description"

      "SummaryText": "Acetaldehyde is purchased in single tank truckload shipments and is off loaded using nitrogen into a nitrogen padded, insulated storage tank.   The acetaldehyde is blended with another raw material in a mix tank one batch at a time, and then the mixture is fed to a reactor where it is converted into cinnamic aldehyde.   Each batch is made using an excess of the other raw material to ensure that during the reaction step all of the acetaldehyde is converted into cinnamic aldehyde.\r\n\r\nThe storage tank, mix tank, and reactor all vent through a common header to a water scrubber for control of acetaldehyde vapors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario\r\nAs dictated by 40 CFR 68.25(e) for flammables, the Worst Case Release Scenario (WCS) would be if the total amount of acetaldehyde in the storage tank is released, vaporized, ignited and involved in a vapor cloud explosion.    Using the formula dictated by the EPA's RMP rule this would require the acetaldehyde storage tank to BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion), resulting in an offsite impact.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Controls to Limit the Impact Distance\r\nSee the corresponding section under the Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for the administrative controls used here to limit the impact distance of this WCS.\r\n\r\nMitigation Measures to Limit the Impact Distance\r\nSee the corresponding section under the Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for the mitigation measures used to limit the impact distance of this WCS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe Kalama plant Acetaldehyde Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was used as the principal source for Alternate Release Scenarios (ARS).   The PHA utilized Fault Tree analysis based on a catastrophic release of acetaldehyde.\r\n\r\nCandidate ARSs from the PHA were screened to establish the most likely scenario according to impact, quantity, offsite impact, fuel source, ignition source, severity, and likelihood.

To establish the most likely percent of the worst case scenario to be used as the ARS a review of the most likely tank level at which a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion) would occur was done.   This review yielded a 50% tank level.   Therefore, the Alternate Release Scenario was found to be a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion) of the acetaldehyde storage tank, containing 23,436 pounds (3,600 gallons) of acetaldehyde, caused by a fire impinging on the non-insulated, outside wall of the tank.   Using the formula dictated by the EPA's RMP rule the resulting BLEVE would have an offsite impact.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Controls to Limit the Impact Distance\r\nPrior to making any transfers into or out of the tank the operator is to inspect the tank, transfer lines, and the receiving vessel for integrity to insure that there are no worn or damaged parts.   In addition, the operator is to check that the receiving vessel has the empty space in it to receive the full amount of the intended transfer quantity without going over 90% in the receiving tank.\r\n\r\nDuring tank truck offloading and transfer operations an operator has to be present walking around inspecting for leaks.\r\n\r\nThere is a mechanical integrity program at the facility that checks and tests the instrumentation and loss prevention systems (i.e. PSV, fire valve, fire suppression systems, fire water supply system, vessel and pipe thickness testing, etc.)\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program exists at the facility, which assesses the process every time there is a change and every five years if there are no changes.\r\n\r\nThere is a Management of Change (MOC) system at the facility, which insures that when a revision of any kind is done w"
