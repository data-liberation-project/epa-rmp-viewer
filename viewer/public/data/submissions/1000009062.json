The emergency response program dictates roles and responsibilities and actions to be taken in the event of an accidental release.  These are kept in the RMP binder onsite.\n2745.3 (b)  PPI handles Toluene Diisocyanate & Isophorone Diisocyanate as regulated materials.\n2745.3 (c)  PPI emergency response program dictates best practices for handling of regulated materials, and spill response procedures.  The program also outlines standard operating procedures for each task related to the handling of the regulated materials.  This can be found in the RMP binder located at the facility.\n2745.3 (d)   PPI has had no accidental releases of any regulated material in the previous five (5) years.\n2745.3 (e)  The PPI emergency response program includes coordination between on site, emergency responders and contracted clean up companies.  The institutional controls at the site are sufficient to prevent off site impacts of the regulated materials, so any release will be on onsite spill response.  Our emergency plan dictates roles and responsibilities and actions to be taken by personnel on site.  Training on the plan is held annually for all employees, and periodic drills are conducted.\n2745.3 (f)  PPI takes the safety of its employees and the public very seriously.  Safety policies and procedures are reviewed constantly and changed in accordance with identified deficiencies.  PPI employees a full time Environment, Health & Safety Manager to provide safety direction, training and evaluation to the corporation.  Safety huddles with all employees are conducted weekly, and formal safety training occurs monthly on a number of safety and environmental related topics.  At this time there are no significant plans to change any specific safety program or pr"
