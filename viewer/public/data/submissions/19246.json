      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been developed for Ballard Exploration Company, Inc. (Ballard). in accordance with 40 CFR part 68.  The Buxton Creek Field Facilities is subject to the requirements of this program due to the manufacturing and storage of natural gas liquids (approximately 90% propane) in an amount greater than 10,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is located approximately 6 miles south of De Quincy, Louisiana at the intersection of Route 66 and Marcantel Rd. within Calcasieu Parish. The area surrounding the facility is sparsely populated and used primarily for oil and gas exploration and production purposes.  The latitude and longitude of the facility was obtained using a hand-held Garmin 75 GPS device with an accuracy of +/-100 meters.  The facility can be located on the USGS quadrangle map entitled Brimstone, LA.\n\nThe facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and condensate/oil from various field wells.  High pressure gas from the wells is sent through a glycol contact tower for drying and is then routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  It is then routed through a water knockout vessel before being sent through a propane heat exchanger where the gas temperature is lowered from approximately 70oF to 20oF.  Condensed liquids are dumped to a stabilizer vessel where the product is heated to approximately 85oF by circulating a coolant inhibitor.  The final NGL product from the stabilizer vessel is dumped to a 30,000 gallon pressurized tank and is eventually sold to and hauled by tank truck.  NGL is a mixture of propane, butane, pentane and other heavier hydrocarbons.  The natural gas and oil that is produced at the facility is sold by pipeline and hauled by tank truck, respectively.\n\nSince propane is the predominant (approximately 90%) substance in NGL with the highest heat of combustion, the properties of the mixture are assumed to be similar to that of propane.  The threshold quantity for flammable substances under 40 CFR part 68 i"

      "SummaryText": "s 10,000 lbs. According to the facility operator, there may be periods when 100% of the storage tank capacity is utilized (30,000 gallons).  According the Gas Processors Suppliers Association's Engineering Data Book Volume II the liquid density of  propane is 4.2268 lbs./gal.  Based on this information the facility stores a maximum of 126,804 lbs. of NGL.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)-Determination of worst-case release quantity. This type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic natural or other unforeseen disaster, such as total tank failure as well as the failure of all installed safety devices.  The entire quantity released was assumed to have formed a vapor cloud explosion, which then detonated.  The one pound per square inch overpressure endpoint for this scenario is the threshold for potential serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris and other explosion effects.  A release of 126,804 lbs. of NGL for a duration of 10 minutes in the form of a vapor cloud explosion results in a 0.4 mile distance to the endpoint.  According to USGS maps, aerial photographs and operator knowledge of the surrounding area there are no public or environmental receptors within a 0.4-mile radius of the facility. The nearest known public receptor is a private residence located approximately 0.6 mile east of the facility. \n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a program 1 site.  The 30,000-gallon storage tank is equipped with three pressure relief valves venting to the atmosphere that automatically operates according to preset pressure specifications.\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release that caused on or off site injury, death or property damage within the past five years.  \n\nA prevention program is not required for this facility.  As a prudent operator Ballard is aware of the General Duty Clause"

The facility has not experienced an accidental release that caused death, injury or property damage within the past five years.\n2. The distance to the flammable endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor\n3.
