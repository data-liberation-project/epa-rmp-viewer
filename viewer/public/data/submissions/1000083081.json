Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Combee Water Treatment Plant (Combee Plant) is part of Water Utilities a division of the City of Lakeland, Florida. The City of Lakeland requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training.\n\n\n\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Combee Plant is located at 2450 Old Combee Road in the northeast corner of Lakeland, Florida. The plant consists of filtration, clarification, fluoridation and purification processes that treat drinking water for the City of Lakeland. \n\n\n\nThe Combee Plant adds chlorine to the filtered water as a purification agent. The chlorination process is located in an enclosed building at the center of the property, where liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to four one-ton containers.  Two containers are always connected to the chlorination system, and up to two are stored nearby.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time ranges from 4,000 to 8,000 lbs.  This exceeds the 2,500-lb. Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe City of Lakeland considers its processes as subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and has implemented a PSM program at all facilities which have PSM listed processes.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Combee Plant process in the Program 3 level.  The Combee facility implemented the PSM program as required by the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe Combee Plant has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management "

      "SummaryText": "Standard, 29 CFR 1919.119.  The PSM Program was established in 2005 for the chlorine process.  The program includes written operating procedures, preventative maintenance, and employee training to ensure safe operation of the chlorine process. The PSM Program receive full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination process is located in an enclosed building that includes a scrubber capable of filtering up to one ton and process-area chlorine detectors which will set off alarms if a release of chlorine is detected. Chlorine gas flows from the container under vacuum.  Under normal operation, therefore, the chlorine gas is delivered under vacuum through pipe to the chlorine injection points.  If the vacuum is lost, the diaphragm in the vacuum regulator closes, stopping the flow of chlorine gas at the vacuum regulator.  This helps to prevent uncontrolled chlorine releases.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the written prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA PSM regulation and the EPA RMP rule, and includes but is not limited to:\n\n?    Formal and on-the-job training, \n\n?    Written operating procedures, and \n\n?    A process equipment preventive maintenance program.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Combee Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs with the Prevention Program, the Combee Plant has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The current plans have been coordinated with the Polk County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the District 7 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facil"
