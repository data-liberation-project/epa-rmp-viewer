During the delivery event, an operator is present to supervise the proper exchange of rail cars.\nThe monitors are made of an electrolytic cell design Spare cells are maintained at the facility. The monitors are located at each bleach unit, the two (2) rail car unloading stations and on the chlorine line near the middle of the length from the rail cars to the bleach unit, The chlorine monitor is colocated with the automatic shut-off valve, The other automatic shut off valves are located at the bleach unit and at the rail car station. The two (2) chlorine expansion chambers are located on the chlorine line on either side of the automatic shut-off valve.  Another shut-off valve is going to be added by the door of the rail car unloading area for emergency responders. The monitors are set to activate the automatic shut-off valves and sound an alarm at or above a concentration of one (1) part per million (ppm) of chlorine, Each monitor at the rail cars and the monitor at the chlorine line are designed to shut down the system Scenario: If one (1) at a rail car senses chlorine at or above a concentration of one (1) ppm, the automatic shut-off valves activate at the rail car location and at the chlorine line.  Scenario #2: The monitor at the bleach unit activates only the automatic shut-off valve at the bleach unit.  The purpose of this arrangement is to take advantage of the expansion capacity of the rail car and the bleach unit.\nThe chlorine expansion chambers built into the chlorine line are provided to allow for gas expansion in the event of an automatic system shut down.

KIK also has a plastics blow molding operation, making all of their containers for their products.  There are several chemicals stored in bulk at the facility; Caustic, Chlorine, and High Density Polyethylene. The finished products are typically stored in one (1) gallon or smaller polyethylene bottles, and packaged in cardboard cases for shipment to retail outlets.  These cases are palletized for ease of handling and shipment.  KIK has an on-site wastewater treatment facility for the management of miscellaneous aqueous streams.\nThe primary goal of the Risk Management Program is to prevent or reduce the risk of accidental releases of substances that might expose employees, the public, or the environment to the hazards of toxicity, tire or explosion. Our policy is to implement the prevention measures outlined in the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations by focusing on the standards, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or equipment. As with any prevention program, one of the most important barriers to an incident is the performance and conduct of our people in integrating program requirements and safe work practices in their daily activities.\nThe only regulated substance at the facility meeting the threshold quantity as determined under 68115 subject to the Risk Management Program is: Chlorine KIK Louisiana, Inc. receives 90 ton rail cars which are connected directly to the plant\u00bfs processing system. The maximum stored quantity of chlorine is 720,000 pounds (4 full tank cars).\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis was conducted using EPA computer model \u00bf*RMP*Comp\u00bf.

Spare rupture discs are maintained on site.\nThe chlorine line/system is constructed of one (1) inch schedule 80 pipe. Three-hundred and fifty (350) pound fittings are used at all pipe junctures. The system operates at 110 to 120 pounds per square inch (psi). The piping is over the design specifications, to prevent any pipe or fitting failure. The entire system is inspected weekly and preventive maintenance is performed quarterly by qualified maintenance personnel.\nThe chlorine delivery tine is completely indoors, except for a short section between the building and the unloading connection. KIK also utilizes 2 heat exchangers to maintain over design specifications of the capacity on the system, exceeding Tier Two control requirements. Automatic high temperature shut are in place, in addition to redundant sensors and alarms. As an added safeguard, KIK employs local pressure indicators on the chlorine tank car and feed line. The Department of Transportation mandates in 49 CFR 179. 102 DOT specification 105A500w, that tank car is constructed of two steel shells. The internal shell is the pressure vessel holding the material and is to be constructed of a 1-11/16\u00bf with a minimum bursting pressure of l,250 pounds per square inch (49 CFR 179.l01-l).
