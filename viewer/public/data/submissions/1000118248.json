If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Lower Macungie Fire Department and the Lehigh County LEPC, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  The primary hospital response is provided through the Lehigh Valley Hospital (a Level 1 Trauma Center).  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line, L.P. - Macungie Station complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D - Program Level 3).  Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\nThe Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane process resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Macungie Station Butane Blending Process, it is the po"
