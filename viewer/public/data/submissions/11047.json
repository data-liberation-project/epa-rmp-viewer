      "SummaryText": "PHILTEX/RYTON PLANT\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training \nand consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our \nprocesses.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of \nregulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to \ncontrol and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant, located in Borger, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce \nspecialty chemicals and plastics.  The specialty chemicals units of the Philtex plant produce \norgano-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents and diversified chemicals. The \nplastics unit produces Ryton? plastic (the Ryton unit does not contain a regulated substance \ncovered by the Risk Management Program regulation).  The chemical plant has several regulated \nflammables (i.e., propane, butane, propylene) and toxics (i.e., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, \nmethyl mercaptan).    \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances is a catastrophic release of the \nentire contents (280,000 lbs.) of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the SO2 storage tank. Engineering and \nadministrative controls limit the amount in the storage tank to a maximum quantity of 282,000 \npounds. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their \nconsequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken \ninto account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3-ppm \n(0.0078 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 25 miles.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for SO2 is a blowout of a p"

The 5-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary for \nthe operator to detect the leak and to isolate this section of the transfer line.  Approximately 30 \npounds per minute SO2 would be released. No other mitigation measures were taken into account \nin evaluating this scenario. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0078 milligrams per \nliter) for this ARS is 0.43 miles.  (Note: the 5-year accident history indicates the largest release \nof SO2 was 3,690 pounds.  This was not a direct release of SO2.  The SO2 was a by-product of \ncombustion of the burning sulfolene.  Sulfolene (not a highly hazardous substance), was part of \nthe released chemicals which burned in the ensuing fire.  The SO2 released in this type of \nscenario is diluted with other combustion products and rapidly dispersed by the heat and \nturbulence of the flame.  The off-site impact is much lower than predicted by air dispersion \nmodeling of spilled pure SO2.). \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) \ninvolving the maximum intended inventory of the largest storage tank containing 1,3 butadiene.  \nAdministrative and engineering controls are in place to limit the inventory in the storage tank to \n94% of maximum, or 210,000 pounds.  This WCS assumes the entire inventory is released, \nvaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi \nendpoint for this WCS is 0.47 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such \nreleases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive or active mitigation measures \nwas taken in account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at Philtex is a VCE resulting from the release of butadiene \nfrom a transfer line (61,000 lb released over a 10-minute period).  The release is expected to be \nisolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation).  The d"

This ARS scenario was one of the scenarios evaluated \nduring the Building Siting study conducted at the plant in 1998.  As a result of the Building \nSiting study, hydrocarbon detectors, alarms and interlocks to automatically close isolation valves \nwere added to a number of hydrocarbon storage tanks, including the butadiene storage tank.  \nThis active mitigation measure was not taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  \n\nFigures 1 and 2 (following pages) graphically present the hazard assessment results for the toxic \nand flammable WCS and ARS events, respectively.  \n\nThe following table summarizes the results of the hazard assessments for the remaining toxic \nsubstances at the plant.\n\nChemical\nDistance to Endpoint (miles)\n\nWCS\nARS\nAllyl Alcohol\n0.6\n0.6\nHydrogen Sulfide\n13\n1.9\nMethyl Mercaptan\n12\n0.7\nPiperidine\n12\n2.8\n \nThe hazard assessments for the remaining flammables at the plant yielded a shorter distance to \nendpoint as compared to the flammable WCS described above.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the \nPhiltex/Ryton plant.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the \naccident prevention program are documented in the employee participation element of the \nPhiltex/Ryton Risk Management system and in the employee participation section of all other \nrisk management elements.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that \naddress process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to \npromote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from \nvarious areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant \nmanagement.  \n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the employee behavioral safety process and \nOSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  Philtex Plant received the National Association of \nManufacturers (NAM) Award for Workplace Excellence in the large manufacturing category in \n1997.  This award recognizes Philtex's use of a behavioral-based safety process (POWER, \nPeople Observing Work, Eliminating Risk).  This employee driven process has achieved a 65% \nreduction in recordable injuries since implementation.  An OSHA VPP site inspection team \nreviewed the Philtex/Ryton Plant in November 1998.  Induction of the plant into the VPP \nprogram is expected in the first half of 1999 as a result.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe \noperation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, \nlimits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design \nbasis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned \nresponsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.

This information includes materials of \nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This \ninformation, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for \nestablishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process \nand facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated \nwith the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is \nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to \nmanage these hazards.  \n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique \nto perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and \nthorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who \nhave operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

New employees receive \nbasic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully \ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and \ntasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to \nperform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all \noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and \nknowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. \nAll of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator \nunderstood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nPhiltex/Ryton uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased \nmaintenance or construction activities.
