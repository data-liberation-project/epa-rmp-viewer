      "SummaryText": "PHILTEX/RYTON PLANT\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training \nand consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our \nprocesses.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of \nregulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to \ncontrol and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant, located in Borger, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce \nspecialty chemicals and plastics.  The specialty chemicals units of the Philtex plant produce \norgano-sulfur compounds, high purity hydrocarbons, solvents and diversified chemicals. The \nplastics unit produces Ryton? plastic (the Ryton unit does not contain a regulated substance \ncovered by the Risk Management Program regulation).  The chemical plant has several regulated \nflammables (i.e., propane, butane, propylene) and toxics (i.e., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, \nmethyl mercaptan).    \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances is a catastrophic release of the \nentire contents (280,000 lbs.) of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the SO2 storage tank. Engineering and \nadministrative controls limit the amount in the storage tank to a maximum quantity of 282,000 \npounds. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their \nconsequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken \ninto account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3-ppm \n(0.0078 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 25 miles.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for SO2 is a blowout of a p"

The 5-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary for \nthe operator to detect the leak and to isolate this section of the transfer line.  Approximately 30 \npounds per minute SO2 would be released. No other mitigation measures were taken into account \nin evaluating this scenario. The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0078 milligrams per \nliter) for this ARS is 0.43 miles.  (Note: the 5-year accident history indicates the largest release \nof SO2 was 3,690 pounds.  This was not a direct release of SO2.  The SO2 was a by-product of \ncombustion of the burning sulfolene.  Sulfolene (not a highly hazardous substance), was part of \nthe released chemicals which burned in the ensuing fire.  The SO2 released in this type of \nscenario is diluted with other combustion products and rapidly dispersed by the heat and \nturbulence of the flame.  The off-site impact is much lower than predicted by air dispersion \nmodeling of spilled pure SO2.). \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) \ninvolving the maximum intended inventory of the largest storage tank containing 1,3 butadiene.  \nAdministrative and engineering controls are in place to limit the inventory in the storage tank to \n94% of maximum, or 210,000 pounds.  This WCS assumes the entire inventory is released, \nvaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi \nendpoint for this WCS is 0.47 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such \nreleases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive or active mitigation measures \nwas taken in account in evaluating this WCS.  \n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at Philtex is a VCE resulting from the release of butadiene \nfrom a transfer line (61,000 lb released over a 10-minute period).  The release is expected to be \nisolated by the operators within 10 minutes (active mitigation).  The d"

This ARS scenario was one of the scenarios evaluated \nduring the Building Siting study conducted at the plant in 1998.  As a result of the Building \nSiting study, hydrocarbon detectors, alarms and interlocks to automatically close isolation valves \nwere added to a number of hydrocarbon storage tanks, including the butadiene storage tank.  \nThis active mitigation measure was not taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  \n\nFigures 1 and 2 (following pages) graphically present the hazard assessment results for the toxic \nand flammable WCS and ARS events, respectively.  \n\nThe following table summarizes the results of the hazard assessments for the remaining toxic \nsubstances at the plant.\n\nChemical\nDistance to Endpoint (miles)\n\nWCS\nARS\nAllyl Alcohol\n0.6\n0.6\nHydrogen Sulfide\n13\n1.9\nMethyl Mercaptan\n12\n0.7\nPiperidine\n12\n2.8\n \nThe hazard assessments for the remaining flammables at the plant yielded a shorter distance to \nendpoint as compared to the flammable WCS described above.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the \nPhiltex/Ryton plant.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the \naccident prevention program are documented in the employee participation element of the \nPhiltex/Ryton Risk Management system and in the employee participation section of all other \nrisk management elements.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that \naddress process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to \npromote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from \nvarious areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant \nmanagement.  \n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the employee behavioral safety process and \nOSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  Philtex Plant received the National Association of \nManufacturers (NAM) Award for Workplace Excellence in the large manufacturing category in \n1997.  This award recognizes Philtex's use of a behavioral-based safety process (POWER, \nPeople Observing Work, Eliminating Risk).  This employee driven process has achieved a 65% \nreduction in recordable injuries since implementation.  An OSHA VPP site inspection team \nreviewed the Philtex/Ryton Plant in November 1998.  Induction of the plant into the VPP \nprogram is expected in the first half of 1999 as a result.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe \noperation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, \nlimits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design \nbasis/configuration information.

The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process \ncontrols and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems \n(e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the \ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of \nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This \ninformation, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for \nestablishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process \nand facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Philtex/Ryton Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated \nwith the various processes are identified and controlled.

All approved mitigation options being \nimplemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final \nresolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from \nthe original design safety features, Philtex/Ryton periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis \nresults. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency \nuntil the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and \nretained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final \nresolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPhiltex/Ryton maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) \nunit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal \nshutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

New employees receive \nbasic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully \ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and \ntasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to \nperform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all \noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and \nknowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. \nAll of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator \nunderstood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nPhiltex/Ryton uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased \nmaintenance or construction activities.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, \npersonnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into \nservice. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the \ndesign specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses \nchecklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and \nserves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements \nare properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPhiltex/Ryton has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, \nrelief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe \noperating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing \nwritten procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) \napplying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the \nmechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) \napplicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices \nto help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work"

Inspections and tests are performed to \nhelp ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits \n(e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the \ndeficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the \nuse of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the \nequipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Philtex/Ryton incorporates \nquality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is \nsuitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nPhiltex/Ryton has developed a team-based defect elimination process known as PRIDE \n(Philtex/Ryton Integrated Defect Elimination).  The objective of this employee driven process is \nto eliminate equipment failures through predictive and preventive maintenance.  As this process \ncontinues to take hold we expect continuous improvement in operating reliability and safety. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nPhiltex/Ryton has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. \nExamples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout \nprocedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for \nsafe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and \nprocedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure \nthat adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), \nalong with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance"

This system requires that \nchanges to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating \nconditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being \nimplemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new \nhazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical \nhazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are \nupdated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any \nnecessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPhiltex/Ryton promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a \nfire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal \nof each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the \nincident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to \nprevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.   Corrective actions \ntaken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are \ncomplete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation \nresults are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \nIncident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during \nfuture PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Philtex/Ryton periodically \nconducts an audit to determine whether the proce"

There has been 1 \nRMP event (1996) with onsite effects.  Every incident is carefully investigated to determine \nways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nPhiltex/Ryton maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and \npublic safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of \na regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is \naccidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid \nand medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, \nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident \ncleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Philtex/Ryton has procedures that address \nmaintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address \nthe use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to \nperform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when \nnecessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. The emergency response \nprogram changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training \naffected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Philtex/Ryton is coordinated with the Hutchinson County \nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Panhandle Emergency Response System (PERS). \nThis coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response \nofficials, local government officials, and industry repr"
