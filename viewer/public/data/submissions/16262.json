Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are received at this facility prepackaged in Department of Transportation approved cylinders. The common cylinder package is 150 pounds. Occasionally, Chlorine cylinders of less than 150 pounds are received. Facility activities involving the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide cylinders are; receipt of cylinders via truck, unloading from truck, onsite movement from truck to storage area via material handling equipment, onsite storage, onsite movement from storage area to delivery truck via material handling equipment upon customer order, and loading into truck for delivery to customer. Quantities of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide stored onsite are determined by the amount and frequency of customer orders. The typical average storage quantity of Chlorine onsite is 4,500 pounds. The typical average storage quantity of Sulfur Dioxide onsite is 3,000 pounds. Cyclohexylamine is received at this facility in tank truck quantity. The typical net product weight received is 45,000 pounds. Facility activities involving Cyclohexylamine include; receipt via tank truck, filling into tote bin and drum containers, onsite movement from filling area to storage area via material handling equipment, onsite storage, onsite movement from storage area to delivery truck via material handling equipment upon customer order, and loading into truck for delivery to customer. The typical average storage quantity of Cyclohexylamine onsite is 25,000 pounds.  \n\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nThe worst case and alternate release scenerios were modeled using EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.

The offsite impact for both Chlorine scenerios is on public receptors of residences. No other public receptors are impacted by either Chlorine scenerio. No environmental receptors are impacted by either Chlorine scenerio. The worst case scenerio for Sulfur Dioxide is a gas release.
