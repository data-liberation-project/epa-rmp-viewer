      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe at Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas LLC-Decatur are strongly committed to employees, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of corn syrup, dry dextrose, industrial starch, and baking starches. We have one regulated substance at our facility, ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is used in starch modification. \n\n\n\nThe storage system for EO is designed to prevent overheating and contamination of EO. Specific measures for EO storage passive mitigation include a break tank and a sump in the secondary containment area. Specific measures for EO storage active mitigation include a one-million gallon disposal tank, a packed-column vapor scrubber, cooling of ethylene oxide transfer, process control and detection systems. Nitrogen continues to be utilized for the bulk storage tank, break tank, and railcar blanketing. There is also the capability to use nitrogen for maintenance purging.\n\n\n\nPASSIVE MITIGATION\n\nThe BREAK TANK creates a \"BREAK\" between the process and the bulk storage tank. Isolating the process from bulk storage will reduce the risk of contaminants getting into bulk storage. Contaminents could lead to unwanted reactions causing temperature rise, pressure rise, or increase in level.\n\n\n\nThe storage area incorporates a sloped diked area around railcar unloading and bulk storage, draining to a sump. The sump allows reclamation of any spilled material or deluge water.\n\n\n\nACTIVE MITIGATION\n\nThe one-million gallon DISPOSAL TANK allows emptying and dilution "

      "SummaryText": "of the EO in the bulk storage tank and the break tank. The tank is maintained at sufficient levels of water to allow dilution of the EO. There are also provisions to mix caustic with the EO to speed the conversion to ethylene glycol.\n\n\n\nVapor can be generated from maintenance activities requiring tank and/or pipe purging. Vapor can also result from venting of the bulk storage tank in the unlikely event that high pressures and high temperatures occur from contamination of the EO. The PACKED COLUMN vapor scrubber converts EO vapor into glycol liquid which can be safely handled in the facility pre-treatment plant.\n\n\n\nThe COOLING SYSTEM in the storage compound maintains the temperature in the storage tank at 50-55 F. The cooling system includes a cooling jacket on the bulk storage tank and a heat exchanger on the transfer system.\n\n\n\nPROCESS CONTROLS have been utilized in the past to ensure the continuous monitoring of EO. \n\nThe Ethylene Oxide storage system has many layers of safety to prevent a release of ethylene oxide from the storage tank and associated system. All control interlocks are designed to shut down the system and bring it to a safe state for inspection and troubleshooting. There are EO ambient sensors placed around the EO storage compound that are continuously monitored by the Central Control Room personnel. The EO storage tank has a mechanical excess flow valve on its discharge. The system also has an emergency air supply enabling system operation even in the event of a power outage.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario and the alternate scenarios we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Off-Site Consequences analysis and EPA's RMPComp*. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention"

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-30 standard, NFPA-36 standard, applicable ANSI and ASME standards, and considering chemical supplier recommendations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary facility.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nTate & Lyle-Decatur maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The most recent methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Haz Op. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering maintenance, and process operations that are revalidated at regular intervals. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tate & Lyle-Decatur maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a maintenance shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\nTate & Lyle-Decatur has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nTate & Lyle-Decatur carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to insure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping"

Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance procedures. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Tate & Lyle-Decatur to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures were completed October 2012 for ethylene oxide.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPRE-START UP REVIEW\n\nPre-start up safety reviews relate to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at regular practice at Tate & Lyle-Decatur. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment in operation.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTate & Lyle-Decatur receives  audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and RMP rule are being implemented. Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audit are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nTate & Lyle-Decatur promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reocurring.
