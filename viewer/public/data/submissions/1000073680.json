In addition, some of the detail provided within this summary was excluded from the submitted RMP as current public access to this detail could expose the facility and personnel to terrorist or criminal activity.\n\n\n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. The process is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance. \n\n\n\nThis program was updated to satisfy the required 5 year update per section 2745.10(a) (1) and to make corrections as necessary. All elements have been reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\nThe following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\n\n\n1.

State regulations require reporting when there is a significant release or a threat of a significant release of ammonia or other hazardous material.  Mercer Foods interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.

The facility has retained the original manufacturer OEM manuals, equipment drawings, etc. for reference purposes and aid in maintenance activities. (Addressed under the Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the ammonia refrigeration system.
