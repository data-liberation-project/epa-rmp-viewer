This commitment is evidenced through support and direction given to both safety and environmental programs. This commitment is further exemplified through lack of incidents, injuries and lost time accidents. There has been only one lost time accident in the covered process area during the past five years.\n\nAt this facility, Saft America, Inc. manufactures specialty batteries for civilian and military use. Some of these specialty batteries use sulfur dioxide as a component of the electrolyte which is encapsulated into the battery. Larger battery systems are typically built by combining several battery cells which are connected through circuit boards. All of the components (cells, wiring and circuit board) are then further encapsulated in a tough plastic box for use in remote locations. \n\nSaft America, Inc., is located on about twelve acres of land located north of the Town of Valdese, North Carolina off Lovelady Road. A fence surrounds the entire facility. Guards are on duty twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. A Site Security Plan has been developed, approved and implemented during the past five years, and is incorporated by reference into this document. The facility is designed is designed primarily for mechanical manufacturing, with a small chemical mixing and storage area. The chemical area allows for (a) the receipt and storage of sulfur dioxide, (b) the receipt and storage of other electrolyte materials, (c) the mixing of the other electrolyte materials and the sulfur dioxide, (d) injection of the electrolyte into the cell, and (e) a wet scrubber and its supporting equipment for the pollution control of any fugitive emissions of sulfur dioxide. There are two liquid bulk storage tanks on site. One is for isopropyl alcohol which is used in another part of battery manufacturing "

The room has its own sprinkling system. The sulfur dioxide tank has several instruments attached which sense internal pressure, temperature and liquid level indication. The sulfur dioxide tank rests on load cells which monitor and measure the total weight of the tank and contents. Both of these systems help ensure against overfilling of the tank. The tank also has pressure relief valves which will vent the tank if excessive pressure develops. All of the vented gaseous sulfur dioxide, either from filling operations, electrolyte mixing, or from pressure relief valve venting, is collected and routed through a wet scrubber prior to discharge. Both the tank and appurtenant piping are routinely examined on a daily and weekly basis. \n\nSulfur dioxide is delivered to the facility in tanker trucks, and is unloaded directly into the sulfur dioxide storage tank. There is a specific unloading procedure posted at the facility. The unloading process involves connecting liquid transfer (loading) and vapor transfer (return) piping in the proper sequence. The reason for the return piping is to close the loop, impound all sulfur dioxide vapors and not allow escape of any material. It is also a requirement that all sulfur dioxide delivery truck drivers be trained in hazardous materials handling and specifically in sulfur dioxide handling. All deliveries are monitored by trained Saft America, Inc. personnel.\nSulfur dioxide is transferred from the bulk storage tank through a designed and engineered piping system. There are piping leak detection devices mounted at small intervals along the piping path. In addition, there are sulfur dioxide area monitors located in the electrolyte mix room and in the battery electrolyte fill room. Both of these systems are connected to an alarm system that will  warn emp"

The alarm point for the area detectors is 0.5 ppm, which is 25% of the mandated OSHA eight hour time period exposure level of 2 ppm (OSHA PEL of 2 ppm).\n\nBecause of the quantity of sulfur dioxide handled, Saft America, Inc. has prepared a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in response to regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as part of 29 CFR 1910.119. This regulation states that if there are certain chemicals present at a facility in amounts greater than specific limits; then, the facility must prepare a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan. Saft America, Inc. has one chemical, sulfur dioxide, present at the facility in greater than the trigger quantity. Consequently, a PSM plan has been prepared. The PSM is incorporated into this document by reference. The Process Safety Management plan was completely reviewed, revised and updated during the past two years. \n\nBecause of Saft America, Inc,'s committment to safety, rigorous safety planning and procedures for the safe handling of sulfur dioxide have been instituted. Process Safety Management (PSM) has already examined several of the safety practices and procedures in place for employees. In addition, Saft America, Inc. has established an emergency first response system which complements the response capability of the local fire department. Our emergency first response team is staffed with personnel that have completed mandatory OSHA training, and have had additional training in self contained breathing apparatus. In addition, all employees have been trained in hazard communication, hazardous materials handling training (where applicable), hazardous waste handling (where applicable), lock out/tag out, equipment emergency shutdown procedures, etc. Further, all employees have been instructed as to means of egress and congregation points. Evacuation routes are posted throughout the facility.\n\nThe worse case scenario for the release "

If this were to occur, the worse case scenario would be release of the entire tank contents. The release of this material would be within a diked area, and within a building. Therefore, the off site consequence analysis was performed by utilizing the US EPA published Off Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document and RMP*CompTM software. Under the worse case release scenario, the sulfur dioxide released would reach off site endpoints and nearby public receptors. In addition to the worse case scenario, we have analyzed two alternative scenarios which would not have as far a distant endpoint. \n\nBecause of the potential impact to off site and public receptors, we have developed and continue to develop safety programs and procedures for the safe handling of sulfur dioxide. The rules and regulations with which we comply include 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management; 29 CFR 1910.38, Emergency Response and Fire Prevention; 40 CFR 112, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures; 40 CFR 265, Hazardous Waste Management; 49 CFR 171, Hazardous Materials Handling; 29 CFR 1910.134, Personal Protective Equipment; and other rules pertaining to water and air emissions.\n\nWe have not had a reportable release of sulfur dioxide during the past five years. Additionally, we have not an accident or incident involving sulfur dioxide that has had as off-site impact. Our emergency response program has been developed in conjunction with the local fire department. We have developed as emergency first response capability in house, and have asked the local fire department to be on immediate standby in the event of an accident or incident. Specific, documented training has been conducted for our emergency responders.\n\nSafety planning continues as an ongoing process.
