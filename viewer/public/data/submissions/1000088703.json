All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\n\n\nThe Crosstown Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine to disinfect surface water from Lake Peachtree, Lake Horton, and Lake McIntosh. The plant can process up to 13,500,000 gallons per day and is at 3500 TDK Boulevard in Peachtree City, Georgia. The Water System provides drinking water to residents in Fayette County, Peachtree City, Tyrone, Woolsey, Fayetteville and Brooks. Industrial users are primarily concentrated in the Peachtree City industrial area.\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored at the Filtration Building and injected at two locations - just prior to the filters to control biological growth in the filters and again after the filters to provide a biologically safe product. The chlorination process includes chlorine gas stored as a liquid under pressure in chlorine containers, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment. The facility is manned twenty-four hours a day.\n\n\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas that is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.  To define the potential off-site impacts to the public and the environment from a chlorine release, Off-site Consequence Analysis was done to identify the impact circle, or area of concern, associated with two chlorine gas release scenarios.  The worst-case scenario, defined by the EPA, states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes.  Under Program 2 processes, the owner or operato"

      "SummaryText": "r is required to identify and analyze at least one alternative scenario that is \"more likely\" to occur than the worst-case scenario. An alternative scenario for the Crosstown WTP was chosen based on the most typical release situation.  The EPA recognizes that alternative scenarios are more useful for emergency response preparedness and planning than the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nFor each scenario, the EPA RMP*Comp dispersion modeling program was used to determine the impact radius, or the distance the chlorine gas travels from the point of release before the concentration in the air falls below a health-based value referred to as the toxic endpoint.  The theoretical toxic endpoint is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) concentrations developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  EPRG-2 is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine gas in air is 3 parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n\n\n\n \n\nAn accident history review found no incident that resulted in either on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years.  \n\n\n\nThe Fayette County Water System's Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Preventive maintenance program\n\n?    Process specific safety equipment\n\n?    Safe and effective standard operating procedures\n\n?    Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n?
