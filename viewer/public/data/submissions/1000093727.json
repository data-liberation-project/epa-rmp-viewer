Sherwin-Williams does not believe it was the intent of the Clean Air Act of 1990 to cover finished good aerosol storage at\n\nwarehouse locations. The regulations and written responses from USEPA are unclear as to whether finished good storage is a\n\nregulated process under 40 CFR 68. Sherwin-Williams is submitting this plan for compliance purposes only, and these fillings shall\n\nnot be construed as an agreement by Sherwin-Williams that these facilities are covered by the rule. Therefore, Sherwin-Williams\n\nreserves its right to withdraw, amend or alter its plan at any time and to refrain from any future filing under this rule.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of The Sherwin-Williams Company to conduct its business operation in such a manner as to protect the safety and\n\nhealth of our employees, our customers, the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe safety and health of employees, customers, the public and the environment is of the highest priority to The Sherwin-Williams\n\nCompany. We will implement programs which help to protect employees, customers, the public and the environment. We will\n\ncomply with all applicable laws and regulations and implement programs to help ensure compliance. We will review all present and planned facilities, processes and products to ensure conformance with the applicable laws and regulations. We will manufacture products that can be used, handled, stored, distributed and disposed safely with common safety practices and The Sherwin-Williams Company's safety and health information.\n\n\n\nThe facility is a distribution warehouse for liquid paint and aerosol products. The aerosol products may include paint, lubricants,\n\nadhesives, cleaners, disinfectants and air fresheners. Propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether (i.e., propellants) are the RMP\n\nflammable substances used in the packaging of aerosols. When the prop"

There are no listed toxic substances handled at this site in excess of\n\nthe threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is a hypothetical release of any of the hazardous materials listed under the RMP rule as determined by the\n\nUSEPA. The EPA mandates that companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance. Only passive safety\n\ncontrols, such as those controls in place that do not require action by an employee to initiate, can be considered. An example of a\n\npassive safety control is storage of a limited quantity. The worst case scenario presumes none of the site's mechanical controls or\n\nsafety systems requiring energy or human intervention are operational.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined by EPA to be a vapor cloud explosion. This scenario assumes that the total\n\nquantity of the flammable substance in the site's largest storage vessel (an aerosol container) is released into a vapor cloud, which\n\nthen explodes. The endpoint for the impact zone was determined by EPA to be an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch\n\n(psi) from the explosion of the vapor cloud. The results were modeled using an EPA model, RMP*Comp. The modeling for the warehouse assumed a release from the largest aerosol container having 300 grams of a flammable mixture (i.e., propellant). This resulted in an endpoint of 0.008 miles (37 feet). Please note that this distance is reported as \"0.01 miles\" in the submittal due to software limitations. This would not have an off-site impact. These results are very conservative. EPA's own guidance indicates that EPA considers not only the release of the total quantity of a flammable substance in a vessel into a vapor cloud to be highly unlikely, but also the explosion of a vapor cloud to be an unlikely event. Further, the guidance states that the endpoint of 1 pound per square inch is intended t"
