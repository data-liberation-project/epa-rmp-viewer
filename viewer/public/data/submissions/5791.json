      "SummaryText": "Lucky Stores, Inc. (\"Lucky\") is a diversified retailer of grocery products. Lucky is a wholly owned operating unit of American Stores Company (ASC, Salt Lake City, UT). Lucky operates many retail grocery stores throughout California and the Southwest that are supplied through a number of distribution and transportation complexes located in California, one of which is located in Buena Park, California.  The Buena Park distribution operation employs over 1150 people. The warehouses storing frozen foods, meat, and delicatessen products are cooled by two separate ammonia refrigeration systems, a 19,000-pound anhydrous ammonia system for refrigeration of frozen foods and a 15,000-pound anhydrous ammonia system for refrigeration of meat and deli products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Lucky has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to ammonia.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If? Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Lucky facility as well as experienced facilitators from Dames & Moore, an outside engineering firm.\n\nLucky is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Buena Park distribution center. Lucky's implementation of the revised PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia systems, and a program for both pre-sta"

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the systems.\n\nThe Lucky distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment. However, as part of the RMP requirements, Lucky undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in the systems.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 5,263-pound deli recirculator located outside the Meat/Deli Warehouse. The largest ammonia vessel onsite has a total capacity of 12,890 pounds; however, this vessel is indoors, and due to the mitigation provided by the building, had a smaller radius of affect than the release of the contents of the recirculator. Therefore, the analysis of the worst-case release of the Meat/Deli recirculator indicates that a potential exposure of an area approximately 1.78 miles in diameter (distance to endpoint of 0.89 miles) would result. The total population within the potential exposure area is 11,065.  Within this area there are schools, residences, and commercial/industrial areas.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for ammonia, Lucky analyzed incidents occurring at other refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA).  Owing to the fact that there are two refrigeration processes, one at the meat/deli warehouse and one at the frozen food warehouse, Lucky analyzed alternate cases for both and reports both results here.  The scenario chosen for both ammonia systems assumes a =\" hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers. Such a release would affect an area of 0.34 miles (0."
