PYA/Monarch is a food distribution company, distributing food products to various schools, hospitals, restaurants, military installations, etc.  PYA/Monarch has been in operation at this facility for over 10 years, operated within the Columbia community area for over 70 years providing food products and presently provides over 515 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nPYA/Monarch is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is PYA/Monarch's policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment and maintain compliance with safety, health and environmental regulations:  40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119). \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nPYA/Monarch uses anhydrous ammonia, (the 112(r) regulated substance), as a refrigerant to maintain the cooler and freezer sections within the required range of operating temperatures for the stored food products. This is a refrigerant that does not harm the earth's ozone layer.\n PYA/Monarch's refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping, contains a maximum amount of 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, PYA/Monarch has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA. PYA/Monarch's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of the largest sing"

Using the EPA's RMP*Comp program, the release scenario has off-site impacts.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  During normal operations, PYA/Monarch maintains the receivers at no more than 40% capacity.  Only during pump-down operations do the receivers have the potential to be filled to 80% of capacity.  The receivers are operated in pump-down mode  approximately less than 1% of the time during the year.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by PYA/Monarch taking into consideration the 10  year history of the operation's experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHA's) conducted to ensure that PYA/Monarch's hazards are identified and minimized. These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The most likely release scenario identified by PYA/Monarch would be a release caused by a forklift impacting one of the on-site evaporators located inside the plant.  In developing the release parameters of this alternative scenario, PYA/Monarch considered the area of highest lift truck traffic near an evaporator,  rupture of the largest pipe connected to the evaporator, the average response time of the facility's personnel to reach shutdown equipment, and the mitigation provided by the building structure.  Using EPA's RMP*Comp program, the release scenario has minimal off-site impacts.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with recognized codes for ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems. To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, PYA/Monarch has implemented several precautionary mea"

Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the facility are: \n\n1.Computer monitoring systems that monitor the operation of the entire refrigeration system, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This system will trigger alarm systems to indicate out of specification conditions.\n2. Compressor monitors which track pressures, temperatures, etc. that will initiate an alarm and shut the system down if limits are exceeded.\n3. Ammonia leak detectors which trigger alarms if a leak is detected\n4. High and low level alarms and automatic shutdown systems associated with the ammonia tanks.\n5. Relief valves to handle unexpected rises in temperature or pressure.\n6. Manual shutdown switches located in several areas of the facility\n7. Automatic fire alarms and fire sprinkler system in the ammonia room and the entire facility.\n8. The entire refrigeration system is inspected daily by facility personnel.\n9. Preventative maintenance is performed on the refrigeration equipment meeting or exceeding the equipment manufacturers required frequency.\n10. Qualified outside ammonia refrigeration contractors inspect the system and perform any non-routine repairs\n11. Any incidents are investigated and actions developed to prevent re-occurrences\n12. Operating employees and contractors are trained in safe ammonia system operation plus in their respective duties in case of a problem or emergency. Response drills are conducted.\n13.

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled to meet or exceed the equipment manufacturers required frequency. \n\nTo ensure that PYA/Monarch's control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, PYA/Monarch conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nIn addition, the facility is routinely inspected by the qualified ammonia contractors, the local fire department, the property insurance carrier, etc.\n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\nOver the last 5 years, PYA/Monarch has not experienced an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system causing any on-site death, injury or significant property damage, or known off-site death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPYA/Monarch has a general emergency re"
