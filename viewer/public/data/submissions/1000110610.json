Umatilla:\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nFlorida's Natural, Inc. has purchased the former Golden Gem facility in 2008 and the facility is now doing business as Florida's Natural Growers Inc., Umatilla.  We operate as a juice processing and packaging facility (NAICS Code 311411) using one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the facility's refrigeration process.  The refrigeration process is an integral part of processing, storing and preserving the facility's juice products. \n\nJuice arrives at the facility via trucks from various fruit processing facilities, including its Florida facilities.  The juice arrives chilled and is held in chilled storage to await packaging.  The juice is then processed and packaged into finished product and stored in chilled warehouses to await shipment to customers.\n\nThe facility's refrigeration process is divided into three separate processes.\n\nCompressor Room 1 (Main Facility)\nCompressor Room 2 (Freezers 5 and 6, Aseptic Tank Farm {ATF})\nCompressor Room 3 (Ready to Serve {RTS} Facility)\n\nAll three processes have a maximum intended inventory of the regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  Compressor room 1 process provides refrigeration for some of the facility's chilled warehouse space and juice concentrate tank farms.  Compressor room 2 process provides refrigeration for frozen warehouse space and the facility's bulk juice storage system. The RTS Facility (compressor room 3) process provides refrigeration for the facility's juice processing and packaging functions.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Procedures:\n\nThe facility has proactive safety programs, including an extensive Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.  The facility works diligently to provide a safe working environment for its employees and to prevent any accidental release of the regulated substance that may impact the facility or"

      "SummaryText": "its surrounding community.  The facility's ARP program combines and satisfies both the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management program.\n\nThe ARP program ensures that the processes are designed, installed, maintained, modified and operated in a safe manner.  Participation by the facility's employees is a key ingredient in the development, implementation and maintenance of each of the ARP program's elements.  The program elements include policies and procedures regarding employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training employees on procedures, contractors' safety, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, permitting for hot work, management of process changes, emergency planning and response, compliance audits and offsite consequence analysis.\n\nTrained employees perform routine monitoring of the systems to assure system deviations are quickly addressed.  All employees and contractors that work on or around the covered process are trained in the hazards of the processes.  Contractors are pre-approved by the Safety department to ensure safe work standards are followed at any work site within the facility.\n\nThe facility has installed safety devices to reduce the risk of an accidental release of the regulated substance and to minimize the impact should one occur.  One of the safety devices is an automated control system that can automatically shutdown the system in the event of a system deviation that may result in a release.  Another safety device is ammonia leak detection systems installed in each of the compressor rooms that serve the RTS and Freezer 5 and 6 facilities.  The detection systems are connected to the machine rooms' control systems, which sound local alarms to notify employees of a release of the regulated substance in the area being monitored.\n\n\nEmergency Response Policies and Pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocedures:\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Response Plan in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and disseminated to facility personnel.  The facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  The facility's emergency response plan consists of employee notification (alarm) and evacuation, followed by notification of the appropriate local and national emergency agencies.  The facility's employees do respond to accidental releases and the facility's employees fully cooperate with emergency agencies.  Designated maintenance personnel have received hazardous material training to the technician level in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(iii).  A facility evacuation plan has been developed, disseminated to facility employees and included in the Emergency Response Plan documentation.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility is proud of its past record of having no accidental releases that resulted in on-site injuries, deaths, significant property damage or any off-site injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nPlanned Process Safety Improvements:\n\nThe facility is continuously refining its safety and ARP programs.  The facility routinely holds process safety management meetings to discuss results of mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations and management of changes.  The facility has installed ammonia detection systems in the machine rooms, with an emergency ventilation system.  The facility has recently replaced an older condenser model with a much newer efficiency model and the facility's newest implementation is a predictive maintenance program plan that includes vibration testing and thermography of the Refrigeration equipment and electrical components."
