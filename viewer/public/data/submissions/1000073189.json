This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities. Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nCrestwood has a land and track lease agreement with Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company for the short-term storage of 40 railroad tank cars containing isobutane (IC4) near Canton, OH. These railroad tank cars are expected to be on site between 30 to 60 days. The rail tank cars will be delivered and transported to their final destination by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. \n\n\n\nBased on the anticipated duration of rail tank car storage onsite while disconnected from a locomotive fits the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The railroad tank cars contain one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Isobutane.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\n\n\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe storage of the regulated substance. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for safe storage of the isobutane and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained by operations. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment cons"

Crestwood safety information includes, written procedures and trained personnel, which provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities while the railroad tank cars are stored onsite. \n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\n\n\nCrestwood has conducted an onsite assessment of the temporary rail spur siting referenced above to ensure it is adequate and free from hazards associated with the storage of isobutene containing railroad tank cars; for the intended duration.  Should potential hazards be identified Crestwood will systematically examine it and ensure that adequate controls are in place to mitigate the potential risk appropriately.\n\n\n\nFindings are prioritized on a relative risk ranking based on Crestwood's Corporate Risk Matrix. This ranking helps ensure that potential hazards assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to hazard review are prioritized and tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nCrestwood maintains written procedures that address deliveries and shipments for railroad tank cars. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for deliveries and shipments for railroad tank cars, Crestwood has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and t"

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nCrestwood has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
