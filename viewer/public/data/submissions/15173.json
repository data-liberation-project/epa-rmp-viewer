      "SummaryText": "o proceed.\n7 We pursue an open dialogue with all relevant opinion leaders in society.  Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Greenville, Ohio site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe BASF Corporation Greenville, Ohio site uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  This chemical is used to manufacture resins for use in automotive coatings. \n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst Case:\nLiquid spill and vaporization of Toluene Diisocyanate from storage tank with off-site impact to bordering industrial facility.  This storage tank includes a concrete containment dike.\n\nAlternative:\nTransfer hose failure releasing Toluene Diisocyanate without off-site impacts. The unloading area has passive mitigation controls (e.g. concrete containment dike), active mitigation controls (e.g. pump shutoff interlocks), and administrative controls (e.g. dedicated pumps and hoses).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard,  and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases over the past five years which meets the reporting criteria.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Darke County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).  The site has active participation on county EMA.  Site Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc."
