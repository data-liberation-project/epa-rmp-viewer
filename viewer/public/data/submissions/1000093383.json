The Houston Terminal is a liquid storage terminal located at 2345 Tidal Road, Deer Park, Texas 77536.  This executive summary is provided to meet the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") regulatory requirements in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\") Part 68, specifically 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPOPNSE POLICIES\n\nThe VMH Houston Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  The facility uses a combination of emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our workers and the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and our uses of substances that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n?    A five-year history of accidental releases for chemicals that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n?    An overview of our emergency response program.\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe VMH Houston Terminal is a liquid storage terminal that will receive anhydrous ammonia from refrigerated ocean vessels, temporarily store the ammonia in two (2) 15,000-ton refrigerated, double-walled storage tanks, then send the ammonia offsite via underground pipeline to customers.  Anhydrous ammonia receipt and storage is the only covered process at the site regulated under the RMP rule.  Anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of 10,000 pounds has been identified as having the potential to c"

Anhydrous ammonia storage is also regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") rules as a highly hazardous chemical.  Because the covered process at the site has the potential for a worst-case release to affect a public receptor and anhydrous ammonia is considered a highly hazardous chemical under the OSHA PSM rule, the covered process is regulated under Program Level 3 of the RMP rule.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each key feature of a successful prevention program, including:\n\n?    Process safety information\n\n?    Process hazard analysis\n\n?    Operating procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical integrity\n\n?    Management of change\n\n?    Pre-startup review\n\n?    Compliance audits\n\n?    Incident investigation\n\n?    Contractors\n\n?    Employee participation\n\n?    Hot work permits\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program are utilized to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business.  We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nProcess safety information is maintained according to the regulated substances using Safety Data Sheets (\"SDS\") and other applicable information.  Data on the technology of the process is maintained, such as flow diagrams, maximum inventory, safe upper and lower limits of temperature, pressure, flow, and composition, including the consequences of deviations.  Design information on the equipment in the process is maintained as required, including, but not limited to construction materials, relief systems, design standar"

The process hazard analysis is revalidated when any changes in the process warrant and at intervals of no more than five (5) years even when no process changes have occurred.\n\nWritten operating procedures are provided to ensure that the covered processes are operated in a safe and efficient manner.  These procedures also identify any different operating scenarios, operating limits, unique hazards, safety systems, and safe work practices.  Each employee and contractor involved in operating the process is trained in the operating procedures prior to operating the process and provided refresher training at least every three (3) years.\n\nProcess equipment is maintained and inspected according to written procedures developed according to manufacturer recommendations and good engineering practices.  Equipment deficiencies identified during inspection are corrected in a timely manner to ensure safe operation.  Employees and contractors are trained in the process and associated hazards to ensure that their job tasks may be performed in a safe manner.\n\nWritten management of change procedures are maintained and utilized to address impacts on safety and health, operating procedures, timing of changes, authorization requirements, employee and contractor information and training, and process safety information.\n\nPre-startup safety review procedures are addressed for all new or revised processes that involve a change in process safety information.  The pre-startup safety review addresses design specification compliance, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures, resolution of any process hazard analysis recommendations, and employee training.\n\nCompliance audits to evaluate compliance with the RMP rule requirements are conducted every three (3) years.

Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are presented to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis is a new facility that is designed to operate in a safe manner and employees and contractors are trained to operate the facility safely and use safe work practices.  Potential changes to improve safety may be identified during periodic reviews of operations, safety procedures, and training.  The potential changes identified to improve safety will be evaluated to determine if these changes would reduce hazards and increase safety at the facility.  If it is determined that any of these changes will contribute to improved safety, they may be incorporated into the prevention program for the facility.\n\n"
