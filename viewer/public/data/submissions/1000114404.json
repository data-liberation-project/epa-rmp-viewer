The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post- incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, quarterly emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release. Critiques are held on drills and actual events. Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.\n\nKPEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which Institute's emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWe continue to implement projects to improve process safety as opportunities are identified via external regulatory changes and/or internal process safety program changes or evaluations.  Planned changes include the installation additional cameras with enhanced monitoring capabilities."

Audits are conducted using established schedules and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWVO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nUCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. UCC employees working in Institute plants are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nWVO hires contractors to perform some specialized maintenance, distribution, and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed. WVO has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes he/she may encounter while on site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.

Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWVO carries out a documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training prior to the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at WVO.

This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPs), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Institute Site is a manufacturing facility that manufactures catalysts for use in the production of ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. Raw materials are delivered to the plant in containers and tank trucks; and then stored in tanks. These process materials are combined and then sent to a reactor. The processing materials are recovered, and the product is sent to storage. The product is shipped in containers. The site has an ethylene oxide distribution system which includes unloading of railcars containing ethylene oxide into storage tanks, railcar storage, and distribution of ethylene oxide via pipeline to customers at the Institute facility and South Charleston facility.\n\nThere are currently three RMP regulated substances present in three covered processes at the site.
