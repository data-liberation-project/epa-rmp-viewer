This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  It is the policy of Calpine and LCRA to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Lost Pines 1 Power Plant, located in Bastrop County, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  Lost Pines 1 is a joint venture of Calpine Corporation and the Lower Colorado River Authority.\nAs a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the two gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in two storage tanks, located on opposite sides of the plant.  The storage capacity of each tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\nAs required by the RMP rule, the worst case scenario is the catastrophic rupture of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The release duration is ten minutes.  The 14,200 gallon tank is limited to 80% of the storage capacity by administrative controls, including operating procedures and high level alarms.  The EPA's RMP*Comp, version 1.06, was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\nThe alternative release scenario analyzed was the complete release of the tank inventory over a ten minute period (worst case scenario with alternative release scenario metereological conditions).  The release rate to the atmosphere is actively mitigated via a water curtain.  The EPA's RMP*Comp, version 1.06, was used in the analysis.  Based on"

The accidental release prevention program at Lost Pines 1 includes:\n\nEmployee Participation\nAll Lost Pines 1 employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLost Pines 1 maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is updated when changes in the process occur.\nInformation concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and stability data, and the effects of inadvertent mixing.\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, process chemistry, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\nInformation concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrument diagrams, electrical area classification, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, material and energy balances, and safety systems.\n\n Process Hazard Analysis\nLost Pines 1 has a comprehensive program to ensure that th"

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nLost Pines 1 maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually.\n\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of Lost Pines 1 are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process.  Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.\n\nContractors\nLost Pines 1 uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work.  The plant also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nLost Pines 1 conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup p"

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLost Pines 1 has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.  \n\nHot Work Permits\nLost Pines 1 has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety.  The hot work permit program is designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nLost Pines 1 has a system in place to ensure safety concerns associated with changes to the ammonia process are reviewed and addressed prior to the change.  The changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards as well as to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.
