These chemicals are used to manufacture surfactants.  The end products of the Gurnee site using the RMP chemicals as raw materials are used for personal care, food additives and automotive coatings.  \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility complies with EPA's Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard . The facility's PSM program serves as the RMP Prevention Program.  The Prevention Program describes the policies and procedures in place to prevent and address accidental releases; these include Employee Participation, Process Hazard Analyses, Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices, including Hot Work; Training, Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Contractors, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nThe site uses a mix of control equipment, procedures and processes, and work practice controls to reduce the risk of releases of the subject chemicals.  These include:\n\n\n\na. A distributed control system (DCS) for process control which reduces the risk of an accidental release and responds automatically to prevent and/or mitigate the impact of a release in the event of a malfunction or unexpected event such as a power failure. A separate program logic controller (PLC) continuously monitors process safety parameters on equipment and activates controls to bring operations into a safe mode if parameters are exceeded; and,\n\n\n\nb.  Emissions control devices, including wet and dry scrubbers which capture emissions of ethyl"

All incidents involving our RMP & PSM substances are investigated and appropriate corrective actions implemented to ensure we minimize the risk of similar/repeat incidents occurring.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Vantage has a signed agreement with SET Environmental to respond in the event of an hazardous materials emergency. SET can be mobilized and onsite in less than 1 hour. The site is also equipped with water deluge systems the EO/PO Storage areas and process areas to suppress vapors, keep equipment cool and put out any fires. Air monitoring equipment is strategically staged to monitor for air borne flammable hazards and EO/PO specifically in the production room.  Local Police, Fire and EMS visit the site each year for a tour and training on the hazards of EO. Employees are trained how to identify an emergency and how to appropriately respond. There is an alert system at the site that is used to notify all employees of an emergency and the need to take action as well as two-way radio communications. There are layers of protection and redundant process control systems that will prevent or reduce the severity of a release.\n\n\n\nThe LEPC Coordinator for the county has been advised that the site is covered by the RMP regulations, has taken a tour of the facility, and maintains regular communication with the site.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nProcesses are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee safety programs that include monthly safety meetings, daily pre-shift safety talks, employee process and safety training program, incident investigation and corrective a"
