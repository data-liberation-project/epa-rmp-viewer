The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility\n\n\n\nWe have never had an accidental release here, but we have trained for it, the likelihood of this happening seems remote at best. The improvements, where the cylinders are to be stored in a sealed room and the addition of scrubber should improve our record.  \n\nWhat seems to restrict us in attempting to \"have a plan\" is that we have plans in place under the Annex R (chemical release) and Annex T (Terrorism) that fall under our Homeland Security Department and the 911 system that completely removes us from the Command and Control Structure? These plans are part of the RMP binder. IF any type of incident happens, in its most basic form we call 911 and situate in place.\n\n\n\n2.    Your facility and the regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nWe are the drinking water supply for St. Bernard Parish and we use chlorine for disinfection.  Our state requires and approves this type of disinfection in preparing portable drinking water from the Mississippi River. \n\n\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nMaximum intended inventory was included in the hazard review, Safe limits, equipment specifications and codes were located in the safety information section of the RMP manual.  Signs warning that a toxic hazardous chemical, chlorine, was in the area are now properly posted.  We are improving training and with the chlorine cylinders being stored in the sealed room many changes will be made\n\n\n\n4.    The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.  The US Census data for Chalmette indicates that in the 2000 Census, we had 32,069 people.  This has gone to, in our 2010 Census to 16,751 people, a minus 47.8% increase in population.\n\n\n\n5.    The emergency response program\n\n\n\nOur facility has an emergency response plan in Section IX and Appendix E (Annex R and Annex T) of the Risk Management Plan. These se"

The St. Bernard Fire Department, St. Bernard Office of Emergency Preparedness, and State Police are included in the notification process. The fire department is designated as the On-Scene Coordinator designee in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\n\n\n6.    Changes made to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe new water plant was placed on-line in October 2014, the new safety process(s) include Tank Mounted auto shut off valves and a 1 ton capacity Scrubber System.\n\n"
