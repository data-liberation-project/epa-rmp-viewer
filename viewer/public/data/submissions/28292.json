Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen in the amount handled by this facility, is considered hazardous by EPA.  Liquid Chlorine is used for cooling water treatment, specifically as a biocide.  Chlorine in the amount handled by this facility, is considered hazardous by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices, (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the request of local fire support through Channel Industries Mutual Aid so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\n\nOne of the principal purposes of this facility is to manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Gaseous hydrogen is used by our customers in their manufacturing processes.  Gaseous Hydrogen is produced in the partial oxidation process unit and transmitted to the customers via pipelines.  In addition, hydrogen is filled into DOT regulated tube trailers for the over road deliveries to customers. "

The chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers, two of which are located on site.\n\nProcess Description: Natural gas and oxygen are received in our plant via pipeline and used as a feedstock.  The oxygen and natural gas are combined in gasifier in a process called partial oxidation (POX) reaction.  The partial oxidation process is a process where oxygen and natural gas are injected through a burner into a hot refractory lined gasifier.  The oxygen and natural gas are converted in the gasifier at 2500 F to syngas.  Syngas consists mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  Carbon dioxide and steam are also produced in the partial oxidation process.  Carbon dioxide is removed from the syngas by flowing through a scrubber.  The syngas is dried to remove moisture, and then separated into hydrogen and carbon monoxide through a cryogenic distillation process.  The carbon monoxide from the distillation process is compressed and delivered to customers via pipeline.  The hydrogen is sent through a pressure swing adsorber to remove residual carbon monoxide.  The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to our customers via pipelines or filled into tube trailers and cylinders.  Back up hydrogen is provided by a 20,000-gallon liquid hydrogen storage tank and gaseous hydrogen storage tube banks.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable mixture.  The maximum amount of this substance is: \n\n?    81,000 pounds of flammable gas containing approximately 31% hydrogen and 10% methane\n?    4000 pounds of chlorine stored in 2000 pound containers\n\n3.

The total quantity of hydrogen is assumed to form a vapor cloud and ignite resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. (VCE).  Ten percent of the released quantity of hydrogen is assumed to participate in the explosion.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint (1 psi over pressure) for this WCS is 0.25 miles (1,337 feet).

(ACS) scenario for flammable substance at this facility is (1 psi) overpressure from a breakage in the E-102 heat exchanger inside the fired heater due to piping failure.  The entire inventory of the pipe and connections vessels of 7,100 pounds of a flammable substance is assumed to be released.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined overpressure end point is 0.13 miles.\n\nThe ?worst-case scenario?

Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas\nor toxic gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA?s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid for emergencies related to the Hydrogen process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
