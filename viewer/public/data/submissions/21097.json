Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHi-Temp, Inc. is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place.  This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that a release should occur, our emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of such a release.\n\n\n2. Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nHi-Temp, Inc. is a commercial heat treating service utilizing continuous electric and gas heated furnaces to perform multiple manufacturing processes on customers parts. Manufacturing processes include hardening of 410 stainless steel; annealing of all types of steel and cast iron; tempering & stress relieving; copper, silver & nickel brazing; passivating of stainless steel; copper stripping and aqueous washing. In addition zinc electroplating and zinc phosphating processes are also performed. \n\nHi-Temp, Inc. consists of three plants located on one contiguous piece of property. The plants house offices, manufacturing operations and storage. Plant #1 is located at 310 S. Wolf Road, Northlake, IL. Plant #2 is located at 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake. Plant #3 is located at 5400 W. Lake Street, Melrose Park, IL. The mailing address of the facility is 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake, IL 60164.  \n\nProcess 1 - Plant #1: Air Permit Operating 73070248\nThe property of Plant #1 is bounded by Bristol Hose & Fittings, located at 311 W. Lake Street Lake Street to the North, the Union Pacific Railroad to the South, M. Holland Company, 21 W. Lake Street to the West, and a vacant building to the East.  \n\nThere is an office building and gas station across the bou"

The freight lines run on the northern tracks and the passenger trains use the southernmost tracks. The properties that border to the east and west are industrial facilities and offices.

It is a gas that is liquefied under pressure. It is delivered, installed by transfer hose, and stored on site in steel tanks in this liquid form. There are two (2) tanks. One 13,000 gallon tank, and one 1,000 gallon tank. The tanks are constructed of steel and are approximately 1.5\" thick. These tanks are stored outside of Plant #1 on the south side of the building approximately 100 feet north of the Union Pacific Railroad Line (the south property boundary). The tanks are stored on the ground and are enclosed in a locked chain link cage.
