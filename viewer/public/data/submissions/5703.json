The Olin Charleston facility uses mercury cell technology to produce chlorine and sodium hydroxide. We also  produce sulfur dioxide through the oxidation of sulfur.   We also produce hydrochloric acid by burning hydrogen and chlorine.  In our processes, we use and manufacture the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nChlorine, 26,000,000 pounds are potentially stored on-site.   Normal expected on-site storage of Chlorine is 6,500,000. Olin produces chlorine for sale to other business, as well as on-site manufacturing of hydrochloric acid.\n\nSulfur Dioxide, 3,300,000 pounds are potentially stored on-site.  Normal expected on-site storage is 1,200,000.  Olin produces SO2 for sale to other business as well as on site manufacturing of sodium hydrosulfite.\n\nHydrochloric acid > 37%, 1,200,000 pounds are potentially stored  on-site.

The 371 employees at the Charleston facility live in Bradley, Meigs, McMinn, and Polk counties. Olin employees are involved in the communities and care about the environment which all of us in southeastern Tennesssee share and enjoy.\n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the surrounding communities is a priority at our plant. We understand that we are an intergal part of the community. We support the Olin Community Adivisory Panel which was formed in the early 1990's and is comprised of community members who represent business, education, religion, and youth interests. Bi-monthly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests. Annually, represenatives of the Charleston panel join members from other Olin panels across the country for an Olin Community Advisory Panel Conference. At this conference, community members work with Olin to enhance the panel's effectiveness by sharing success stories.\n\nIn addition to community out reach, Olin's safety and environmental program is rooted in the fundemental belief that all incidents are preventable. Our Goal is Zero incidents. This commentment helps to insure that an emergency situation with off-site implications will never occur.  Olin has put six layers of safety and environmetal protection in place: employees; mechanical intergrity; process hazard reviews; process controls; monitoring systems; and emergency response.\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nAt the Olin Charleston plant, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.

Olin produces HCl for sale to other business and on site useage.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our manufacturing and use of these chemicals.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWe have chosen 1  toxic worst case scenario and 3 toxic alternative release scenarios for RMP submission.  We modeled a total of 12 toxic release scenarios for consideration.  Incident probability, chemical toxicity,  quantity stored/inventory,  historical data,  toxic endpoint,  and  mapping results were just  some of the factors considered in selecting  the scenarios for submission. \n    \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\u0015 Process safety information\n\u0015 Process hazard analysis\n\u0015 Operating procedures\n\u0015 Training\n\u0015 Mechanical integrity\n\u0015 Management of change\n\u0015 Pre-startup review\n\u0015 Compliance audits\n\u0015 Incident investigation\n\u0015 Employee participation\n\u0015 Hot work permit\n\u0015 Contractors\n\nThe individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has experienced 2 incidents associated with a RMP covered process,  a nonloss workday"

Neither of these incidents resulted in any off site impacts.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan, and involve local community represenatives and fellow plant employees in the plan development and undates. We practice this plan on a regular scheduled basis, from a basic fire drill to a full scale multiple county CAER drill.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nThe following is a list of recent improvements that we have implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases. In addition, the Olin Charleston facility commitment to continous improvement and internal review process assures the on going generation of improvements such as these.\n\n1. Goal is zero initiative \nThe Charleston facility began work in the third quarter of 1998 on a far reaching initiative to achieve zero safety, environmental, distribution, and process incidents. We have involved all levels of employees in developing the vision in each strategic area and work on action plans to make this vision a reality.\n\n2. BAPP process for continuous improvement.\nOur behavioral accident prevention process BAPP at Charleston is call PRIDE (people reducing injury developing excellence) and has just celebrated it's third anniversary. In the coming year we will expand the program to observe environmental issues. This process will then develop action plans for continuous Olin Responsible Care improvements.\n\n3. ORC Improvement plans and audits\nThe leadership team of Charleston regularly evaluates the process that  will improve our safety and environmental performance and an updated strategic plan is utilized to capture action plans. Periodic internal audi"

ORC Point Person Network\nIn 1997 each of the  teams established at Charleston plant, assigned  a member to assist the team in ORC related activities. Each of these point persons has received training on how to effectively integrate ORC activities within their team. We will continue to develop this role. As the role is rotated to others over the coming years, it will serve to improve the safety, health, and environmental culture at Charleston.\n\n5. Sulfur dioxide plant oxygen feed system upgrades\nThe oxygen feed system to the SO2 reactor had major instrumentation upgrades and an emergency failsafe shutoff valve installed to reduce the negative impact of an oxygen line rupture. The new instrumentation allows monitoring of the system to help prevent a feed line rupture. As an additional backup, a failsafe valve will shutoff preventing sulfur from being pressured out. Also added was a block wall around the reactor and feed piping which will act as a personnel  barrier.\n\n6. Termal Recovery Unit installation of new filter and pumps\nWe have installed a new(Laufer) filter and associated pumps and other equipment in the TRU facility to process mercury bearing material as a means to reduce mercury levels in this material. Previously this material was manually collected and handled by the TRU operator for processing. This will result in a significant reduction in mercury exposure to these workers. \n\n7. Chlorine railcar automatic shutoff system\nOlin recently installed an emergency shutdown system for chlorine railcar loading. This system will automatically shut off the chlorine supply to the railcar angle valves. The shutoffs are activated on car movement as determined by electric eye. This system is recommended by and complies with Chlorine Institue Pamphlet #57. \n\n8. Chlorine remote surveillance system\nOlin recently"
