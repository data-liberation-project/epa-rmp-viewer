Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implements, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manger, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule. \n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Woodbridge \u00bf Brodhead facility is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for"

The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals immediately prior to pouring the mixture into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously moving line. The mold moves through a curing oven. Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, crushed, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers. Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA\u00bfs risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck. It is stored in four tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room. The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system. \nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 576,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tOff-site consequence analysis scenarios \n\nEPA\u00bfs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenario\u00bfs for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.  \n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint was Aloha version 5.3 software for plume modeling.  Atmospheric conditions were obtained from the NCDC for the Monroe Municipal Airport located approximately 15 miles west of our facility.  Parameters used for the model were 102 degrees Fahrenheit air temperature, 60% relative humidity, 1.5 m/s winds from the west, and class F atmospheric stability.  A rural / open environment was assumed due to the characteristics of the local terrain.\n\nWorst?Case Release Scenario \nCatastrophic failure of a railcar full of TDI at the railsiding, discharging its entire contents of 200,000 pounds in 10 minutes, as is stipulated in the RMP rule.

As there is no containment at the railsiding, it is assumed that a pool with a depth of 1 cm is formed and evaporates to form a cloud that disperses downwind.

A residential population of 10 and industrial population of 250 at Knight Manufacturing .17 miles to our east could possibly be affected by this worst-case scenario event.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nCatastrophic failure of a rail car full of TDI at the truck unloading site, discharging its entire contents in 10 minutes.  The resulting liquid forms a pool with an area of 18,500 square feet and a depth of 1 cm that evaporates to form a toxic cloud, which disperses downwind. The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L is 151yards, and would not affect any residential areas. \n\n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.

Monitors are used in the process and storage areas to constantly check for any leaks, and a visual system is in place that allows remote inspection of tanks.

We have had six small releases of TDI in the past five years. Each release occurred inside the facility buildings with two resulting in minor injuries, two resulting in property damage and zero having an environmental impact.  A thorough and complete investigation of each of these releases was conducted in accordance with our accident/incident investigation program, root cause was determined, and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n6.\tThe emergency response program.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provided essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. We have coordinated our program with the local emergency planning committee and the fire department. A representative of the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.  In addition we have conducted two drills in conjunction with the LEPC, fire departments, Red Cross and local hospitals.\n\n\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nAt this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety management systems.
