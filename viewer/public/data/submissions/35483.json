      "SummaryText": "Helena Chemical Company (Helena) operates an agricultural chemical dealership near Butte City in Glenn County, California (Facility).  Helena has implemented an EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address regulatory requirements from Section 112r of the Clean Air Act.  Based on Facility operations and the regulatory requirements, a Program Level 2 Prevention Program has been prepared for the Facility.\n\nThe Facility stores and distributes agricultural chemicals to the local agricultural community.  The chemical stored at the facility that is regulated under the RMP program in a quantity larger than the RMP threshold is aqueous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia in the last five years.  The consequences of potential worst case and alternate case releases of the regulated chemical have been evaluated using EPA's RMP Comp software.  Based on these analyses, toxic endpoint concentrations for the regulated could be exceeded offsite.  Evaluations of the consequences of potential releases are included in the California Accidental Release Prevention Program document."
