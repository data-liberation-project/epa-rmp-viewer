The [dry] feedstock is stored, milled and conveyed from the Grains Building to the Process Building, where it is mixed to form a mash and fermented.  The resulting liquor is distilled and processed to produce denatured ethanol, that is shipped via truck and/or rail.\n\nPublic access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate.

There is a general alarm system at the property and the plant is fully lighted.  \n\nPoet Biorefining is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  In the event of an emergency, Poet Biorefining\u00bfs Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety, but there is no facility emergency response team.  Poet Biorefining\u00bfs Emergency Coordinator will determine if outside assistance is needed, and he or she will provide site logistics information to emergency responders; provide technical information to responders as to materials spilled (reactivity, control systems, etc.) and stored; and generally serve as technical information advisor to the Fire Department Incident Commander and/or contract hazardous material response team.  \n\nImmediately after an emergency, P"
