This accumulator receives suction from refrigerated tanks, glycol chillers, and cooler units.  Liquid which is trapped in the accumulator is returned to the system.\r\n\r\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas), at 150 to 175 psig, is vented to roof-mounted condensing towers.   The condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration equipment and accumulators.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, condensers, suction accumulators, receiver, and chillers from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the accumulators and intercooler.  The high pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from leaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent releases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact employees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or represent an off-site impact.  Moreover, a release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these line"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n \r\n1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Roberts Dairy in Omaha, Nebraska is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store fluid milk and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 15,600  pounds (i.e., 3,100 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 3,800   pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 3,200 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system, consisting of a high pressure and low pressure side.  A freezer operates on the low side to store ice cream product.  Ammonia suction from the low side at about 0 psig passes through the low accumulator before entering the booster compressors.  Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low accumulator and pumped out to the low sid"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\r\n\r\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the What-if/checklist technique.

The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\r\n\r\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\r\n\r\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \r\n\r\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.
