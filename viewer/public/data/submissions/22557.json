As part of this commitment, G-P/Crossett has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at G-P/Crossett. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n\u00b7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine).\n \n\u00b7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes).\n\n \u00b7 an emergency response program to respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes. \n\n\u00b7 a management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner,"

      "SummaryText": "it is only one component of the safety program at G-P/Crossett. In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\nG-P/Crossett minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n \nG-P/Crossett limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety programs at G-P/Crossett consist of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nG-P/Crossett is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the r"

G-P/Crossett provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Crossett Paper Operations.\n\n1.2\tGeorgia-Pacific Crossett Operations and Our Regulated Substances\n\nG-P/Crossett is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (Cl02) for the use of bleaching pulp. The facility also stores and uses chlorine in one-ton cylinders for water treament. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3. \n\nThe current plan reflects a revision to the orginial RMP Plan submitted June 1999 for elimination of chlorine, which includes all railcars, in the bleach plant and an increased storage capacity for chlorine dioxide.  The data associated with chlorine use in Prevention Program ID 4, remains in the plan for historical reference only.\n\n 1.3\tOff - Site Consequence Analysis\n\nG-P/Crossett performed an off- site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment. The off site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release  scenarios. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like G-P/Crossett and, (2) would result in an off- site consequence if the re"

The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off- site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the end- point distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations. These requirements include:\n\n\u00b7 one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\u00b7 one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n \n The following information summarizes the off- site consequence analysis performed by G-P/Crossett.\n  \n 1.3.1 \tProgram Level 3 Processes - Chlorine Dioxide (Cl02) Solution System and chlorine water treament.\n \n a.

There are also several environmental receptors.\n \n b.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine is the failure of a one inch diamter transfer line, allowing chlorine to be released from a pressurized 1 ton cylinder (100 psig) at the rate of 150 lb/min for 13.0 minutes. The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration, based on the EPA Lookup Table approach, is approximately 1.7 miles. The United States Census indicates that approximately 4,000 people live within this distance. Several public receptors are also located within this distance (public elementary school, several industrial facilities, several recreation parks, and several subdivisions).

The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide solution line located at the discharge side of the ClO2 transfer pumps' header.  The pump could pump approximately 10,008 lb/min for 5 minutes before the release would be stopped by the automated shut-off valves. The released chlorine dioxide solution will form a pool of minimum depth (1 cm) and evaporate to form a vapor cloud.
