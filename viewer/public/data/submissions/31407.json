A facility emergency evacuation plan has been prepared and disseminated to facility personnel.  Unannounced ammonia release evacuation drills are performed every 12 to 18 months with all employees, including on-site HAZMAT team, and the Cedartown Fire Department.\n\n7.2  Red Cross shelter resources in the Cedartown area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with local schools and some local churches.  Schools and churches that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would have food, cots, and first aid supplies on site and reserve supplies could be shipped in.  An emergency management official (HAZMAT Team, Fire Department, Police Department, etc.) would decide if sheltering in place or evacuation and sheltering is required in a given emergency and would then direct the Red Cross to activate the shelter(s) determined to be located at a safe distance from the hot area, if needed.  those in need of medical attention would be taken to a nearby hospital.  Reference:  American Red Cross Office of Floyd County, Brenda Jenkiins, (706)291-6649.\n\n8.0  Planned changes to improve safety ('68.155(g)).\n\n8.1  Future plans to inprove anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at Zartic Foods, Inc. consist of continuing annual operator and HAZMAT training and improved housekeeping, and addressing items brought forward in the upcomming PSM audit and emergency response action items."
