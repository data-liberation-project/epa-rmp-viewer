This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\r\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\r\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\r\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \r\nWe coordinate our response efforts with the Clark Fire Department, which provides additional\r\nemergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank and eleven 1,000 gal. nurse tanks at the maximum fill\r\ncapacity of 85%  at our facility in Clark, South Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is\r\n77,000 gallons ( 336,805.7 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest\r\nsingle storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios \r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nClark County Farmers Elevator maintains a detailed record of safety"
