Chlorine is an effective destroyer of pathogens in water.  Our employees and their families live here and we are all dedicated to the safe operation of our facility.\n\nPolicy:  Safety of employees and the public are of primary concern.  As a part of the public service sector, we are committed to protecting the public and the environment.  Our programs include an aggressive preventative maintenance program, extensive training and coordination with local emergency response personnel to efficiently react to an emergency.\n\nDescription of the Facility:  We treat the wastewater for our area.  Part of the process requires insuring that disease-causing pathogens do not cause outbreaks of illnesses in the public.  Chlorine is used to kill bacteria and other pathogens in our process.\n\nOur system includes automatic alarms and we have procedures in place to respond to emergency situations.\n\nWe have a very special automatic system called a scrubber with a backup generator.  In the event of a chlorine leak, this system is designed to collect all of the chlorine from a full cylinder and neutralize it so that our employees and the public are protected.\n\nThere are strict licensing requirements to be a plant operator.  In addition to our on-site training and safety procedures, the EPA and OSHA rules regulate our activities.\n\nAs part of the requirements of this EPA program, we carefully reviewed our accident history for the last 5 years and we found that we have operated without a reportable chlorine related incident.  We are dedicated to safety and our record proves it.\n\nIn case of an emergency, our personnel will work with local fire department responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  We have training every year for our people and we coordinate with the fire department on a regular basis.  Although we take extensive precautions to prevent a chlor"

This is the same philosophy, which leads to fire drills and first aid training.\n\nThe City of Tiffin's PSM/RMP was developed by NCEC a professional consulting firm. As part of this PSM/RMP program we performed an extensive self-evaluation with the assistance of a professional consultant. We are constantly looking for methods to improve. To insure safety, we have instituted a  procedure to perform a safety review of all mechanical or procedural changes."
