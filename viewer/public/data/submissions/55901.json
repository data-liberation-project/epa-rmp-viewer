The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP Submittal.\n \n1.4 \tRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia have inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nThe history of the Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. (i.e., no RMP applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. Systems.\n\n1.5 \tPrevention Program \nAs part of the implementation of this Prevention Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Colusa County Farm Supply, Inc. to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nThe maximum intended inventories of aqueous and anhydrous ammonia are 3,000,000 (30% by concentration) and 237,000 pounds respectively.  Therefore, the anhydrous ammonia is over the 10,000 lbs threshold for EPA RMP and the OSHA PSM threshold quantities.  As a result, the anhydro"
