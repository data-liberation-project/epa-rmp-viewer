(Matheson) facility transfills, purifies, and/or stores compressed specialty industrial gases in cylinders in both large and small quantities.  The source material gas, which is transfilled and sometimes purified, may be packaged in tube trailers, ton cylinder units or cylinders, depending on the gas.  The finished product varies from a single pure chemical gas to gas mixtures, and the capacity of product cylinders varies from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas depending on the size of the cylinder and the type of material involved.  \n\nMatheson has identified four processes at this site containing greater-than-threshold amounts of RMP chemicals: hydrogen chloride, phosgene, hydrogen sulfide storage, and chlorine storage.  As indicated, storage only chemicals maintained at levels exceeding RMP reporting thresholds have been identified as RMP \"processes\".  Because of the quantities involved, all processes were assigned to Program 3.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the USEPA definition of a worst-case scenario, the loss of the entire contents of the largest container over a period of ten minutes was modeled using RMPComp.  Such a release is extremely unlikely since 1) it assumes catastrophic failure of a cylinder that is built to withstand pressure and temperature well above normal operating conditions; 2) it assumes the simultaneous failure of all safeguards; and 3) no allowance is made for the presence and use of active mitigation systems and procedures.  Consequently this should not be considered a credible release situation. \n\nThe regulations also stipulate that smaller containers be modeled using the worse case parameters.  Should a smaller container impact an area larger than the largest container, that data must be reported as the worst-case scenario.  Although the largest container on-site contains 2,700 pound"

Consequently, the release from the smaller container is the worse case scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at this location is for phosgene and assumes the loss of 2,000 lbs. of gas in ten minutes, resulting in a theoretical off-site impact of 18 miles.\n\nAlternative case scenarios\n\nIn compliance with the Federal definition of the alternative case scenario for toxic substances, a more realistic, yet unlikely, release scenario, having offsite impact, has been identified for hydrogen chloride, phosgene, hydrogen sulfide, and chlorine.\n\nFor phosgene and hydrogen chloride, the alternative release scenario involves a break or rupture in the filling line.  Releases are more likely to occur during the filling process, and the most likely point of release in the filling process is the line or pipe used to convey the gas from the source cylinder or tube to the product cylinder.  Although identified as a more credible release scenario, the likelihood of this incident occurring is decreased by operator training and system checks performed prior to filling activities. \n\nFor hydrogen sulfide storage the alternative release scenario is a valve leak.  No actual chemical processing occurs during storage.   Based on the stringent DOT standards imposed on compressed gas cylinders, the valve represents the only credible release point for a cylinder in storage.   \n\nFor chlorine storage the alternative release scenario is a leak from the relief device located on the end of the ton unit.  No actual chemical processing occurs in storage.   Based on the stringent DOT standards imposed on compressed gas cylinders, the relief device represents the only credible release point for a cylinder in storage.   \n\nTo provide the most conservative data, the toxic endpoint was modeled using a release rate calculated with the most conservative data a"

In 1997 the hydrogen chloride fill line ruptured, releasing less than one pound of liquid hydrogen chloride instantaneously.  There were no off-site impacts. \n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM and EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nCompressed gas cylinders are manufactured, used, and maintained to the exacting codes and standards of the Department of Transportation (DOT), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA).  These standards were developed to safeguard against cylinder failure, even under extreme conditions during shipping and use.  Cylinder construction is mandated in all aspects including metallurgy, wall thickness, and design pressure.  In short every cylinder is designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions that make either catastrophic or routine failure extremely unlikely.  In fact, each cylinder must be re-qualified to this standard every five years.  As with the cylinders themselves, any appurtenance such as pressure relief devices and valves must also meet similarly strict manufacturing, use, and maint"

      "SummaryText": "enance standards.  In addition to these codes and standards, Matheson has an established policy of filling cylinders below the DOT approved fill pressure.  Compliance with these internal and external codes, standards, and policies significantly reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic failure of a compressed gas cylinder.\n\nThe facility is equipped with mitigation equipment to contain and/or control potential releases.  There are appropriate scrubbers to neutralize any fugitive emissions, and special emergency containment vessels and devices to completely contain a leak.  Monitors and emergency shutoffs are also present. \n\nIn addition to the integrity of the cylinder and its components and the mitigation technology available to contain and/or control a release, this facility has established operating procedures and experienced operators.  Cylinders are leak checked when they are first received and leak checked prior to being shipped out.  Cylinder areas are routinely inspected.  Trained, experienced operators have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their responsibilities and are able to assess and resolve possible problems before they result in a release.
