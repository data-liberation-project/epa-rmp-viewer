(Jayhawk operates a batch specialty chemical manufacturing facility near Galena, Kansas.  The industrial area within which Jayhawk property and manufacturing operations are located is known locally as the Jayhawk Plant, dating back to its creation in the 1940s. That portion of the Jayhawk Plant Site containing Jayhawk property, buildings and equipment will be referred to hereinafter as the \"Facility\". \n\n\n\n    The Facility is located on approximately 850 acres of a 2,200-acre industrial complex. Jayhawk's Unit 1 encompasses approximately 29 acres and Unit 2 encompasses approximately 25 acres. The Facility is located approximately 3.5 miles north of the junction of Kansas Route 66 and U.S. Highway 400 at Riverton, Kansas. \n\n\n\n    The regulated substances handled at Jayhawk include:\n\n1.    Acetaldehyde CAS # 75-07-0\n\n2.    Ammonia (water solution) 24% CAS # 7664-41-7\n\n3.    Anhydrous Ammonia CAS # 7664-41-7\n\n4.    Chlorine CAS # 7782-50-5\n\n5.

While the RMP rule originally required that the Executive Summary briefly describe the OCA for worst-case and alternative release scenario(s), EPA amended the RMP rule in 2004 to remove this requirement because of security concerns. Your Executive Summary should not describe nor include information concerning your worst case or alternative release scenarios.\n\nWorst case scenarios were developed for each regulated chemical. The assumptions made included that the chemical was instantaneously released through catastrophic failure of the container, and if there were multiple containers of a single chemical within the same proximity, the release included the entire contents of all of the containers.\n\n\n\nAcetaldehyde\n\nJayhawk's facility includes a two tank that contains acetaldehyde.

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 1479 persons located within the radius of the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case\n\nThe catastrophic failure of the containers, or simultaneous failure of all containers for a chemical, is highly unlikely. The tanks and cylinders have safety devices and systems to prevent or minimize the effect of any accidental release. An alternative scenario has been selected for each chemical that, although still very unlikely to occur, has a higher probability of occurrence than the worst-case scenario, in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance.\n\nResidential population, public receptors and environmental receptors were assessed for each chemical within the radius of its associated endpoint. In most there was residential population, no environmental receptors, and the only public receptor that appears in the available data is the Boston Mills School located one-half mile east. This school was investigated and no longer exists. Therefore, there are no public receptors within the maximum endpoint radius of the alternative case scenarios.\n\n\n\nAcetaldehyde\n\nA more likely scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of the railcar unloading system. The chemical is transferred to the tank using nitrogen pressure and a closed loop system, and should a hose fail, the entire contents of the tank might escape. The alternative scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of a 2-inch unloading line releasing all of the contents of a tank. \n\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the acetaldehyde tank (alternative case).

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 14 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\n\n\n\nMethyl Chloride\n\nA more likely scenario for methyl chloride is the leak from cylinder or ISO during process operations.  \n\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the Methyl Chloride leak (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 1 person located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\n\n\n\nPropylene\n\nA more likely scenario for Propylene is the failures of a transfer line or hose. Therefore, the alternative scenario involves the release of Propylene through a 3-inch rupture in a container. \n\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the Propylene alternative case scenario. The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 0 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\n\n\n\nPhosphorous Trichloride (PCl3)\n\nA more likely scenario for PCl3 is the failure of a charge pipe during process operations.  \n\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors within for the PCl3 drum (alternative case). The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 14 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\n\n\n\nTetramethylsilane\n\nA more likely scenario for Tetramethylsilane is a process line leak during process operations.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates that there are no environmental receptors for the Tetramethylsilane leak ("

There have been no off-site consequences involving regulated processes, or regulated chemicals, at the facility. There is no five-year accident history involving either regulated processes or chemicals that involve personnel injury, death, or significant property damage.  \n\n\n\n(e)    The facility has an Emergency Response Plan intended to protect human health and the environment. There is a procedure for the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Training is provided to all employees on the Emergency Response Plan and the emergency equipment available at the facility. This Emergency Response Plan is updated as often as necessary, but not less than once every three years.  Emergency response is provided by the Galena, KS Fire Department with mutual aid assistance agreements with Columbus, and Baxter Springs, KS Fire Departments. Columbus is located approximately 10 miles northwest of the facility, and Baxter Springs is located a"

      "SummaryText": "pproximately 10 miles southwest of the facility. There is a Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for Cherokee County, KS. Mutual aid response times are approximately 30 minutes from the initiation of the notice. There is a Jayhawk staffed Emergency Response Team which has training in incipient stage fire response. Additional support is provided through coordination of the emergency with outside agencies through use of the plant telephone and emergency notification system.\n\n\n\n(f)    Apart from compliance with specific guidelines, the policy of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals is also aligned to continuous development, especially in terms of plant and occupational safety, environmental protection, protecting the health of its employees, product safety, transportation safety and site security.  Specifically, JFC operates with a policy of investigating near misses and incidents and includes findings into updates of our safety management policies and procedures.  Communication to plant personnel is routinely held to inform and train employees on improvements learned from the incident reporting management system.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nJayhawk utilizes the LOPA (layer of protection analysis) for process hazard analysis of each covered process.  This detailed analysis guides the site in determining specific prevention measures to preclude accidents. Jayhawk Fine Chemicals capital plan includes projects to improve occupational safety and environmental protection. One aspect of Jayhawk Fine Chemicals capital project planning process is driven by the review of hazards during the LOPA PHA process. This process often identifies best available technologies which are routinely employed to reduce risk. A distributed control system (DCS) is utilized to improve control of operating processes. This system is updated routinely to maintain the safety of our processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
