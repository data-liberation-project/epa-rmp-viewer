The plant uses isopentane \n(2-methyl butane) as a foam blowing agent. The foam is utilized for various packaging applications. Since \nthe plant stores more than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs of isopentane onsite, the isopentane process is the only process which is subject to USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations which are codified in 40CFR Part 68. Isopentane is an colorless volatile liquid with a pleasant mild odor that is listed by the USEPA as a regulated flammable substance for accidental release prevention.  Isopentane can be safely utilized under regular plant conditions if handled appropriately with care.\n\nIsopentane Process\nIsopentane is brought into the plant by tanker trailers from an outside vendor.  The plant stores the \nisopentane in a single pressure vessel which is maintained at ambient conditions at a maximum operational \npressure of approximately 20 psig.  In the foam manufacturing process, the pressurized gas-phase blowing agent is injected into melted plastic pellets in an extruder at temperatures of 375-440 degF along with some color additives and aging agents. The mixture exits through a specially designed die head with a resultant loss of pressure, allowing the blowing agent to expand to ambient pressure which in turn, transforms the plastic into a foamed material.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nThe Nielsen & Bainbridge plant is committed to manage and operate the plant in accordance with relevant \nUSEPA regulations and general good operating practices to ensure minimization of the risk of an accidental \nrelease of isopentane from the foam manufacturing process.  The state of Illinois has adopted the OSHA \n(Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Process Safety Manage"

In order to ensure periodic monitoring and continual evaluation of the RMP/PSM program elements being implemented at the plant, the Nielsen & Bainbridge plant has instituted a command-and-control emergency response (ER) organizational structure within the plant.  In addition to their regular duties, members of this structure have additional RMP/PSM-related responsibilities to consolidate the long-term management of the RMP/PSM program.\n\nHowever, at this time the PSM exercise is still in progress and certain PSM-related elements have not been \nfully addressed in this RMP submittal. But Nielsen & Bainbridge is confident that the PSM exercise will be \ncomplete within the next thirty to sixty days. Then the plant will be submitting a revised RMP (incorporating the PSM elements) for the isopentane process within forty-five to sixty days from the date of submittal of this RMP. \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario was assumed to be the complete loss of contents of the 32,500 lbs \nisopentane storage tank which is located outdoors. In this analysis, no applicable passive mitigation \nmeasures were accounted for. Typically, the USEPA guidance for defining a worst-case release scenario \nfor all regulated flammable substances is to assume that the worst-case release results in a vapor cloud \ncontaining the total quantity of the substance that could be released due to a pipe or vessel failure.  Then for the worst-case consequence analysis, it must be assumed that the vapor cloud detonates. Thus, the quantity of isopentane available for the vapor cloud explosion (VCE) was given as 32,500 lbs.  The worst-case accidental release was modeled using USEPA's public-domain RMP*Comp model to determine the \ndistance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. The endpoint distance does go offsite, but only nomin"

In addition, the process is equipped with explosion-\nproof pumps and reinforced piping. This effort minimizes the chance that the isopentane storage tank would fully discharge its contents in an accidental release that would result in an offsite impact.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nBased on discussions with Nielsen & Bainbridge plant personnel, the following alternative release scenario \nwas modeled - a complete rupture of the 2.0-inch diameter line from the isopentane storage tank to the \nprocess. The line rupture was assumed for a duration of 15 minutes till appropriate mitigation could be \napplied. This active mitigation would be manifest as an emergency shutoff valve which would be activated \nby trained plant personnel wearing PPE with the onset of a preset line pressure departure.\n\nThe above alternative release was modeled using USEPA's public-domain RMP*Comp model to determine \nthe maximum distance to the endpoint of the lower flammability limit of 1.4% due to a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint distance does go offsite, but only nominally. In reiteration, it should also be noted that Nielsen & Bainbridge plant employees regularly inspect the isopentane storage tank for potential leaks and overall structural integrity. In addition, the process is equipped with explosion-proof pumps and reinforced piping. This effort minimizes the chance that piping from the isopentane storage tank would rupture and discharge significant quantities of isopentane in an accidental release that would result in an offsite impact.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAt this time, the Nielsen & Bainbridge plant is proactively implementing an OSHA Process Safety \nManagement (PSM) program (codified in 29CFR Part 1910.119) for the isopentane process.

In June 1999, the plant will perform a PSM audit and a HAZOP process hazards analysis (PHA) on the isopentane system with the help of an outside consultant in order to review existing operating procedures, equipment maintenance schedules, operational safeguards and identify action items to render the process safer. Following the PHA, the plant is investing in developing a written PSM program with the help of an outside consultant.  The written PSM program will provide the procedural backbone for various safe operability functions (i.e., continual review of safe operating procedures, review of mechanical integrity of equipment, improved maintenance schedules, increased training, better access to process safety information and hazard awareness for both employees and onsite contractors, and effective emergency response planning) and thereby, allow the plant to maintain, review and evaluate the program on a periodic basis.\n\nIn addition, the plant will soon invest in completing an upgrade of the isopentane safety system. Additional \ncheck valves and emergency shutoffs will be installed to mitigate accidental releases of isopentane.  These system upgrades should complement the organizational and procedural aspects of the prevention program which will hopefully minimize the risk of an accidental release of isopentane from the Nielsen & \nBainbridge plant process.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nIsopentane has replaced freon as a foam blowing agent at the Nielsen & Bainbridge plant over the last two \nyears.

ER team members are drawn from the existing employee pool and the organizational concept fosters pride and emphasizes concerns for safe operation of the plant. Ultimately, any safe operation is a grassroots movement that must be nurtured within the plant perimeter with the employees themselves.  The addition of a well defined ER organization at the Bridgeview plant operating in conjunction with local emergency responders such as the Bridgeview Fire Department should greatly alleviate any safety concerns about handling isopentane at the plant.\n\nIn addition, the Nielsen & Bainbridge plant will soon be completing an upgrade of the isopentane safety \nsystem. Additional check valves and emergency shutoffs will be installed to mitigate accidental releases of \nisopentane.
