The Hazard analysis was also revised and updated at this time. Hazard Analysis revisions included mitigation measures of \u00bfrelease in direct contact with the outside air\u00bf and updated population using 2000 census data. The rural area around the facility has transformed into an urban area since the original RMP submission. Population estimates in the Worst case release have increased significantly. Population estimates in the Alternate case remained the same.\r\n\r\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at P-R Farms, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Such releases are not predictable but our plans are fully coordinated with the trained emergency response personnel at Mid Valley Fire Department to control and mitigate the effects of any releases.\r\n\r\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities revolve around large-scale storage, processing and manufacture of nuts and tree fruit products.  Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant in a re-circulated system for Controlled Atmosphere, Cold Storage and Freezer. The maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is over the threshold of 10,000 lbs..\r\n\r\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), includ"

      "SummaryText": "ing administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  Distances were developed using RMP Comp Software. The following paragraphs provide a summary of the chosen scenarios. Sensitive details have been omitted as required for National Security.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  The scenario involves releasing the entire Ammonia inventory with complete vaporization into a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. This is an almost impossible scenario based on the amount of heat required to vaporize this amount of liquid ammonia. Sixteen million Btu\u00bfs would be required during the 10 minutes. In addition, all of the ammonia would need to be in a single vessel. In operation the ammonia is distributed throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a compressor shaft seal failure resulting in a 1/4\u00bf diameter hole.  The estimated release rate based on typical pressures is 10 lb/min. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 30 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include manual equipment isolation.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is less than .1 miles. Under normal conditions compressor shaft seals are replaced when oil seal lubrication drip rates exceed manufacturer tolerances and before a release occurs.\r\n\r\n4.Th"

Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nP-R Farms, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     What-if-checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and scheduled for revalidation at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis should be addressed in a timely manner. The initial PHA resulted in a number of recommendations that were not implemented or rejected in writing, and the revalidation was late.  These matters have been noted and are being addressed by the new management. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, P-R Farms, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.
