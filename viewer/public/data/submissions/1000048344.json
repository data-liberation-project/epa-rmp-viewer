Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\r\nThe primary function of Seymour Terminal is to act as a propane distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with propane and other LPGs, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Safety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle propane as well as on the various safety devices incorporated into the design of our equipment.  Furthermore, comprehensive training received by our employees adds to the inherent safety of our distribution facility.  The facility is an RMP Program Level 3 facility, and as such, has developed and implemented a comprehensive, integrated safety program, that takes into account all facets of operation and is committed to continually reviewing and improving the effectiveness of the safety program.  All levels of employees, from ground level operations to the executive suite, are committed to the safe operation of this and all company facilities.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the NPGA\u00bfs LP-Gas Safety Handbook, Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures, How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires, State and Local Regulations, and Company Policy.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible release of propane, if a release does occur, our highly trained local emergency response personnel are at hand to control and contain the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Jackson County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2. The"

Propane arrives at our facility via pipeline and transport and is stored in a 21,000,000 gallon underground cavern and (40) - 34,500 gallon storage tanks.  Additionally, mixed LPGs, such as TransMix, are received via transport and stored in up to (20) - 34,500 gallon storage tanks.  This facility has equipment for unloading transports and receiving propane from pipeline facilities and equipment to load transports and containers.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n \r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is Flammable Mixture.  At any time, the tanks on the property may hold Propane, Butane, TransMix, Propylene, or other mixed or pure flammable materials.  The maximum amount of Flammable Liquid that can be stored at this plant is 83,504,256 lb., comprised of 78,355,200 lb. in underground storage and 5,149,056 in aboveground storage.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario.\r\nCalculations for DTE for all release scenarios were made using EPA's RMP Comp software, and following EPAs published guidance on selecting worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for propane involves a catastrophic release of butane from the largest tank.  The scenario involves the release of 123,930 lbs. of propane.  The release quantity has been limited by 88 percent resulting from written procedural mechanisms. According to RMP Comp, the DTE for this release"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on- the- job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  \r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\nSeymour Terminal carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in these practices.  Furthermore, personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nSeymour Terminal promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of propane or other LPG.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year Accident History\r\nSeymour Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\r\nSeymour Terminal carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of flammable liquids.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nOur facility's emergency response plan is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas handbook, Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Response Procedures, How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires, S"

      "SummaryText": "scenario is 0.4 miles. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane loading operations, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  In this scenario 633lb. Of propane is released in a quarter of a minutes.  The most likely source of this release is a hose rupture during loading. There is no passive mitigation, but the release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valve(s).\r\n\r\n4.   The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.   Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40CFR part 68 of the EPA.
