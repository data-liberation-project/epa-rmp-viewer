      "SummaryText": "Chugach Electric Association, Inc. (Chugach) owns and operates the Southcentral Power Project (SPP).  Chugach has recently permitted four gas fired turbines of 59,900 hp each and four gas-fired duct burners of 140 MMBtu/hr each at their International Station Power Plant in Anchorage, Alaska.  Although four turbines and four duct burners were permitted, Chugach has chosen to only install three gas fired turbines and three gas-fired duct burners at this time.  The new units will be operating with selective catalytic reduction for NOX emission controls.  The facility will use aqueous ammonia solution (29.4 percent by weight) in the selective catalytic reduction process for NOX control.\n\nChugach has prepared this risk management plan (RMP) based on 40 CFR Part 68 and other published guidelines from EPA because SPP will have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process.  The aqueous ammonia storage and handling system is the only process at SPP that triggers the RMP requirement.  This process was determined to be covered by federal RMP Program Level 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nTo prevent potential ammonia accidents with offsite impacts, Chugach has established the following practices:\n\n?    The facility utilizes an extensive, interconnected alarm system to monitor the tanks;\n\n?    Access to the site is restricted via guard gates to authorized personnel;\n\n?    All facility personnel are trained on safe work practices and the proper procedures to be followed should a leak or spill occur;\n\n?    Spills are contained in the dike, minimizing the impact distance;\n\n?    The tanks and unloading areas are situated away from the main process area, such that if an accident were to occur, the area of highest impact would generally be away from employees; and\n\n?    Tanks are inspected to ensure their integrity.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at the facility in the past five years.  \n\nChugach has developed their accidental rele"

These are described in the operating, maintenance and safety procedures for working with the aqueous ammonia solution and tanks.  The documents provided from the equipment vendors contain many of these procedures in Johnson March Systems, Inc.'s Operations and Maintenance Manual ,  Peerless' Control Narrative and TriTech Energy Services' SCR System Operation documents.\n\nAs part of the emergency response program, Chugach has contracted NRC Alaska Inc. to respond to aqueous ammonia spills.  Chugach personnel will respond to smaller spills.  Chugach has also developed written emergency response plans as outlined in this document to ensure the protection of public health and the environment.  The emergency response plan details procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidents.  Those responding to spills are required to have proper training and knowledge of how to use emergency response equipment.\n\nChugach will retain records supporting this RMP for a minimum of five years.\n\n"
