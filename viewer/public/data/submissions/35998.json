      "SummaryText": "JohnsonDiversey, Inc. (JDI) is a leading global provider of cleaning and hygiene solutions to the institutional and industrial marketplace.   JDI?s Ashley Warehouse, located at 14611 58th Road in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, is used to store packaged finished goods prior to their distribution.  Because JDI stores aerosol products at the Ashley Warehouse, the site has the potential to exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for flammable substances that are used as propellants in aerosol cans.  Therefore, JDI is submitting a predictive filing for flammable substances.\n\nThe worst-case scenario performed, based on the TNT-Equivalency Method presented in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure will not extend beyond the Ashley Warehouse?s property line.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nAn emergency response plan is maintained at the Ashley Warehouse and reviewed annually to identify potential plan updates recommended to improve site safety.  No accidental releases of regulated flammable substances have occurred at the Ashley Warehouse in the last 5 years.  Coordination of emergency response activities is facilitated by the site?s inclusion in the Racine County?s Office of Emergency Management offsite response plan and by compliance with the annual chemical inventory filing requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act program."
