              "Description": "A. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n[40 CFR 68.65]\n\n1. Regulated Substance Hazards\n\nA Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia is provided in Appendix A.4 along with Response Information Data Sheet (RIDS) from the Computer-Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO) software provided by the National Safety Council in cooperation with the EPA.\n\nThe Safety Data Sheet provides information on; toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects of mixing with other materials. SDS will be distributed to all personnel operating the refrigeration system.\n\n2. Process Technology\n\n2.1. Block Flow Diagram\n\nA simplified block flow diagram for the covered process can be found in Appendix A.5. \n\n2.2. General Process Chemistry\n\nAt this facility, ammonia is the refrigerant used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling, water chilling and vacuum cooling. The refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry is as follows:\n\n1.    Low-pressure vapor is compressed to high-pressure gas by refrigeration compressors.\n\n2.    High-pressure vapor is condensed to high-pressure liquid by the evaporative condensers. Condensation occurs because of heat rejection to ambient resulting from the evaporation of water sprayed on the condenser coils.\n\n3.    High-pressure liquid gravity feeds from the condensers to the high pressure receivers. Then the high pressure liquid is transferred to Controlled High Pressure Receiver due to the pressure differential maintained between two vessels. High pressure liquid is stored in CHPR until needed.\n\n4.    High-pressure ammonia is fed from the controlled high pressure receiver to the low-pressure receiver and surge drums. This is made possible by the pressure differential between the two vessels. Pressure is dropped when the liquid passes though an expansion device located between the high- and low-pressure receivers.\n\n5.    Low-pressure liquid is pumped to the cold room evaporators using mechanical pumps.\n\n6.    In the case of falling film water chillers, vacuum tube coils and plate frame heat exchangers (make up water chillers), low-pressure liquid is gravity fed to the coils and plates from surge drums.\n\n7.    Evaporation of the low-pressure liquid occurs due to warmer air or water coming in contact with the evaporator coils. The evaporation produces the cooling effect of refrigeration.\n\n8.    A mixture of vapor and liquid is returned to the low-pressure receivers and surge drums. Low-pressure vapor is drawn off by the compressors to begin the cycle again while the liquid is circulated back through the evaporators by low-pressure receivers and surge drums.\n\n2.3. Maximum Intended Inventory\n\nThe refrigeration system is a closed system. Ammonia is not stored on-site outside of the refrigeration system. The approximate facility charge is 16,900 lb. A detailed overview of the ammonia charge can be found in Appendix A.6.&#8195;\n\nTable V.1. Condensed Inventory of Ammonia Refrigerant\n\nCONDENSED INVENTORY OF AMMONIA REFRIGERANT\n\nMain System (Cold Rooms, Equipment Yard, Water Chillers)    11,400 lb\n\nRefrigeration Trailer GGF-RT1-1109    1,250 lb\n\nRefrigeration Trailer GGF-RT2-1109    1,250 lb\n\nVacuum Tube System (FC RT-1214, Vacuum Tubes FC T-1214A FC T-1214B)    3,000 lb\n\nTotal On-Site Charge    16,900 lb\n\n\n\n2.4. Safe Operating Conditions and Consequences of Deviation\n\nThe refrigeration system piping is a closed loop designed to operate at two pressures. The design pressures and system safety set points are shown on Table V.3. All high side equipment and piping has been tested and certified for 250 psig (85?F). All low side equipment and piping has been tested and certified for 250 psig (85?F). The purging system should prevent outside contamination effecting chemical composition or flows. Higher pressures could result from contaminants in the system.\n\nTable V.2.

Appendix A.1?IIAR Checklists\n\n?    Appendix A.7?Technical Operating Specifications\n\n3. Process Equipment\n\n3.1. Materials of Construction?Ammonia System\n\nAll materials used for fabrication of equipment and piping is certified as suitable for use in an ammonia refrigeration system. Carbon steel is the primary material used for contact with ammonia in vessels, piping, and equipment. Some room evaporators have aluminum coils and there are some miscellaneous materials such as stainless steel valve stems, Teflon valve seats, and carbon seals. An ?Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklist? from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) was completed for each piece of equipment and for the system in general to check suitability of all components for use with ammonia refrigeration. These checklists are in Appendix A.1.\n\n3.2. Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)\n\nA system schematic has been developed to show the equipment connections and general process flow directions. Piping, equipment, and major controls are shown on this diagram. For detailed refrigeration system drawings and P&IDs, see Appendix A.2.\n\n3.3. Electrical Classification\n\nThe refrigeration equipment is classified as non-hazardous. Code requirements for this classification require that no electrical equipment other than required motors, and automatic controls operation switches and ventilation be used in the machinery room. Since facility has no machinery room, this is not applicable for this facility.\n\n3.4. Relief System Design\n\nRelief valves protect both the high and low sides from over pressurization. At each vessel (except the oil pots, which require only one relief valve due to their size) there are two relief valves attached to a 3-way valve. One valve is active while the other is inactive. This enables changing out relief valves without pumping down the vessel. Most of the high and low side relief valves are factory set to release at 250 psig. Some relief valves such as oil pots and compressor relief valves are set to release at 300 psig. The system relief valves are piped to a diffusion tank to prevent releases to atmosphere. Relief valves shall be tested or replaced once every five years. For a detailed overview of the relief system design, see Appendix A.8.\n\n3.5. Ventilation System Design\n\nFacility has no machinery room. All of the refrigeration equipment except the cold room evaporators are located outdoors. Therefore there is no ventilation system installed.\n\n3.6. Design Codes and Standards\n\nThe refrigeration system was constructed in 2013 as per current codes. The refrigeration system at the facility is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operating in a safe manner for its intended use. A code compliance review of the existing system with respect to current codes and standards is presented in Appendix A.3. The purpose of the code compliance review is to document that the system complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices and includes the following codes and standards\n\n?    California Mechanical Code, 2016 Edition\n\n?    California Fire Code, 2016 Edition\n\n?    ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15: Safety Standard for Refrigeration Systems, 2016 Ed.\n\n?    IIAR Bulletin No. 109?Guidelines for: IIAR Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\n3.7. Material and Energy Balances\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the facility is a closed system and, under normal operating conditions, the hazardous material ammonia is neither added to nor consumed from the system. Therefore, material balances are not required. Addition of ammonia is required if, and when, new equipment is added to the system. Such equipment additions generally provide notable increases in system capacity, which requires additional refrigerant. The facility maintains ammonia inventory logs that keep track of these additions, which can be found in Appendix A.6.\n\nEnergy balances, however, are required as energy is transferred through the system. Heat is essentially transferred out of a process and released into the atmosphere. A detailed energy balance has been conducted and can be found in Appendix A.9.\n\n3.8. Safety Systems: Detection, Monitoring, and Controls\n\nSystem Controls\n\nThe compressors are controlled by local microprocessor control panels. Capacity is controlled by operating the compressor unloading and loading based on suction pressure. Shutdown limits exist for low suction pressure, high discharge pressure, temperature, low discharge pressure, and high oil temperature. There is also a differential pressure control for oil pressure failure. If the differential between oil pressure and compressor suction pressure becomes too large, the compressor will stop, preventing damage to the machine. If a compressor fails, it is locked out and the system control starts another machine. \n\nLiquid ammonia reaching the refrigeration compressors could cause equipment failure. The low pressure receiver captures any liquid carry over from the cold room evaporators and chiller surge drums thus protecting the compressor from liquid slugging. Vacuum tube surge drum outlets (dry suction) connected directly to the compressor suction header. The low pressure receiver has a high-level float switch that triggers local audio visual alarm. However, this HLFS does not shut down the compressors. Hard wiring HLFS to compressor shut down is added as corrective items. Surge drums on the vacuum tubes have high level float switches as well but they shut down the liquid feed only. Adding a suction accumulator with HLFS or compressor shut down at high liquid level is recommended. \n\nAmmonia Detection\n\nAll cold room are installed with electrochemical type ammonia sensors. The low-level set point triggers visual lights and audible alarms. All set points and alarms functions meet or exceed the requirements of the California Mechanical Code. Ammonia detectors are located in the cold rooms as shown in Appendix A.2. Installation of additional ammonia sensors  in the equipment yard, at diffusion tank vent line and and on the trailers is recommended.\n\n?    Cold Rooms Ammonia Sensors\n\n?    High-Level is set at 25 ppm (alarming level)\n\nPressure Relief Valves\n\nThe purpose of the pressure relief valves (PRVs) is to automatically reduce the pressure in a system when it exceeds the pressure stamped on the PRV. PRVs are installed at each vessel. The outlet or Relief Vent (RV) of each PRV is piped to a common RV. The RV is terminated at the Ammonia Diffusion Tank, which is described below.\n\nOn the low-pressure receiver package piping, reseating relief regulators are installed at the discharge of each ammonia pumps between check valve and the shut-off valve. This regulator provides protection against expansion of liquid that may be trapped. The regulators automatically reduce the pressure in the given line when it exceeds the pressure stamped on the regulator. The relief regulators are designed to operate against a backpressure of which is relieved back into the low-pressure receiver.\n\nAmmonia Diffusion Tank (ADT)\n\nThe ammonia diffusion tank contains standing water that acts to dilute and neutralize ammonia discharges from PRVs during excessively high-pressure situations. This automatically vented ammonia is piped to the bottom of the tank and disperses through a drilled diffusion pipe. Ammonia is absorbed into the water as ammonia bubbles travel upwards through the water column. The benefit of this measure is to reduce the possibility of an ammonia release to atmosphere.\n\n3.9. Seismic Evaluation\n\nA seismic evaluation was performed to determine the presence and adequacy of equipment and piping seismic restraints and supports. The results of this evaluation is presented in Appendix A.10.\n\n\n\nNote: All references above may be found within the onsite facility RMP.",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe GreenGate Fresh, LLLP facility acts as a stationary source for regulated substance anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling, water chilling and vacuum cooling operations. The facility operates seasonally April through October as produce precooling, processing, cold storage and shipping. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to facility drawings in Appendix A.2.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards in 2013 as part of the newly constructed GreenGate Fresh, LLLP facility.

The fixed equipment includes, pressure vessels ammonia pumps, evaporative condenser, room evaporators, diffusion tank, ammonia sensors, control system and related piping. Portable equipment includes three refrigeration high side trailers, two half car vacuum tubes and a compressor skid.  High side trailers have evaporative condenser, screw compressor(s) and high pressure receiver. Portable equipment stays onsite seasonally between April through October. The main high pressure receiver, low pressure receiver three chillers, and evaporators stay on site all the time. All refrigeration equipment, except room evaporators, are located outdoors. At the end of the operating season, all ammonia charge is pumped down to high pressure receiver and low pressure receiver and stays on site.\n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Cold room evaporators are controlled by the Refrigeration Control Panel located in electrical room. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming and notifying fire alarm company which notifies the facility manager if the ammonia vapor detected in the cold room. Ammonia detection controller is located in fire alarm panel room. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. Low pressure receiver triggers a local audio visual alarm if the high liquid level is reached in the vessel. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry from this system is shown in Section V.A.2. The total ammonia charge of approximately 16,900 lb is completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\n\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in App"

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists\", located in Appendix A.1, describe equipment details. Sheets 2.0 and 2.1 in Appendix A.2 show the refrigeration equipment layout.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation.\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP is a \"Non-Responding facility\". Facility is only respond to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Facility Managers, RMP administrator and designated Emergency Responders as outlined in Section VI.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.

All the compressors are controlled by local microprocessors which shuts down the compressors if the operating conditions exceeds the normal operating limits. The facility has ammonia detectors in the cold rooms that triggers audio visual alarm inside the cold room notifying the employee of an ammonia leak. Monitoring is 24 hours per day during the operating season. The relief valves in the system are all tied into the diffusion tank.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP was constructed and started operation in 2013. On October 23, 2017 a release occurred causing onsite evacuation of personnel and offsite consequences. The release emanated from screw compressor #1 on the GGF-RT 12/14 high side trailer. The oil separator man-way gasket failed releasing approximately 1,871 lb of anhydrous ammonia. The equipment failed on the manway cover gasket as it was pushed out between the cover and the separator. Neighboring businesses also evacuated due to the release. The Salinas Fire Dept. was contacted upon discovery. The release was mitigated within an hour by the facility refrigeration contractor and the Fire Dept. allowed resumption of operation thereafter. There were four GreenGate employees who received medical attention at a nearby hospital, complaining of respiratory issues. All four were released following medical examination and went to work the following day. An Incident Investigation was initiated by a team of qualified personnel. A copy of the detailed Incident Investigation is maintained onsite and readily available upon request. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency action plan and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the "

The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. Description of the emergency action plan is included in Appendix N.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\n\nNote: All references above may be found within the onsite facility RMP.\n\n"
