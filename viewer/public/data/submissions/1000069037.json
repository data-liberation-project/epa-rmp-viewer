Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\n\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe GreenGate Fresh, LLLP facility acts as a stationary source for regulated substance anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia system is used for cold storage and produce pre-cooling, water chilling and vacuum cooling operations. The facility operates seasonally April through October as produce precooling, processing, cold storage and shipping. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to facility drawings in Appendix A.2.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards in 2013 as part of the newly constructed GreenGate Fresh, LLLP facility.

The fixed equipment includes, pressure vessels ammonia pumps, evaporative condenser, room evaporators, diffusion tank, ammonia sensors, control system and related piping. Portable equipment includes three refrigeration high side trailers, two half car vacuum tubes and a compressor skid.  High side trailers have evaporative condenser, screw compressor(s) and high pressure receiver. Portable equipment stays onsite seasonally between April through October. The main high pressure receiver, low pressure receiver three chillers, and evaporators stay on site all the time. All refrigeration equipment, except room evaporators, are located outdoors. At the end of the operating season, all ammonia charge is pumped down to high pressure receiver and low pressure receiver and stays on site.\n\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Cold room evaporators are controlled by the Refrigeration Control Panel located in electrical room. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms for alarming and notifying fire alarm company which notifies the facility manager if the ammonia vapor detected in the cold room. Ammonia detection controller is located in fire alarm panel room. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. Low pressure receiver triggers a local audio visual alarm if the high liquid level is reached in the vessel. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry from this system is shown in Section V.A.2. The total ammonia charge of approximately 16,900 lb is completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\n\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in App"

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists\", located in Appendix A.1, describe equipment details. Sheets 2.0 and 2.1 in Appendix A.2 show the refrigeration equipment layout.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation.\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP is a \"Non-Responding facility\". Facility is only respond to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Facility Managers, RMP administrator and designated Emergency Responders as outlined in Section VI.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.

All the compressors are controlled by local microprocessors which shuts down the compressors if the operating conditions exceeds the normal operating limits. The facility has ammonia detectors in the cold rooms that triggers audio visual alarm inside the cold room notifying the employee of an ammonia leak. Monitoring is 24 hours per day during the operating season. The relief valves in the system are all tied into the diffusion tank.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nGreenGate Fresh, LLLP was constructed and started operation in 2013. On October 23, 2017 a release occurred causing onsite evacuation of personnel and offsite consequences. The release emanated from screw compressor #1 on the GGF-RT 12/14 high side trailer. The oil separator man-way gasket failed releasing approximately 1,871 lb of anhydrous ammonia. The equipment failed on the manway cover gasket as it was pushed out between the cover and the separator. Neighboring businesses also evacuated due to the release. The Salinas Fire Dept. was contacted upon discovery. The release was mitigated within an hour by the facility refrigeration contractor and the Fire Dept. allowed resumption of operation thereafter. There were four GreenGate employees who received medical attention at a nearby hospital, complaining of respiratory issues. All four were released following medical examination and went to work the following day. An Incident Investigation was initiated by a team of qualified personnel. A copy of the detailed Incident Investigation is maintained onsite and readily available upon request. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency action plan and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the "

The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. Description of the emergency action plan is included in Appendix N.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n\n\nNote: All references above may be found within the onsite facility RMP.\n\n"
