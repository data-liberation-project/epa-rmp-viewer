If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the local surroundings.\n\n\nFACILITY IMFORMATION\n\n*Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for sale to growers.\n*The maxium quantity of stored anhydrous ammonia would be 200,000 pounds.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release from the largest vessel identified as holding 145,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia liquified under pressure by design standards. By using RMP Comp it was determined that a release of this would meet the endpoint of 5.6 miles. The impact would be on residents of about 38 people.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative case release of anhydrous ammonia was to demonstrate a ruptured anhydrous transfer hose while off-loading. The case would show a release of 11,908 pounds of ammonia over a 2 minute period with an effect of a reading of 2.5 miles to the toxic endpoing. Estimated receptors would be 12 people. \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nIt was found that there has been no accidents or reportable off-premisee release at this facility. The emergency response program is on file with the Local Emergency Planning Coordinator. Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the Radium Coop. Evaluations of anhydrous ammonia are periodically performed to assess the safety of our equipment."
