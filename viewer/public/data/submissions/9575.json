The \nmixture is used as a propellant for aerosol paint cans.\n\nFinished goods are transferred to the warehouse for interim storage.  \nMixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids are stored in \n12- or 18-ounce cans.  Approximately 1,000,000 pounds of propellant may \nbe stored in the well-protected warehouse at any one time.\n\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is \nnot inherently toxic.\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIO\n2.1\tWORST-CASE SCENARIO\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, a worst-case release from the \nlargest single container was analyzed to assess the maximum distance to \nthe flammable endpoint.  The release scenarios analyzed and the \nendpoints evaluated are based on the guidance contained in the USEPA\u0012s \nRisk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (the \n\u0013Propane Guidance\u0014), dated March 4, 1999, and the USEPA\u0012s Offsite \nConsequence Analysis Guidance (\u0013OCAG\u0014), dated April 1999.\n\nThe worst-case scenario assumes that failure of the largest single \ncontainer, an 18-ounce aerosol can, results in a release of propellant and \nflammable liquid vapor.  The released material is assumed to form a vapor \ncloud which comes into contact with an ignition source and detonates.  \nThe endpoint for this release is defined as an overpressure of 1 pound per \nsquare inch caused by the explosion and is considered the threshold for \npotential serious injuries to people as a result of property damage caused \nby an explosion.

No public receptors are located \nwithin the endpoint distance.  \n3.0\tACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Rust-Oleum \nPleasant Prairie warehouse in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, \ninjury, or significant property damage on site; or off-site death, injury, \nproperty damage, evacuation , sheltering in place, or environmental \ndamage.\n4.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by \nthe RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational \ncontrols are in place to decrease the severity or prevent the occurrence of a \nfire or explosion.  The most significant controls are described below:\n\n  The warehouse is designed as an aerosol warehouse in accordance \nwith the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Manufacture and \nStorage of Aerosol Products code (NFPA 30B).\n\n  Aerosol storage is limited to two pallets high within the warehouse.\n\n  All electrical equipment meets the requirements of the National Electric \nCode (NFPA 70).\n\n  The warehouse is fully sprinklered using an early suppression fast \nresponse system.\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Rust-Oleum, Pleasant Prairie facility has implemented a detailed \nwritten Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all \nemergencies at the facility, including incidents related to a release of \npropellant.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for plant employees, \ncoordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel \nin the facility.  The EAP identifies specific individuals and their \nresponsibilities, and identifies procedures for emergency medical care.\n\nAdditionally, the Rust-Oleum manufacturing facility, located less than one \ncity block from the off-site warehouse, has a trained and well-equipped \nhazardous material"
