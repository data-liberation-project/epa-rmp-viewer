Sale Ranch processes flammable gas and liquid mixtures in an amount greater than the threshold quantify containing any of the following RMP-regulated constituents:\r\n\u00bf\tMethane\r\n\u00bf\tEthane\r\n\u00bf\tPropane\r\n\u00bf\tIsobutane\r\n\u00bf\tButane\r\n\u00bf\tIsopentane\r\n\u00bf\tPentane\r\n\r\nThe only RMP-regulated toxic constituent present at Sale Ranch, which is part of the amine treating process for the sites' liquid product, is hydrogen sulfide; however, quantities at this facility are well below the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nWTG is committed to ensuring a safe work environment for all its employees, contractors, and vendors.  The Sale Ranch Gas Plant has a detailed Emergency Action Plan in which it has coordinated with the community's local responders through mock emergency simulations in order to introduce the local responders to the facility and its personnel.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe Sale Ranch process is covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals (PSM) regulation.

Thus, the current PSM improvement initiative is heavily focused on this key element as employees are becoming more actively involved in the implementation of each element of PSM.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nComprehensive reviews of the available process safety information (PSI) have been conducted.  Updates to maximum intended inventory (MII) and piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been completed as a result of a September 24, 2018 incident that resulted in significant damage to the front end of the gas plant.  This incident led to a redesign and rebuild of the inlet processing equipment at the plant, which was shut down from September 24, 2018 until January 17, 2019.  Additional information about this incident is discussed in the Five-Year Accident History section.  A comprehensive electronic web-based system utilized for timely access to information has been built, implemented, and made available to all personnel involved with operating the process.  The updated MII and P&IDs are available in this electronic web-based system, as well as other pertinent process information. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nA PHA that included experienced operating personnel (operations and maintenance), WTG engineers, Process Control personnel, safety representatives, and PSM representatives was utilized to conduct a new PHA in June 2018.  Results and recommendations from these analyses were shared with employees.

The status of all PHA items from the June 2018 and December 2018 PHAs are being maintained in the process safety tracking tool.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nWritten operating procedures referencing PSI are available in the site project books.  Operating procedures were updated prior to restart of Sale Ranch in January 2019 and operators were trained prior to the restart of the updated facility.  A technical review of the updated operating procedures is on-going to ensure current operations are reflected and to incorporate the various modes of process operations.  Completed procedures are published to the company's electronic web-based system.  In addition, a mentorship training program has been implemented.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):\r\nImprovements to the MOC procedure and associated checklists are in progress to capture all process related changes.  Requirements for the identification, evaluation, control, and authorization of modifications to plant design and operations prior to the implementation to ensure that the risk of new or existing hazards are properly managed is available to all personnel.  Extensive PSSR checklists for applicable disciplines (electrical, instrumentation, procedures, etc.) have been developed and implemented.  These checklists are Appendices to the Company's MOC procedure and are available online from the company's electronic web-based process library.

As part of WTG's PSM improvement program initiative, incident investigation procedures are being reviewed and will be updated as necessary.  A mix of WTG personnel will be provided investigation methodology training to further enhance the program and ensure root cause is consistently identified.  A process safety tracking tool has been developed and implemented to track action items and incident investigation corrective actions to closure. \r\n\r\nDepending on the severity of a given incident, WTG will contract with third-party contractors that specialize in incident investigations to perform this task and such was the case with the September 24, 2018 incident.  The incident investigation began on September 25, 2018 with an on-site investigation at the scene of the incident.  The scene investigation included thorough documentation of the scene, evidence identification, and reviews of witnesses and facility documentation. This evidence was used to identify the root cause, direct cause, and contributing factors to the incident by the incident investigation team.  The investigation team, lead by the third party contractor, also made several recommendations to prevent recurrence of the incident and enhance emergency response capabilities.  Most of these recommendations had already been designated as part of WTG's PSM improvement initiative.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nTo meet compliance with PSM, WTG conducts compliance audits every three years to verify all PSM element requirements are being satisfied.

Sale Ranch conducts mock emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations and the facility will conduct additional emergency drills annually with local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  The emergency response plan was last updated on February 11, 2019.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nA primary"

      "SummaryText": "loss of containment incident occurred on September 24, 2018 when a ball valve assembly failed, resulting in the release of inlet field gas at high pressure.  The released gas contacted an ignition source that resulted in a fire.  Sale Ranch operators had begun an Emergency Shutdown (ESD) immediately upon detection of the gas release.   Field inlet gas was shut down by the shutdown of the surrounding compressor stations feeding the gas plant.  As the field gas could not be isolated from the process, it served as fuel to the fire which lasted for 17 hours.  The fire resulted in significant onsite property damage at the inlet to the gas plant with no operator or contractor deaths or injuries.  There are no known offsite impacts.  Therefore, this incident is being reported under the RMP accident history reporting requirements but does not affect the program level status of the site per 40 CFR 68.10(f)(1).\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nWTG Sale Ranch will continue to improve its safety and environmental performance through emphasis on the continued development of it's PSM Program.  Improvement plans include process engineering support to update critical PSI data for the site; operating procedures written for each mode of operation and to include consequences of deviations; an operator certification training program established from the new operating procedures, new process hazard analysis (PHA) procedure and team structure ensuring employee involvement, new MI program incorporating the implementation of all new inspection procedures and frequencies all to be carefully reviewed, and recommendations for improvement generated using WTG's new compliance audit process."
