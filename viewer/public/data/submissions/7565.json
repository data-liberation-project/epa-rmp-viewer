An inadvertent release of vinyl acetate to the atmosphere may reach public receptors surrounding the facility.  Vinyl Acetate is heavier than air and seeks low areas.  It is a colorless gas and impacts public health when inhaled above the toxic end point as defined within 40 CFR 68.22. \n\nOSI Sealants uses vinyl acetate monomer as a reactant with other raw materials to make latex polymer emulsions.  This stationary source is the process that polymerizes one or more monomers in an atmospheric, batch reactor.  The reaction is controlled by the rate of catalyst and activator added, and by controlling the reactor temperature.   \n\nVinyl Acetate is stored in a tank farm outside the process building and is pumped to the reactor located inside the process building.  The storage tank is 22,600 gallons capacity and is enclosed with a secondary containment structure that holds the total contents of the tank. \n\nMaximum inventory is 22,600 gallons or 175,430 pounds and exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds.\n \nOFFSITE HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nFailing to control the toxic substance and releasing it offsite, EPA requires that the facility provide an offsite hazard assessment and consequence analysis.  This must include analyzing two release scenarios (Worse Case and Alternate Case) to determine the toxic end point.  \n\nToxic end point is based on ERPG-2 concentrations developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  The ERPG-2 is a maximum air borne concentration in which is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.  The AIHA has identified v"

      "SummaryText": "inyl acetate's toxic end point as .26 mg/l.\n\nWorse Case is releasing in ten minutes the entire contents of vinyl acetate from the storage tank into the containment area. The worse case scenario is rupture of the tank due to corrosion, impact, or construction defects. The containment area will hold the released quantity and is a passive mitigating factor in calculating the toxic end point.  The toxic end point is calculated with EPA's RMP*Comp software.   The toxic end point of the worse case scenario is .7 mile radius from the Polymer building.  Modeling does not include the effects of fires, chemical reactions, site topography, and other factors.  \n\nAlternate Case is more likely to occur than the Worse Case.  Alternate scenario is venting of vinyl acetate vapor from the reactor to the atmosphere during an upset of a batch operation. Operator's response time to stop the leak is approximately 20 minutes. Maximum venting rate is 70 pounds/min. The toxic end point of this alternate case is 0.1 mile radius from the Polymer building.\n\nThe Topographic Map in Appendix E shows the radius of exposure for the toxic endpoints.\n\nPREVENTION OF VINYL ACETATE RELEASE\n\nThe process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety Information that is a part of Process Safety Management (PSM.).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle vinyl acetate, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling and operating procedures that we use, and training of our personnel.   Prevention Program 3 (PSM) as described in 40 CFR Part 68 is followed to accomplish these goals and will minimize the potential for an unplanned release of vinyl acetate to the environment.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the past five years, no accidental releases have occurred.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDespite the Prevention"

An Emergency Response Program is in place to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release, thereby protecting the public health and the environment.   \n\nEmployee training is conducted as follows:\n* HAZWOPER\n* Hazard Communication\n* Process Safety Management\n* Hazardous Waste Generator\n* Employee Safety Briefings\n* Hazmat \n\nIn addition, the Plant works with community emergency responders (LaGrange Fire Department) to ensure that they are suitably trained and drilled in emergency response for vinyl acetate release. The HAZWOPER Emergency Response Plan is included in Appendix D. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR IMPROVED SAFETY \n\nThe Polymer Process Plant was constructed in 1984.  The facility complies with latest codes and standards that are applicable to this industry.   We continue to modify our operations to improve safety."
