The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n4) Training:  All employees that work at the facility and handle NGL participate in a training program.  Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures) and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three years.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.  Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations or industry standards.  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n6) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of NGL.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \n\n7) Incident Investigation:  Facility management will investigate each incident that results in , or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of NGL.

The vapor cloud fire would result from dispersion of a cloud of flammable vapor and ignition of the cloud following dispersion.  The rule specifies endpoints for fires based on the heat radiation level that may cause second degree burns from a 40 second exposure and the lower flammability limit (LFL), which is the lowest concentration in air at which a substance will burn.  The quantity of NGL released would be approximately 15,400 pounds, which is based on a release rate of 7,699 pounds per minute over a two minute time period, which is the time estimated it would take to detect the release and shut off the valves.  The resulting dispersion distance to the LFL concentration endpoint (0.1 miles) extends offsite and no public or environmental receptors were found to be within the distance to the endpoint.  The nearest public receptor is a residence located approximately 0.27 miles southwest of the facility.  There were no administrative controls or passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.  There was one active mitigation measure considered in this scenario and that was the manual shutting of valves to limit the release quantity.  The method and release rate was determined from procedures presented in EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (EPA 550-B-99-009).  Standard"

All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the NGL storage and process equipment are maintained at the facility. \n\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of NGL.

The maximum quantity of NGL released would be approximately 57,000 pounds.  Using the RMP*Comp model, with required default parameters, the distance to a 1 pound per square inch overpressure level resulting from the explosion of the vapor cloud is 0.3 miles.  The resulting distance (0.3 miles) extends offsite and a public receptor is within the distance to the endpoint.  The public receptor is a residence located approximately 0.27 miles southwest of the facility.  No environmental receptors were identified within the distance to the endpoint.  There was one administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the storage tank is not filled more than 90% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario (e.g., blast wall).\n\nRMP*Comp is one of the methods listed in EPA\u00bfs General Guidance for Risk Management Programs document (EPA 550-B-98-003) that can be used to complete the offsite consequence analyses required under the Risk Management Program rule.  RMP*Comp is a free program from the EPA that is simple to use and does not require hand calculations.  Standard default parameters required for the flammable worst-case release scenario and in RMP*Comp were used (e.g., release and explosion occur at ground level, release is total quantity of the flammable substance which forms a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits and the cloud detonates, ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud participates in the explosion, and release rate and duration are not considered).

Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of NGL in the past five years  that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of NGL except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).  The facility Emergency Action Plan was developed following the requirements found in OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, and is reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.  The plan has been coordinated with the community emergency response plan and the local emergency response agencies.

Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the handling and compression of natural gas.  As part of the facility operation, natural gas liquid (NGL) is separated from the natural gas stream, stored under pressure on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The NGL is the regulated flammable mixture at the facility and contains methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, pentane and isopentane.  These regulated flammable chemicals have a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds each.  The maximum stored quantity of the flammable mixture at the facility is approximately 57,000 pounds stored in one 12,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 90% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by two automatic pressure relief valves, a back pressure regulator and a high level shutdown.
