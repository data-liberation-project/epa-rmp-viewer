This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Sheldon Township Fire District  which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass High Technology Chemical Manufacturing.  We have nine (9) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid), Methyl chloroformate, Formaldehyde, Muriatic acid (Hydrochloric acid),  Monoisopropylamine (Isopropylamine), Dimethylamine, Ethylenediamine, Ammonia and Ethyl Chloride.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Oleum (24% solution) and Formaldehyde (30% Solution) are used to manufacture a water based additive.    Muriatic acid (32% solution) and Ethylenediamine (99% solution) are used for Dye & Pigment manufacturing.  Monoisopropylamine (70% solution) and  Methyl chloroformate (97% solution)  are used for manufacturing Herbicides.  Dimethylamine (40% solution) is used in manufacturing an intermediate chemical for sale to other manufacturers.   Ammonia (29% solution) is used for both Herbicide and Dye & Pigment manufacturing.
