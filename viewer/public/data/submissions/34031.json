      "SummaryText": "ITW Dymon operates an industrial/institutional maintenance product manufacturing facility in the south part of Olathe, Kansas. The facility is located just south of East Old 56 Highway, and approximately 1/4 mile west of Interstate 35. The nature of our business involves blending chemical raw materials at ambient temperature and pressure to form maintenance products for commerical distribution. Some of the products we manufacture are packaged in hand held aerosol spray containers. We store liquefied propane and isobutane gas for use as propellant. The horizontal storage aboveground pressure vessels (APVs), referred to as A-49 and A-110 and located southwest of the main facility structure, are used to store the isobutane and propane. The propellant storage and charging equipment constitute a Program Level 3 process for purposes of complying with the RMP regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition to the propellant storage and charging process, we also have a warehouse area which is dedicated to storage of aerosol products. This is a specially caged area (with ceiling to floor chain link fence) along our facility main building's southeast corner. This area stores only hand held aerosol spray cans, the largest of which contains approximately 1.5 pounds of propellant and product. The finished aerosol product storage area constitutes a Program Level 1 process for purposes of complying with the RMP regulatory requirements.\n\nITW Dymon is committed to maintaining our propellant storage and charging equipment in safe condition, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating prectices. This facility has never had an accidental release of propane or isobutane from our facility which resulted in adverse health effects to the public or to our employees, or to damage to property.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nOur Safety Team, our Plant Maintenance Supervisor, and all our employees are dedicated to maintaining our propellant storage and charging system"

      "SummaryText": "in a safe manner. We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention program, leading directly to the Maintenance Manager and the Plant Manager. We maintain current safety information on propane and isobutane, and our propellant charging equipment, and review any potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and potential use of the propellants at our facility. In addition, we train both our operating and maintenance personnel in our procedures and safe practices. New employees are trained before being allowed to work alone, and periodic refresher training is provided to all employees. Any time significant changes occurr in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of propellant, affected employees are retrained. We inspect and audit our facility, using both in house staff and trained professionals from outside our company.\n\nEMERGENCY REPONSE\n\nBecause propane and isobutane are flammable substances above EPA's CAA Risk Management Program threshold quantity, the ITW Dymon Olathe facility is required to 1) develop an emergency response program including a written emergency response plan; or 2) coordinate response actions with the Olathe, Kansas Fire Department.\n\nThe Olathe facility employees are not qualified to respond to an uncontrolled or catastrophic release of propane or isobutane. The Safety Director has notified the Olathe Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit that in the event of a release where potentially catastrophic amounts of propane are released, facility personnel will be instructed to leave the facility, and a 24 hour emergency response contractor will be notified, in addition ot 911."
