Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committees, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.\n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes every effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces maleic anhydride by the oxidation of butane and air in the presence of a catalyst.  Butane is the single regulated substance handled above the regulatory threshold quantity.  Butane is piped to the facility as a raw material from the Catlettsburg Refinery into three storage tanks.  The facility also receives supplemental truck deliveries of butane.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.

Vapor cloud explosions are extremely rare events, even when large quantities of flammable materials are released.   Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario for butane could potentially affect offsite receptors.  In the worst-case analysis, a restricted volume was considered as an administrative control.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenario for butane could possibly impact offsite public receptors.  In the alternative-case analysis, a restricted volume was considered as an administrative control and an excess flow valve was considered as an active mitigation measure.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  These  procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.

We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.
