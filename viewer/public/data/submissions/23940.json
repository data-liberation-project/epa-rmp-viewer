Hopefully through continued plant maintainence and employee training, an accidental release will not occur.  If, however, an accidental release should occur it is our policy to notify the Sutherland Community Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility description and the regulated substance handled:     This facility is a fertilizer plant and is operated as such by the local agricultural cooperative.  The facility handles annhydrous ammonia for use as fertilizer by its farmer members.  The plant has permanent anhydrous ammonia storage capacity of 30,000 gallons which puts the plant into the regulated catagory.  Along with the permanent storage tank and associated valves, piping, etc.  We use nurse tanks and applicators for our farmers to transport and inject the ammonia into the ground.\n\nWorst case scenario:    Our worst case scenario would be if the 30,000 gallon tank was filled to allowable capacity and for some reason would rupture.  This could conceivably result in the release of 160,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  According to EPA look-up tables the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles where in this rural enviroment 1548 people reside.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention program:    This facility complies with all Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (ANSI K6 1.1) guidelines published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  In addition to these standards it is our policy to continually maintain and update our equiptment to all current state and federal anhydrous ammonia handling guidelines.  We also maintain a continuing education and safety education program for all empl"

A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. A written emergency response propgram, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:   \n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to asses the maintence of safe conditions.\n\nThere are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
