It complies with all applicable State and Federal regulations and provides training and equipment to operate in a safe and efficient manner.  An implementation manual incorporating the requirements of RMP has been prepared and is used as the working document for compliance with the RMP regulations.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan and works closely with the local volunteer fire department and the LEPC to ensure coordination of local emergency responders and public notification in the event of a chemical release. \n\n\n\nBuckeye manufactures vinyl acetate resins at the Maryland Heights, MO facility.  The vinyl acetate monomer process consists of 148,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer inside one atmospheric tank. Multiple passive and active mitigation systems are included in the process, as discussed herein.  The worst case scenario used to assess off-site consequences assumes the release of the atmospheric tank, which would result in 148,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer being released. \n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario used to assess off-site consequences assumes the release of a tanker during unloading, which could result in 47,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer being released. \n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped to the facility by tanker truck and unloaded using a dedicated atmospheric storage tank.  The storage tank and unloading area are each located in a diked storage area.  Vinyl acetate monomer is transferred as needed from the atmospheric tank.  The production process is a batch process, and includes mixing/blending tanks, reactors and cooling vessels in a single train.  Upon completion of the reactor and cooling stage, the vinyl acetate monomer is no longer present.  \n\n\n\nThe surrounding area is primarily industrial/commercial, with residential housing units (mainly single family homes) located to the north and east of the facility.
