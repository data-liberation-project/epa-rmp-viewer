      "SummaryText": "The City of Lancaster Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWWTP) is owned and operated by the City of Lancaster for the sole purpose of treating wastewater, which is a combination of residential, commercial, and industrial used water discharges.\n\nThe City\u00bfs AWWTP collects wastewater from the City of Lancaster and portions of Manheim Township, Lancaster Township, East and West Lampeter Townships, Strasburg Borough, Upper Leacock Township, West Earl Township, Manor Township, and Pequea Township.  Upon collection and arrival at the AWWTP, wastewater is physically treated through screening and primary clarification, in which inorganic and organic solids are removed.\n\nBiological treatment of the wastewater follows primary clarification.  The biological treatment of wastewater further removes organic material as well as the nutrients ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus.  Final clarification then separates the mixture of wastewater and active biological solids.  The majority of biological solids (biosolids) are reused to treat incoming wastewater, but a portion of these biosolids are disposed of via reducing the water content and then landfilling.  Chlorine and Sodium Bisulfite are used to disinfect and dechlorinate the wastewater respectively.  After dechlorination, the processed wastewater is discharged to the Conestoga River.  The rated capacity of the AWWTP is 29.73 million gallons per day.  All materials used in processing wastewater and materials derived from wastewater are handled and disposed of properly.  Any materials that are found outside their containment area are promptly cleaned up, as to prevent environmental contamination in the form of stormwater, groundwater, air, or soil contamination.   \n\nTo prevent, prepare, and rectify chemical releases that pose an environmental or public health threat, the AWWTP utilizes the following:  City of Lancaster Emergency Management Plan, AWWTP Preparedness, Prevention and Contingincy (PPC) Plan, and the AWWTP\u00bfs Risk Manageme"

This exective summary focuses strictly on the AWWTP\u00bfs RMP.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III approved the AWWTP\u00bfs RMP during their compliance audit on April 14, 2000.  The RMP includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release of chlorine gas, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The emergency response program was developed by the Local Emergency Planning committee (LEPC) of Lancaster County and is updated yearly. \n\n\nRMP Summary:\n \nThe following Risk Management Program (RMP) quoted language has been taken directly from Environmental Publication (EPA) 550-B-98-010.  This publication has specific guidance requirements and calculation procedures for Wastewater Treatment Plants regulated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act.  The purpose of this RMP is to bring the City of Lancaster\u00bfs AWWTP into compliance with Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nDefinition Risk Management Program versus Risk Management Plan:\n\n\u00bfThe phrase \u00bfrisk management program\u00bf refers to all of the requirements of part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis.  The phrase \u00bfrisk management plan \u00bf refers to the document summarizing the risk management program that you must submit to EPA.\u00bf\n \nDue to the fact that the AWWTP is covered under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the following activities must be undertaken:\n\n\u00bfCovered facilities must develop and implement a RMP and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP will include and analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\u00bf \n\n\u00bfCovered facilities also must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan, which includes registration information, to EPA no later than June 21, 1999, or the date on which the facility first has more than a thresho"

Administrative limits are set for the maximum quantity stored on site.  If only one cylinder was used at a time, the City\u00bfs AWWTP would not be required to develop a Risk Management Program because they would be under the 2,500 pound threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of wastewater chlorinated at the Lancaster AWWTP, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together.  Since this manifold creates a process of 4,000 pounds, the AWWTP was required to develop a Risk Management Program.  The AWWTP's chlorination process ends when the Cl2 mixes with the process water.\n  \nStandard operating procedures at the Lancaster AWWTP direct personnel to only change chlorine when all chlorine is removed from the network by vacuum.  After all chlorine is drained for the system, two new cylinders are connected to the manifold.  At no time is there more than 4,000 pounds of chlorine within the process.\n\nSince it was determined that the Lancaster AWWTP has to develop a RMP and it falls under the classification of a Program 2, the following is required:\n\n(1)  Haza"

A catastrophic release is one that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.  Exhibit 6-10 briefly summarizes the steps you must take for investigation incidents.  You should also consider investigating minor accidents or near misses because they may help you identify problems that could lead to more serious accident; however, you are not required to do so under part 68.\u00bf    (6-29)\n\nThe Lancaster AWWTP will investigate all incidences that result in the release of chlorine within 48 hours.  All findings will be summarized in a report that will include the following information:\n\u00b7  Factors contributing to the incident\n\u00b7  Recommendation for corrective actions\n\nModifications, if applicable, will be made to the chlorination system and RMP to prevent further incidents.

This requirement applies if your employees will respond to some releases involving regulated substances.\u00bf (8-1)\n\nWhat is a response?\n\n\u00bfEPA interprets \u00bfresponse\u00bf to be consistent with the definition of response specified under OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER Standard.  OSHA defines emergency response as \u00bfa response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders\u00bf to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\u00bf  The key factor here is that responders are designated for such tasks by their employer.  This definition excludes \u00bfresponses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release are, or by maintenance personnel\u00bf  as well as \u00bf responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e.,"

This plan is updated each year by both the LEPC and the City of Lancaster."
