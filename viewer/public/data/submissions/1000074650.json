This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility. L'Oreal's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Well-defined safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including storage, handling, on-site movement of chemicals, or any combination of these activities listed.\n\n\n\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility located in South Brunswick, New Jersey, is a warehouse used for the distribution of cosmetic products. The facility currently receives and stores aerosol cans containing compressed gases and liquids.\n\n\n\nAerosol cans contain flammable mixtures. The flammable mixtures are found mainly as propellants in small quantities (in 6 to 10 ounce aerosol cans intended for use as household or salon products). The facility does not have any regulated toxic substances.\n\n\n\nThe facility is both an OSHA VPP Start site and OSHAS 18001 certified.\n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility is an EPA RMP Program 1 Level facility and a NJ TCPA Program 3 Level facility.\n\n\n\nIII. General Accident Release Prevention Program & Chemical -Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements.\n\n\n\n- Safety Information: The L'Oreal Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to ensure safe operation of the process. These documents address hazards of the aerosols at the facility, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n- Hazard Review: Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in plac"
