      "SummaryText": "Niacet Corporation (Niacet) began as a semi commercial chemical plant based on acetylene in 1924. The company is a privately owned corporation with approxmately 85 employees. The facility operates 24 hours per day 365 days per year. The facility occupies 19 acres in a commercial/industrial area. The facility is bordered by property owned by Praxair Corporation to the East. It is bordered by Niagara Falls Boulevard to the North and 47th Street to the West, and Simmons avenue to the South. The nearest residential area is approximately 0.5 miles to the NW. Niacet is a major producer of metal organic acid salts such as Calcium Propionate, Sodium Acetate, and Sodium Phenoxyacetate (SPA) which is used inn the production of Penicillin. Niacet produces Monochloroacetic acid which is a raw material for SPA, and is also sold on the merchant market. Chlorine is used to produce Monochloroacetic acid. Ethyl ether is used to manufacture SPA and anionic surfactants. Chlorine is received via railcar and transferred through a vaporizer into 1 of 2 reactors for the production of Monochloroacetic acid. Niacet may have up to 2 railcars on site for a total of 360,000 lbs. Safety systems include chlorine sensors, automatic shutoff valves, and video monitors.Ethyl ether is received via tank truck and is stored into 1 of 2 14,000 gallon storage tanks. In total the 2 tanks may contain up to 170,000 lbs. Ethyl ether is used in the manufacture of SPA and anionic surfactants. The ethyl ether is a processing aid which is recycled and reused in these processes. Safety systems include heat sensors that can activate a water deluge system, sprinklers, and LEL monitors and alarms. Niacet has a management system in place to oversee the implementation of the RMP program elements. The Manager, Quality Assurance & Regulatory Affairs has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation and integration of the RMP program elements.

      "SummaryText": "irectly to the Co- Managing Directors. He may assign responsibility of individual program elements to individuals identified in the Niacet organizational chart. Niacet is committed to operate our Niagara Falls, NY based facility in a safe and responsible manner. Our long history of no off site releases of regulated chemicals speaks for itself. This is due to the layers of safeguards in place to prevent the accidental release of hazardous substances. In the unlikely event of a chemical release, comprehensive emergencey response plans are in place to bring any situation to a safe resolution. Niacet meets regularly with emergency responders and conducts ongoing training of employees and emergency responders to be prepared in the unlikely event of an emergency situation. Accident prevention is a key element of our RMP plan. We take a systematic approach to preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Niacet's RMP plan includes the adoption of OSHA's accidental release prevention program. Some key elements include : Operating procedures, Process safety information, Process Hazards analysis, Training, Mechanical integrity, Incident investigation, Compliance audits, Management of Change, Contractor Management, Prestartup Review, and Employee Participation. Continual improvement is key to our success. This includes our joint Union/Management safety committee. Review of plant procedures, near misses, incident investigation programs, solicitation of suggestions, and the maintenance of regularly scheduled comprehensive safety meetings."
