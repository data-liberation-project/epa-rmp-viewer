This site is located in Wilbarger County near the city of Vernon, TX. The facility has 92 full time employees.\n\nWest Texas Utilities (WTU) is an investor-owned utility. The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility has a total generation of approximately 430 mw.  It burns coal as the primary fuel. The unit is a General Electric steam turbine generator with a Foster  Wheeler boiler installed in 1986.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the WTU Oklaunion Power Station.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Oklaunion Power Station has been producing electricity for about 13 years. During this time, there have not been any chlorine or ammonia releases that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community based upon extreme conditions defined by the governing agency, the Enviro"

A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest container of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (May 1996). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems is operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do not allow a complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Oklaunion Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine or a tank containing 45,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The entire quantity is released from one of these containers vaporizing over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 3.0 miles down wind for chlorine and 3.6 miles down wind for ammonia. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Oklaunion Power Station involves the failure of a  one-fourth inch pigtail or similar connection leaking chlorine for approximately 60 minutes. The resulting cloud extends 0.3 miles down wind. A similar alternative release scenario for ammonia involves the failure of a 2-inch diameter connection with a resulting cloud extending 0.5 miles down wind.\n\nWTU chlorinating and ammonia systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n - Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mec"
