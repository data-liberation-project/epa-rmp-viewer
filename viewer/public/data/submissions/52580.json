LES is a municipally-owned and operated electric utility with\nsole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska. As a publicly owned utility, LES operates and\nmaintains all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in\nconformance with the expectations of LES customer/owner's. LES strives for excellence in the facility\noperations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of LES policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk\nManagement Program LES is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and\nthe Risk Management Program defined in it. LES is committed to the accidental release prevention program.\nLES maintains a thorough detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release\nfor the Salt Valley Generating Station. The plan will be reviewed with response organizations and others.\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b)The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nThe LES Salt Valley Generating Station, owned and operated by LES, provides emergency, peaking and base\nload electric power generation. There are three LM 6000 dual fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines located\non the 320-acre site; one of which operates in simple cycle, and two operate in either simple cycle or combined\ncycle. The LM 6000 turbines are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx emission control.\nThis system uses anhydrous ammonia which is fed into the exhaust combustion gases upstream of the SCR\ncatalyst modules.\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a pressure vessel under ambient temperature. The pressure vessel "

As the result, the normal operating\namount of ammonia stored in the Salt Valley Generating Station is 10,200 gallons or 51,000 pounds.\n40 CFR 68.155(c)The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including\nAdministrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an oftisite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of\na regulated substance. In Salt Valley Generating Station's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated\nsubstance. Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous\nammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 2.\n\nEPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a\nvessel that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The largest quantity is determined by taking\ninto account administrative controls that limit the quantity of a substance that can be stored or processed in a\nvessel at any one time, or alternatively, procedures that occasionally allow the vessel to store greater than\nusual quantities. EPA defined alternative release scenarios to be any release that is more likely to occur than\nthe worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\nFor offsite consequence analysis, the movement and dispersion of a regulated substance release to the\natmosphere is predicted using the computer model called Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmosphere (ALOHA).\nALOHA predicts pollutant concentration downwind from the source, taking into consideration the physical\ncharacteristics of ammonia, the physical characteristics of the site, weather condition, and the circumstance of\nthe release.\n\nThe worst case scenario selected for the Salt Valley Generating Station is the loss of 51,000 pounds of\npressurized anhydrous ammonia represent"
