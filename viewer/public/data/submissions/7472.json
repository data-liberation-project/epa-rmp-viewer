BASF also believes in being a responsible corporate citizen and maintaining open, constructive dialogue with our neighbors.  These principles are an integral part of our corporate vision statement and values.  We believe that sharing this information with our neighbors makes good sense.  By doing so, we believe the community will better understand how safe and ecologically sound BASF operations are.\n\nPolicies\n\nBASF Corporation has the following Corporate Guidelines related to environmental, health and safety:\n\n7 We produce products that are safe to manufacture, use and dispose of.\n7 We assist our customers to use our products safely and in an environmentally sound manner.  We  provide them with information on correct handling of our products.\n7 We minimize the impact on mankind and the environment during production, storage, transportation, marketing and use of our products.\n7 Economic considerations do not take priority over environmental protection, health and safety.\n7 An important contribution to \"Sustainable Development\" is our involvement in the \"Responsible Care\" initiative worldwide.  This applies to our products and services in all our businesses and affiliates.\n7 We are committed to making continuous improvements in safety, health and environmental protection.  We do this acting on our own initiative and in consultation with recognized regulatory authorities.  We take any action judged to be necessary, whether or not dictated by statutory obligation or official regulations.\n7 We encourage safety, environmental and health awareness among employees.\n7 We regard it as an important corporate duty to advance science and technology in order to improve safety a"

Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for the production of synthetic leather tanning oils.  The products manufactured here are used in the textile and leather finishing industries.   Dyes and pigments for these industries are also mixed and shaded at the site.\n  \nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst Case\n7 The worst case scenario involves the release of chlorine from a railcar with off-site impacts.\n \nAlternative\n\n7 The alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is a  process line rupture, inside a dike, with off-site impacts. \n\nActive mitigation measures in place include an acrylonitrile detection and alarm system.\nThe dike surrounding the storage tank is a passive mitigation system.\n\n7 The alternative release scenario for chlorine is a  pipe leak, inside a process building, with off-site impact.\n\nActive mitigation measures in place include a chlorine detection and alarm system interlocked to the supply valve at the chlorine railcar. This limits the quantity released.\n\nFor this indoor release, the building is a passive mitigation measure  as the material is released to the atmosphere at the height of the building roof vent.\n\n7 The alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide is a vessel leak with off-site impacts.\n \nActive mitigation measures in place include a sulfur dioxide detection and alarm system.\n \nAccidenta"
