      "SummaryText": "3.0 Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at the Melrose plant, a release from the ammonia refrigeration system could potentially affect employees on-site and the general public off-site.  USEPA requires companies to use models for worst-case and alternate release scenarios for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur.  If a release occurred, however, the alternate scenario would be much more likely.\r\n\r\n4.0  General Accidental Release Prevetions Program and Chemical-Specific Prevetion Steps\r\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM program for the ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3.  The prevetion program is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Melrose Dairy Protein's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.\r\n\r\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\r\nA review of this facility's accidental release history shows there have been no releases in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\r\nThis facility has developed an emergency response program in which emergency communication, emergency evacuation procedures and an off-site plan in the envent of a hazardous substance release are addressed in detail.  \r\n\r\nFor a release which leaves the Melrose Dairy Proteins site, the company would work with local officials to notify neighbors so that appropriate safety precautions could be taken.  If ammonia is in the outside atmosphere, the safest place to be is indoors with the windows and doors shut and the ventilation system turned off."

      "SummaryText": "1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Melrose Dairy Proteins facility in Melrose, Minnesota has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia.  This facility has an electronic preventative maintenance system which uses a real time database to track preventative maintenance, training and inspection dates, and issue reminders to responsible groups.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  There are also established protocols for coordinating with outside agencies for emergency response, including the Melrose Fire Department and Stearns County Emergency Services.\r\n\r\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances \r\nMelrose Dairy Protiens manufactures bulk cheese and whey at the Melrose, Minnesota plant.  The NAICS code for the primary process at the facility is 311513.  Melrose Dairy Proteins has one regulated substance, ammonia, under 40 CFR 68 at the plant.  The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of ammonia stored on site is approximately 39,036 pounds.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distintive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in minute quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moistrue of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of the respiratory tract, burning of the skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of the skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquicd ammonia."
