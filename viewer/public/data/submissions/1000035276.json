Employees are trained on the emergency procedures and the procedures are updated as needed when the process or facility is modified. Changes to the emergency procedures are administered through the Management of Change process.  The overall emergency response program for Hawkville NE is coordinated with the McMullen County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Coordination includes periodic meetings to communicate Hawkville NE operations, contact information, and response activities. BHPB has 24/7 communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., McMullen County LEPC Chairman, McMullen County Sheriff and Tilden Fire Department). The LEPC would assist the Hawkville NE, as requested, to notify the public, control traffic, and facilitate response to an incident. BHPB provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated flammable substances in Hawkville NE.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAll personnel, employees, and contractors are encouraged to notify their supervisor of any changes or modifications to Hawkville NE that could result in improved safety. BHPB tracks and resolves all process hazard analysis recommendations. Plans to improve safety include evaluating the operation for any additional safety needs and considering installation of process area detection systems."

These procedures, along with training of involved personnel, form a system to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nSpecific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nHazards in the process at Hawkville NE are continually managed to ensure safe operations. The accident prevention program is applied throughout the RMP covered process at Hawkville NE and covers all individually listed flammable substances and regulated flammable mixtures. The prevention program is designed and implemented to prevent accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors. Safety features are incorporated into the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of Hawkville NE to help prevent, quickly detect, and control a release, and to reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Containment and Control\r\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and combust releases.\r\nValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\nAutomatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\r\nContainment areas to contain liquid releases.\r\nDual mechanical seals on hydrocarbon liquid pumps, where feasible.\r\nTotal plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\nPortable fire extinguishers.\r\nPersonnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\r\nPersonal protective equipment.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nBHPB has an excellent record of accident prevention. Hawkville NE is a new facility and there is no accident history.\r\n\r\n5.

These resources include safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process at the Hawkville Northeast Gas Processing Plant (Hawkville NE) and training of operations personnel and contractors.  BHPB implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  BHPB places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspections and regularly training responsible personnel.  Should a release occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release, and prevent or mitigate any off-site consequences.\r\n\r\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nHawkville NE, located in McMullen County, Texas, is owned and operated by BHPB.  Hawkville NE is a natural gas processing plant comprised of natural gas liquid recovery, natural gas liquids fractionation, and natural gas treatment and compression equipment. Produced gas and liquids are delivered to Hawkville NE from gathering systems and pipelines. The natural gas liquid recovery equipment is designed to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas. Hawkville NE produces natural gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate. The Hawkville NE equipment operates to separate, stabilize, treat (as necessary to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide), compress (gas), dehydrate (gas), store (natural gas liquids and stabilized condensate), and transfer gas, natural gas liquids, and stabilized condensate to sales. Natural gas is exported by pipeline from Hawkville NE. Natural gas liquids are"

No toxic substances are present in the process above threshold quantities. Hawkville NE complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements and Program 1 requirements of the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\n3.\tGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nImplementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards in the process ensures the safety of workers and the surrounding community. The Hawkville NE process has been designed using current equipment design codes and standards with appropriate safety controls. The process design includes control systems to maintain operating parameters, such as temperature, pressures, flow, and level within allowable limits. Written operating procedures for the process are developed, maintained, and periodically reviewed for safe operations. Personnel operating the process are trained on the operating procedures to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable safety and operability limits and steps to correct deviation from normal operating parameters. Additionally, BHPB has developed maintenance procedures to maintain equipment integrity.\r\n\r\nBHPB implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety at Hawkville NE. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure"
