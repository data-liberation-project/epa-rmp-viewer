Beaver Dam facility.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\r\n\r\nThe Kraft Heinz facility in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia. The facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system that uses a real time database to track training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups. The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week. There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Beaver Dam Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\r\n\r\nStationary Source, Regulated Substances Handles & Covered Process:\r\n\r\nKraft Heinz manufactures cream cheese and quality dips at the Beaver Dam facility. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is (311513). Beaver Dam has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 and that is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia). Ammonia is used as refrigerant to keep the process and storage areas of the plant cold, so the products stay fresh and wholesome. Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades. The quantity of ammonia at Beaver Dam is approximately 40,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\r\n\r\nThe Beaver Dam facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal"
