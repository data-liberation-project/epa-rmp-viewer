The Facility Policy\n\n\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Bulk Plant in Hale are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Hale Fire Protection District, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n\n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time would be 265,370 pounds. The facility has (1) 26,000 gallon storage tank that would be the largest tank onsite. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The facility also has (28) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and two 1,450 gallon nurse tanks for product distribution.  \n\n\n\n3. The Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\n\n    The facility"

Local responders \n\n           will be notified to control any release.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n    3/19/12"
