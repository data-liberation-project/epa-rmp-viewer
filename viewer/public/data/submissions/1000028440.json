The Enable Midstream policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. \n\n\n\nEnable Midstream operates the Waskom Rail Yard located in Harrison County, Texas. The Waskom Rail Yard is located in a remote area and is normally occupied Monday-Friday. The Waskom Rail Yard stores and transports natural gas products from the Waskom Gas Plant. The natural gas and liquids are temporarily stored onsite.  The largest volume stored in a process is in a 30,000 gallon natural gasoline railcar. \n\n\n\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon NGL railcar resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Waskom Rail Yard. The 30,000 gallon railcar has been evaluated for total rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.45 miles. Since there are public receptors within a 0.45 mile radius, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 3 Level RMP under 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.

As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Waskom Rail Yard is a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nWaskom Rail Yard was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nEnable Midstream identified one regulated flammable substance (LPG, flammable liquid mixture) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored. It was determined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture exceeded threshold quantity. The identification of this exceedance indicates that Waskom Rail Yard is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nSince the Waskom Rail Yard it had not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\n\n\nWaskom Rail Yard has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local fire department.

This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information. Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards. This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within at the facility are assigned responsibility to maintain up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limited maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems. The facility also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure "

Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Waskom Rail Yard primarily uses the HAZOP method to perform these evaluations. This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed. The PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. The Waskom Rail Yard assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule for completion dates. The also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original designed safety features, the facility periodical updates and revalidates the hazard analysis. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every five years by a PHA team.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current. Wh"

Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process. The Waskom Rail Yard provides hot work permit training to all employees. Copies of issued work permits are maintained in Operations and Maintenance for a period of one year following completion of work.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard periodically uses contractors to perform maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovations, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) are trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job, 2) follow the safety rules of the location including safe work practices, 3) advise the facility of any unique hazards presented by the contractor, and 4) notify the facility of all illnesses and injuries that occur in process areas.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Waskom Rail Yard conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
