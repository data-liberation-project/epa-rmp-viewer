The Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\nThis Facility maintains and Emergency Action Plan meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.38. Operators and facility personnel receive initial training in the provisions of this plan and refresher training periodically. In addition, this plan is shared with the local responding agencies and coordination activities occur annually. For the purposes of emergency response, this Facility is considered a non-responding facility and personnel do not conduct offensive emergency response actions. In the event of an emergency involving the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading Process, it is the policy of the facility to activate the emergency shutdown system, evacuate all onsite personnel, and contact the Augusta Fire Department and request their assistance. Representatives from the Augusta Fire Department have been briefed on the operation and were provided onsite orientation/training.\n\nThis is an RMP for a new facility and therefore has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacua"
