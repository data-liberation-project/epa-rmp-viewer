The Facility Policy - The owners, management, and employees of Orchard Fertilizer Service - Orchard are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.  The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maxiumum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi-tanker holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n          a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n          b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion is 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program -  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant"

The Emergency Response Program - The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38  We have provided state and local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety - Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
