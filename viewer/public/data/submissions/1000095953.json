Nevertheless, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Vie-Del Company Kingsburg's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vie-Del Company Kingsburg's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration and sulfur dioxide processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\nCalifornia Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n\r\nFederal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\r\nS"

Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.\u00a0 Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator (or shell of the heat exchanger), and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.\u00a0 The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure vapor ammonia is liquefied and returned to the"
