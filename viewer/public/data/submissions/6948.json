We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs, fire prevention programs and emergency response training and planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.    As specified in the EPA RMP rule, we have not had any accidents in the past five years from any covered process\n\n                                                \n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces petroleum additives using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Our plant is one of the largest and most advanced producers of high-quality blended fuel and lubricating oil additives in the world. The facility serves domestic and international markets.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur worst case scenario involves the release of one full cylinder of boron trifluoride gas in our PIB plant within ten minutes.  The cylinder contains 3,300 pounds of boron trifluoride.  The worst case scenario would occur if:\n\n1. a large leak or rupture occurred due to a material failure of the vessel or piping that was not recognized during the equipment inspection processes,\n2. any indications prior to the failure were not recognized during the routine inspection procedures,  \n3. the boron trifluoride could not be directed to the PIB wastewater scrubber column, \n4. the large leak or rupture was not detected by the process observation cameras, \n5. Operations personnel fail to respond to the leak or rupture,\n6. the boron trifluoride deluge system failed,\n7. and our emergency response system failed to respond to the incident.  \n\nWe also assume that the release occurs at night during overcast conditions (F stability) with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  Depending on the wind direction, different areas surrounding the plant might be affected.  In addition to the residents, other affected groups could include people at the Alvin Callender Naval Air Station,  Our Lady of Perpetual Help Elementary School, and Belle Chasse High School.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur alternate case scenario is a = inch hole developing in the tubing connecting th"
