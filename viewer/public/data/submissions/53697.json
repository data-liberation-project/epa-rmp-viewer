      "SummaryText": "ity has had no significant releases of sulfur dioxide between September 2003 and December 2011 that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds.  However, the facility had an RMP reportable incident that meets the above definition.  On February 23, 2011, approximately 5 pounds of gaseous sulfur dioxide was released through a transfer hose failure, resulting in the injury of one employee.   No other on site impacts occurred, no off site impacts and no environmental or property damage occurred.  Off-site responders were notified but did not respond.  The results of the internal incident investigation showed that improved/upgraded equipment and revisions to maintenance, training and operating procedures were needed.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nRipon is a responding facility with First Responder - Technician Level training (24-hr initial and 8-hr annual refresher). This training includes ammonia release emergency response and donning a respirator.  The facility is also included in the community emergency response plan. In the event of an emergency, a qualified emergency responder will take the role as Incident Commander. The Incident Commander will contact 911, Plant Manager, and Maintenance Supervisor. The plan is to incorporate personnel from the Fire Department and appropriate TWG responders.  The rest of the employees will be evacuated from the facility to a designated area.  The Fire Department and appropriate TWG responders will take over the role as Incident Commander upon arrival.  A Business Plan has been submitted to San Joaquin County, which contains the required elements discussed above and emergency response has been coordinated with the local Fire Department.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nChemical safety is an important part of The Wine Group, Inc. facility located in Ripon, California.  The Health and Safety committee as well as regulatory requirements have minimized chemical exposure risks to employees and the public through o"

For example, as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), vehicle barriers were recommended to be installed around the ammonia processes and detailed procedures were documented.  \r\n\r\nSubsequent to the submittal of the RMP Update drafted in 2004, an automatic notification system was added to the plant's programmable computer system, which automatically pages the Maintenance Supervisor (or his designate) when there is a significant system parameter deviation at the facility.  This system modification provides the quickest response to operating deviations, providing better on-time system performance.\r\n\r\nOther improvements will be made when identified and approved by Management."

      "SummaryText": "NOTES: \r\n\r\nA correction was noted on May 27, 2010 in the Executive Summary. The correction was  a typo regarding the total quantity of sulfur dioxide on site. The previous submittal was completed using the 2004 RMP*Submit and a diskette, which allowed the submitter to document one Program under section 7 for similar processes. For that submittal, one Program was completed for all three ammonia processes. For this correction, the software does not appear to allow for one Program when there are multiple processes; therefore, the answers provided for process #78244 were repeated for processes 78242 and 78243. There is no new equipment or processes associated with this submittal.\r\n\r\nAnother correction was made to the RMP in December 2011 to address the sulfur dioxide incident that occurred on February 2011 and to reflect the change in the emergency contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor).  The Supervisor will"

Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 17000 E. Highway 120 in Ripon, California, which is on the 120 Highway and approximately 5 miles east of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Systems\r\n\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of grape juice, wine, and distilled spirits.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 94,524 pounds of ammonia in its three independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  Three Chiller Groups (A, B, and C) each contain the following charge of ammonia: 23,268 pounds, 35,628 pounds, and 35,628 pounds.  The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chillers, and suction accumulator, and Glycol Circulation System and Tank Jacket Heat Exchangers/Coolers), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide glycol refrigeration.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\r\n\r\nThere is one sulfur dioxide filling station where hand-held dispensers are filled from a 1-ton cylinder.  There is one central storage location where cylinders are delivered, and The Wine Group, Inc. uses a forklift to move the cylinders to the filling station as needed.  There is a maximum of two 1-ton cylinders at the filling station and four 1-ton cylinders at the storage location.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accients.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nBetween January 2003 to December 2011, there has only been one release of a regulated substance from covered processes that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History (see Section 6 of this RMP and the incident summary below regarding the sulfur dioxide release that occurred on February 23, 2011).   Such RMP accidents would involve serious accidents with either on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  The Wine Group, Inc. (Franzia Ripon) realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and are internally investigating and correcting the causes of such releases.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Systems\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history showed that there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. However, the facility had an incident on September 2004 which caused a release of approximately 85 pounds of ammonia from the Chiller #10, in FES-B.  The facility supervisor, Marvin Pater, hosed down the area with water to control the ammonia fumes in the area and attempted to make contact with the Refrigeration Supervisor, Troy Weis and Maintenance Manager, Kevin Baskin.  The leak stopped later on that night (11:40 pm).  Investigation and repair was performed the following day, which Troy determined the valve is in good operating condition as of 9/11/2004.\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide Systems\r\n\r\nThe facil"
