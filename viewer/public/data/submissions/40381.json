The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process. Anhydrous ammonia is the RMP chemical of concern. Lampasas Mexican Foods has been at this location since 1993. The facility was operated under other ownership prior to this date. The current capacity of the system is approximately 30,000 pounds. The facility has never experienced a significant incident.\n\n\tThe refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Safety of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration. Technicians are qualified in accordance with the requirements of the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA). Lampasas Mexican Foods and the refrigeration staff are all current members of RETA.\n\n\tThe system is inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day. Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 4 hours. System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\tThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides. In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down. The system can\u00bft be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.\n\n\tIn addition to operational training, designated tech"

A minimum of two (2) Incident Commanders is onsite at all times. Refrigeration Technicians and other staff members are also trained to respond to accidental releases of ammonia from the system. Lampasas Mexican Foods has equipment and supplies on-hand to permit trained employees to aggressively locate and control a release, should it occur. The facility conducts a full incident response drill and exercise every year.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management Program in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1910.119). This plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility\u00bfs plan.\n\n\tThe EPA requires the facility to model the potential offsite impact from a worst-case release of ammonia and an alternate release scenario. The worst-case release is based on a release from the high-pressure liquid receiver located outside the Engine Room. This could potentially release approximately 15,000 pounds of ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is a gas at normal temperature and pressure. It may by liquefied by pressure in parts of the system. The liquid will quickly vaporize back to a gas when exposed to the atmosphere. The gas is lighter than air and rises quickly into the atmosphere with little environmental impact. Ammonia has an irritating effect on inhalation at high concentrations. Ammonia is highly water-soluble. A gas cloud can be mitigated effectively with water spray. \nLampasas Mexican Foods can provide water spray. The Lampasas Fire Department can provide additional support.\n\n\tThe alternate release scenario involves a release from a relief valve. This type of incident could create a gas rele"
