These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In complying, we promote overall facility, employee and public safety.  Smithfield's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness or death and to avoid the potential for property and environmental impact.  \n\nSmithfield's safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage handling or the on-site movement of chemicals.  Any groups of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.   Smithfield's has a policy and commitment to employee safety and it is expressed in all programs and training. \n\nSmithfield's safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on rules, procedures, and best practices which govern processes, activities, and/or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and revised as necessary; all information is communicated to employees of Smithfield through training and documentation.  The safety equipment used for HAZ-MAT purposes is inspected monthly and records are retained in the Refrigeration Supervisors "
