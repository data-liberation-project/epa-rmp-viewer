Our bulk tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons when filled to 85% capacity (max allowed by law, figured at 5.14 pounds per gallon).  We also have up to 10-1,000 gallon nurse tanks on site that would have a total of 43,690 pounds capacity.  This would give a total of 122,332 pounds total capacity.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and transferred for use as a crop production nutrient.

In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet the current underwriting guidelines of Farmland Insurance and undergo annual loss control surveys based on both physical property and safety/operational procedures.  NOTE:  The state of Kansas has not yet adopted the latest version of the ANSI standard.  When the Department of Agriculture adopts the latest version we will budget the needed time and funds to insure that all facilities meet the new guidelines.  \n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location.

We rotate our employees on a three-year basis and send them to NH3 schools that we feel provide excellent training.

We have implemented Standard Operating Procedures that are written down for the benefit of our new employees, as well as Standard Maintenance Procedures.  \n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan, which OSHA requires. As required by 29CFR1910.120(P)(8) the Emergency Response Plan is not needed.  Our employees are trained to evacuate the area should an emergency release occur.  Employees are trained on basic first aid for victims, where to evacuate too, and how to notify first responders.   \n\nWe report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inventories and locations as required by The Community Right-to-Know\" rules and regulations.  \n\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process at our firm.  We are dedicated to safely serving our customers and protecting the employees that work for us.  Training, equipment and maintenance are of the highest quality and design.  We order all parts from an industry specialist to insure that they are approved parts for the process.  At this time there are no specific upgrades planned.  We are proud of our efforts and proud to serve the communities in which we operate."
