      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction \n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Rialto Wastewater Treatment Plant (Rialto WTP) use chemicals, too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment and we use sulfur dioxide to remove excess chlorine in a final polishing stage of treatment.  Storing large qualities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using these chemicals as seriously as we take protecting water quality through the wastewater treatment.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure safety, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Rialto Department of Public Works and Rialto WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  These regulations require facilities storing large quantities of certain chemicals like chlorine and sulfur dioxide to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Rialto WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers and a dechlorination system that use"

This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal response team policies and procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the environment. The Rialto WTP has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental.  In over 40 years of operation, the Rialto WTP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Rialto WTP, operating since 1956, is located at 501 East Santa Ana Avenue in the City of Bloomington in San Bernardino County, California.  The plant is located approximately one mile south of the San Bernardino Freeway and one-half mile east of Riverside Avenue.  Wastewater from the City of Rialto Department of Public Works service area is treated at the Rialto WTP and highly treated, disinfected water produced is discharged into the Rialto Channel.  This wastewater treatment includes preliminary treatment, flow equalization, primary and secondary treatment, coagulation/filtration, and chlorination and dechlorination before final discharge or reclamation use.  The Rialto WTP handles wastewater flows up to 8 million gallons per day (MGD), with an average flow of between 5.8 to 6.4 MGD.\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine and sulfur dioxide; both regulated toxic substances under RMP and CalARP regulations.  Chlorine is stored in a 7,000 gallon steel bulk storage tank, which holds a maximum of 34 tons.  Sulfur dioxide is stored in a 7,000 gallon steel bulk storage tank, which holds a maximum of 31.5 tons.  Both liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide are brought to the plant by truck and transferred to the bulk storage tanks.  Either liquid or gaseous chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be withdrawn from the tanks.  Facilities storing more than 2,500 lbs of chlorine and 5,000 lbs of sulfur dioxide "

The leak detectors are self-contained, electrically- operated devices designed to detect 0.5 ppm by volume of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the air.  If a leak occurs, a level of 0.5 ppm will turn on a red warning light on top of the building and will sound an audible alarm.   The detector also will send a signal to the central computer system that activates an alarm on the annunciator board in the control building and also lights a panel alarm on the detector unit itself in the equipment room.  Other alarms include excess flow alarms and evaporator malfunction alarms.  These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine and sulfur dioxide central and local control panels.\n\nExpansion chambers, rupture discs, and pressure relief valves are located throughout the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes to protect against excess pressure.  All processes related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment. \n\nBoth the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage tanks are equipped with a safety relief valve and excess flow valves for liquid.  The safety relief device in the center of the tank manway dome is equivalent to a pressure relief valve in the event excess pressure builds up in the storage tank.  The excess flow valves are ball-check type valves located directly beneath the angle valves for both liquid and gas chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  These excess flow valves are designed to close automatically against the flow of liquid or gaseous chemicals if an angle valve is broken off or a major piping leak occurs downstream of the storage tank.  \n\nThe controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide evaporators are equipped with two protection devices.  One device monitors"

The other alarm will engage should the temperature of the water be too high or low for proper evaporation of the sulfur dioxide gas.  Another alarm on the evaporator discharge piping monitors gas pressure and is equipped with rupture disc and pressure switch to alert operations personnel of a problem either with the evaporator or the downstream valving or equipment. \n\nEmergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the chemical building.  Emergency air packs are available near the chemical process rooms, and fire extinguishers are available at the Chemical Feed Room.  \n\nThe single road entry to Rialto WTP is controlled at Santa Ana Avenue by a gate.  The chemical building remains locked and only a limited number of Rialto WTP staff have keys. The plant is staffed during the day, year round, and alarms notify on-call staff during off-hours of any problems or situations that require followup investigation.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst-case scenario requires that that single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for off-site impacts from either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The rupture of both the chlorine tank and a sulfur dioxide tank were modeled for the worst-case release scenario, but the resulting affected area was greater under the chlorine release scenario. Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce off-site impacts. An alternative release scenario is required for both substances. \n\nThe worst case scenario for Rialto WTP is the rupture of the chlorine bulk storage tank, resulting in a release of 68,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration.  Since the chlorine storage tank is located inside a building, EPA's building mitigation factors"

      "SummaryText": " were considered for estimating the release rates for performing air dispersion modeling for the worst-case release scenario.  The release rate of chlorine, considering the EPA mitigation factor will, accordingly, be 3,740 pounds per minute (lbs./min).  In practice this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant.\nThe released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 3.0.3) model.  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency respond planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP was 3 ppm.  In addition all required EPA-model input parameters where included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (115 degree F), and average humidity (64 percent).  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, but still is highly unlikely.  In accordance with regulations guiding this report, alternative release scenarios were evaluated for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Unlike the worst-case release scenario, active controls can be considered in analyzing the alternative release scenario.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe scenarios selected for the Rialto WTP chlorination and dechlorination systems involve the release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide vapor from a leak in a flange or valve, resulting from an operator error during tank isolation for hydrostatic testing.

The chemical process buildings contain chlorine  and sulfur dioxide leak detection equipment, and it is assumed that the duration of the leak is approximately ten minutes.\n\nUnder this scenario, the amount of chlorine and sulfur dioxide released were calculated to be 0.25 and 0.15 lb/min, respectively. The same modeling approach was used as for the worst case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more common conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.3 meters per second, average air temperature of 63 degrees F, and average humidity of 51 percent.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide alternative release scenarios indicate that these scenarios have an offsite, but very limited, impact.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nRialto WTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide; and the presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors and alarms.\n\nRialto WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n7 Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n7 Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n7 A process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review\n7 Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with operations and maintenance staff participation\n7 High level of training of operators and maintenance staff\n7 Implementation of an incident investi"
