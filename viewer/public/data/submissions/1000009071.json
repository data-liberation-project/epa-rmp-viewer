The released quantity is 100 % of the maximum capacity of the source.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 15 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrocyanic Acid involves a release from Hydrocyanic Acid Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 5487 lb. of Hydrocyanic Acid.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/L of Hydrocyanic Acid is 1.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) involves a release from the Formaldehyde Storage System.  The scenario involves the release of 19180 lb. of 44.5 % Formaldehyde solution.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1918 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by  an emergency shutdown system and water monitor.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the liquid release and vapor suppression.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (44.5 % solution) is 0.43 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System.
