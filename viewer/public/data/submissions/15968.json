At a minimum, DWTP employees will: (1) participate in the development and implementation of the site specific Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP programs; (2) participate in conducting the chlorine and ammonia process hazard analysis; (3) be trained annually on the PSM and RMP programs and be made aware of any interim changes to the program or process systems; (4) work with management to develop additional programs or procedures relative to chlorine and ammonia process safety; and, (5) participate in periodic audits of the chemical processes and the PSM Program. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPreventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are reviewed and revised, as necessary, to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe DWTP has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsibility for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Planning Committees.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe DWTP utilizes chlorine and ammonia for disinfection of treated water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\nChemical   "

A dense gas dispersion model (RMP*COMP) was used to determine endpoint distances for both scenarios.  The model input parameters and assumptions fulfilled 40 CFR Part 68 requirements and are summarized in the following table\n\nRMP*COMP Input Parameters\nParameter        Worst-Case Scenario (CL2)    Alternative Scenario (CL2)    Alternative Scenario (NH3)\nEnd Point Concentration (mg/l)  0.0087                          0.0087                                      0.140\nWindspeed (m/s)                      1.5                                      3                                              3\nAtmospheric Stability Class         F                                      D                                              D\nTemperature (0 F)                      77                                    77                                             77\nTerrain                                    Rural                                Rural                                        Rural\nRelease Rate (lbs/min)            200                                    90                                           228\nDuration (min)                            10                                    10                                             10\n\nThe results of the air dispersion model are summarized in the table along with estimated populations within the impact areas.

Stanley Draper Lake is a sporting and recreational area.  The properties surrounding the DWTP include sensitive environmental receptors such as wilderness and wetland areas. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe DWTP has acquired knowledge regarding process safety and hazard assessment.  Under Program 3, DWTP has used this information to implement policies and procedures related to operations, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigations, compliance audits, management of change, pre-start review, contractors, employee participation, and hot work permits in order to create a safe workplace.\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe completion of the Hazard Assessment resulted in the recognition of preventive steps in order to eliminate or minimize the possibility for accidental releases and employee exposure to chemical risk.\n\nProcess Safety Management Program\n\nDWTP has compiled a Process Safety Management program to minimize releases.  This Program includes safety information related to the covered chemicals, hazard review, operating and maintenance schedules, training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years there have been two accidental releases reported at the DWTP.  The first release occurred on June 27, 1994 at 12:30 A.M.  Approximately five pounds of chlorine was released and one emloyee was treated for chlorine inhalation.  This incident did not result in an offsite impact and no offsite responders were called.\n\nThe second release occurred on September 22, 1994 at 03:55.  Approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine was release"
