Key personnel are notified by a system of pagers and alarms. Once this notification system is activated, a series of emergency plans follow. For example, in the event of a fire, the Emergency Response Team will respond and an on-site Chain of Command communication system is implemented. The Emergency Response Team is trained to deal with chemical releases and emergencies. Coordinated drills with the Avon Lake Fire Department and the Lorain County Emergency Planning Committee are conducted to insure good communication and operational effectiveness. These groups are also trained and available to assist with emergency situations.\n\nVII. Planned Safety Improvements\nLubrizol Avon Lake Plant continues to evaluate and identify process hazards. As hazards are identified, corrective action plans are developed and implemented.  We are evaluating changing from anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia.  If successful, this use of an inherently safer material would drop the plant below the trigger levels for RMP.\n\nVI.

Health, Safety and Environmental Policies\nThe Lubrizol Avon Lake Plant is governed by a commitment to excellence as it pertains to Health, Safety and Environmental performance. This is exemplified by the following excerpts from Lubrizol\u00c2\u00bfs Global Mission:\n\nExcel in Health, Safety & Environmental Performance\n\nTo achieve this we:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHold every executive, manager, supervisor and employee directly accountable for HSE performance\n\u00c2\u00bf\tRigorously comply with all relevant laws and regulations\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImplement ACC\u00c2\u00bfs Responsible Care\u00c2\u00ae Management System as a global standard\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSet periodic goals and report progress\n\u00c2\u00bf\tRecognize and reward HSE performance excellence\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSeek and implement industry best practices\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIdentify and mitigate HSE risks associated with our products and operations\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIncorporate HSE issues in the development of all new products and processes and in the manufacture, sale, distribution, use and disposal of products\n\u00c2\u00bf\tDialog with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders on the safe and environmentally responsible use of products and on the HSE aspects of  operations\n\u00c2\u00bf\tUse periodic third-party assessments of our HSE programs and performance\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIncorporate the principles of sustainable development in strategic planning\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPrioritize resources to ensure continuous improvement\n\nII. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Lubrizol Avon Lake Ohio Plant is located at 550 Moore Road in Avon Lake, Ohio. At this location the toxic chemical present that is in excess of the applicable regulatory threshold quantity is: Anhydrous ammonia. There are no RMP flammable chemicals present at this location in excess of the applicable regulatory threshold quantity.\n\nIn February 2009 we closed an acrylic latex process.  A storage tank of Acrylonitrile associated with this process was emptied and decommissioned.  Thus Acrylonitrile was removed from our RMP regulated"

Release Scenario\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios, including a discussion of administrative and mitigative measures used to minimize the affects of the release are described below.\nOne worst case release scenario is provided for the Plant, i.e., the scenario with the farthest endpoint, and an alternative release scenario is provided.  The distinguishing differences between the two types of scenarios are: (1) the USEPA specifically defines the parameters of the worst case releases scenario and (2) only the alternative release scenario takes into account the accident/release prevention measures that are in-place to prevent and mitigate any release.\n\nIV. Accident and Release Prevention Programs\nThe Lubrizol Avon Lake Plant has several programs in place, which are specifically focused on preventing the accidental release of chemicals. These programs are consistent with Plant and Lubrizol policies and with the Occupational Safety and Health Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) for highly hazardous chemicals.\nThese programs are:\n1. Employee Participation - Employees regularly participate in activities directed toward aspects of Plant Safety, e.g., Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change Procedures, and monthly safety meetings.\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Various Process Hazard Analysis Techniques are performed to identify and analyze the potential process hazards associated with handling hazardous chemicals. Corrective Action plans are then formed and implemented.\n3. Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to insure their safe operation. These procedures are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary.\n4. Employee Training - Training programs have been developed and implemented to insure all employees fully understand the hazards of the chemicals in use and the required safe handling procedures. The Plant has established an Operation Certification program to train, tes"

For New Processes - Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are conducted to insure a safe transition into the normal operating mode.\n7. A Mechanical Integrity program is in place to insure the integrity of process equipment. Elements include the following:\n- identification and categorization of equipment and instrumentation\n- inspections and tests\n- establishment of prescribed inspection frequencies\n- development and application of maintenance procedures\n- training of maintenance personnel\n- documentation of test and inspection results\n- documentation of manufacturer's maintenance recommendations\n8. A Hot Work Permit System is in place to manage welding, cutting or brazing of equipment in process areas to prevent fire or explosions.\n9. A Management of Change System has been implemented to properly manage changes involving processes, chemicals, technology, equipment or facilities.\n10. In the event of any Chemical Release or Near Miss an Incident Investigation or Board of Review is conducted by a team of experienced individuals familiar with the process. All recommendations are documented and tracked through completion.\n11. A highly trained, on shift, Emergency Response Team is prepared to respond to chemical release events.\n12. Compliance Audits are performed to review all relevant documentation, verify process safety information and inspect the physical facilities.\nV. Five Year Accident History Involving RMP Chemicals\nDuring the past five years, the Lubrizol Avon Lake Plant has had no chemical releases/accidents involving anhydrous ammonia or acrylonitrile which resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nVI.
