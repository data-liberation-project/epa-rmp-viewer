THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n   THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CHANDLER COOP ARE \nCOMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF PROPANE.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n   THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF PROPANE FOR SALES AND DELIVERY.\n\n  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE GAS STORED WOULD BE 190,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 26,000\nGALLON TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 26,000\nGALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (94,000 POUNDS) RESULTING IN A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE.  ACCORDING TO THE EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS .38 MILES.\n\nB.  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE FAILURE OF ONE 26,000\nGALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO 85 PERCENT CAPACITY (94,000 POUNDS) RESULTING TWO THIRDS OF A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVERPRESSURE.  ACCORDING TO THE EPA LOOKUP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS (.67 x .38 MILES = .25 MILES) .25 MILES.     \n\n4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    FOR PROPANE, THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED NFPA-58 RULES.\n\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY; NOR TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DA"
