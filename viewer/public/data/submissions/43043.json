As it is Camp Frio, Inc.\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed in 1997 to the applicable Uniform Building Code/Uniform Mechanical Code.  Personnel at Camp Frio Cold Storage monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All operations, service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine operations, service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Camp Frio, Inc.\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Camp Frio Cold Storage and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nCamp Frio, Inc. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and CalARP regulations.  At least every three years, Camp Frio, Inc. audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nCamp Frio, Inc. owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 31792 Merced Avenue.  Shafter is the closest city to the Camp Frio Cold Storage facility.  The rural plant was constructed in 1997 utilizing all new equipment at the time of construction.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provide"

The refrigeration system consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three compressors, an evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, and several flooded evaporators.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be \u00bfpumped down\u00bf to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 15,390 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 defines the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Camp Frio, Inc. to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00bf Written operating procedures will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\n\n\u00bf If employees are involved in operating the ammonia system, they will receive initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n\u00bf Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n\u00bf A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to th"

The Cold Storage Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Camp Frio Cold Storage facility has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCamp Frio, Inc. has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Camp Frio Cold Storage employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders. \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nCamp Frio, Inc. relies on the expertise of qualified amm"
