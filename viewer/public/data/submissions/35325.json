Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThis facility handles Liquefied Petroleum Gases (propane, isobutane and normal butane).  These are flammable gases, so it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent human exposure and reduce health threats to our workers and the nearby community.  Aeropres Corporation will strictly adhere to all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  \n\nSafety depends on:\n(a) The manner in which we handle these products;\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility;\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures, and\n(d) Employee training.\n\nOur emergency response program details employee responsibilities, actions and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and the LEPC to notify potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to ship Liquefied Petroleum Gases to our customers via truck and rail.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Stops:\nThis facility complies with all Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 and ASME codes and regulations.  All employees are thoroughly trained on the characteristics and handling of propane.\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History:\nThere have  been no accidents at this facility.\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program:\nA detailed emergency response program has been developed and sent to the Webster Parish LEPC.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThere are no plans for changes at this time."
