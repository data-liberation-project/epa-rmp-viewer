For example, municipal and industrial water treatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for water disinfectants and other treatment products, equipment and expertise.\n\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with branches that meet local needs in six neighboring states.  The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distribute products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.\n  \nHawkins subsidiary, the Hawkins Water Treatment Group,  has prepared and filed a Risk Management Plan for its St. Paul facility, also known as Red Rock, where its primary activity is to receive products such as chlorine from manufacturers and to repackage those products into portions appropriate for individual customer facilities.  Because of its historical reputation for responsiveness, customers also turn to staff at this facility for customized services such as manufacturing household bleach and blending products for the treatment of potable water.\n\nThe Risk Management Plan that Hawkins staff has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool; it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others.   Risk Management Plans are developed by facilities that have sufficient quantities of any of 140 hazardous materials on site; at this facility, we handle four(4) of those materials.\n\nKey Products\nThe products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility are:\n* Chlorine:  Chlorine and bleach (sodium hypochlorite) are well known and trusted disinfectants for drinking water, waste water, food processing equipment, swimming pools, etc.\n* Sulfur dioxide: Used to make paper and by water treatment facilities to purify water.\n* Anhydrous Ammonia: Used in refrigeration systems\n* Aqua Ammonia: Used for NOx emission control and potable wate"

Some of these products pose risks, which is why all Hawkins employees share a commitment to safety.  Our safety policy states:  \"Hawkins, Inc. recognizes its obligation to provide all employees with a safe and healthful workplace and to ensure that operations do not impact neighbors. The Company has provided, and will continue to provide, the human, physical and financial resources necessary to meet this objective.  We expect all employees of the Company to use these resources to make our operations as safe and healthful as is humanly possible.\"\n\nPlanning for accidents, such as that done through RMP, helps to ensure that they never happen.  In fact, our Red Rock facility has been built to specifically minimize any environmental impact an accident may have.   Hawkins has nearly 60 years of experience in handling chlorine and is a leader in national efforts to ensure safe handling of chemicals.\n\nReality is, however, that accidents can happen.  That's why we will continue to update mechanical safeguards and invest heavily in training for our employees and our customers.\n\nIn addition to our internal efforts, safety and emergency response planning also is coordinated with local and national officials, including the St. Paul Fire Department, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and U.S. Coast Guard.  Hawkins also must regularly meet requirements in industrial wastewater, national pollutant discharge (NPDS) and other permits, and is an active member of the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors."
