      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(40 CFR 68.155)\r\n\r\nAgrium US Inc owns and operates the Kennewick Fertilizer Operations (KFO) located in semi-rural Benton County.  KFO consists of three adjacent, but not contiguous, operating areas - the Kennewick Area, Hedges Area, and Finley Area.  The Hedges Area is currently on standby and all chemical inventories have been removed.  KFO facilities are located on the west bank of the Columbia River with open fields, industrial neighbors, and rural residences in the general area.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is brought into KFO by railcar and stored in atmospheric storage tanks, pressurized spheres, or cylindrical tanks in both the Kennewick Area and Finley Area.  In the Finley Area anhydrous ammonia is stored for resale, is transferred via pipeline for processing into nitric acid in the Kennewick Area, and is mixed with water to make aqua ammonia.  \r\n\r\nIn the Kennewick Area anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid and is also mixed with nitric acid in a process vessel called a neutralizer to produce liquid 83% ammonium nitrate (AN-83).  AN-83 is primarily an intermediate stream that is processed into liquid fertilizer solutions but is also sold as a product.  Aqua ammonia is delivered to the Kennewick Area for use in pH adjustment in the production of UAN-32 liquid fertilizer solution.  \r\n\r\nKFO is a wholesaler, and sales of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are typically in tanker truck load quantities picked up by regional retail customers at the facilities.   \r\n\r\n1.  KFO accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nKFO has management policy statements at the Corporate and plant management level endorsing the practice of all necessary measures to maintain safe operations.  Operating personnel are authorized to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to responds to an emergency.  KFO has an emergency response plan with detailed response procedures.\r\n\r\nKFO also has a series of Administrative Procedures (APs"

      "SummaryText": "), Safe Work Practices (SWPs), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide detailed instructions for safely conducting operational and maintenance tasks and activities.  All of the above documents, in their latest version, are available to all employees electronically on the KFO Intranet.  Any procedure can be printed to be used as a guide for a specific task.\r\n\r\n2.  KFO regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nBoth the Kennewick Area and Finley Area currently handle anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) and aqua ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7).\r\n\r\n3.  KFO accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe KFO Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Administrative Procedures (APs), Safe Work Practices (SWPs), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) implemented at the facility for anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes & systems, equipment, and related activities and the general loss control program represent the main active commitments of our facility to our accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n4.  KFO five-year accident history\t2015-2019\r\n\r\nThe RMP requires a five-year history of all releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nKFO Finley Area had an Ammonia release on February 28, 2019 and 1500 lbs was released. there were no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5.  KFO emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained annually on emergency response and spill response procedures and this training is supported by information in the Kennewick Emergency Manual (KEM).  KFO has designated personnel as defined by the Incident Command System (ICS) to respond to emergencies.  The management structure based on the ICS is adaptable to incidents of any sc"

The plant designated emergency responders are trained to take emergency action in response to hazardous material incidents to stop, contain, and control releases.  If warranted, outside emergency services shall be called to provide assistance, and if needed, the services of an outside response contractor will be used.\r\n\r\nThe Spill & Release Reporting Guide outlines the reporting procedures in the event of a chemical release to the air, ground, ground waters, or to the Columbia River from KFO.  This guide is located on the KFO facility Intranet and is accessible by all KFO employees through any of the facilities computer stations.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis recommendations are risk ranked and implemented according to risk priority, and compliance audit findings are tracked until corrective actions have been implemented.  These planned and continuous improvements contribute to the prevention and mitigation of accidental release of regulated substances."
