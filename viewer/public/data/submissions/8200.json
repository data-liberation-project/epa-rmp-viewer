      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Peace River / Manasota Regional Water Supply Authority (Authority) operates a water treatment plant located in the southwestern part of DeSoto County (a relatively unpopulated area). The function of this plant is to provide potable water to Authority customers for domestic, commercial and fire protection purposes.\nChlorine gas, a hazardous and toxic chemical, is used for disinfection because it provides the best balance of disinfection ability, ease of use, relatively low cost, and residual disinfecting power for the water treated and public served. Typically, the Authority will store up to 20,000 pounds of chlorine at the water treatment plant for current and future use. The Authority has provided disinfection with chlorine for the public water system for many years.\nChlorine is stored in a semi-enclosed area and used in a sealed building at the water plant. The building and storage areas are protected by a gas detection system and are secured against intrusion. A security fence surrounds the entire plant site and an individual fence surrounds the chlorine facility. Any plant operation involving the use of chlorine is performed by personnel specifically trained in the use and handling of chlorine and chlorine containers.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe Authority's overall policy with respect to chlorine gas is based around the need for conscientious storage, handling, and use of the chemical. The Authority has a comprehensive program of procedures related to chlorine designed to minimize the likelihood of exposure to employees as well as nearby residents and the environment. Procedures in place for the Water Treatment Plant mandate the use of a \"team\" concept (minimum of two people) observed by the facility supervisors to insure that safety comes first.\nThe procedures are based, in part, on the most stringent requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.\nEmergency response, in the event of a re"

DeSoto County Fire Rescue and the DeSoto County Sheriff's Office serve as the initial responder in the case of all emergency calls from the water plant. In addition, mutual aid agreements are in place with the Charlotte County Fire and Rescue Department to provide services, should they become necessary. The response team will perform coordination of response, public communication, recovery and cleanup activities.\n\nCHEMICAL RELEASE SCENARIOS:\nAs part of the procedure to prepare this Risk Management Plan (RMP), the Authority has undertaken a rigorous review of the required worst-case and alternate release scenarios for the chlorine at the water plant. These scenarios are reviewed to determine the offsite impact, if any, of such a release.\nThe \"worst-case\" scenario involves the loss of all the contents of a one-ton container of chlorine, which is the largest single storage unit held by the Authority. Under regulatory requirements, this scenario assumes that the worst possible combination of release rate, weather conditions, and release location occur. If a release were to occur in this \"worst-case\" mode, an area outside the plant site would be affected.\nThe Authority believes that the risk associated with such a scenario is negligible, since the conditions leading to this type of release are considered to be extremely rare. The Authority, as part of its Accident Prevention Program, requires that the persons delivering chlorine to the water plant be trained in the safe handling of chlorine containers. The chlorine producers, through their Chlorine Institute, have developed packaging, inspection, and transportation standards designed to maximize the safe handling of chlorine in public areas.\nThe chlorine facility is a vacuum operated system, with pressures above atmospheric present only in the storage containers. The facility is equipped with audible a"

      "SummaryText": "nd visual alarms in the event of a leak or abnormal operating conditions.The most likely form of release involves a container leak as a result of a severely corroded container or a faulty supply valve. The Chlorine Institute standards provide protection against corroded containers and it is the Authority's policy to reject any container exhibiting traits of a defective valve. The procedures mandate that the connection of chlorine containers to the disinfection system be performed only by personnel trained in proper handling and use of chlorine. \nThe Authority considered one alternate release scenario, which is included in this RMP. The release scenario assumes that a faulty valve or improper handling leads to a release lasting approximately 45 minutes with normally encountered atmospheric conditions. In this case, the alarms will activate, but the open nature of the storage area would lead to a gas release, leading to a small area of offsite impact.\n\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nOver the last five years, the water treatment plant has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nAs mentioned earlier, the Authority has implemented a strict level of safety procedures and policies, that have been practiced for years before the state and federal rules were enacted. Specifically, the Authority has implemented a program designed to minimize the likelihood, and potential impact, of accidental releases. Specific elements of the program include regular process hazard analysis, training, contractor safety programs, regular review and updating of operating procedures, maintenance programs to enhance mechanical integrity, self-administered compliance reviews, and management of change.\nEach of the individual elements is supported by an organization framework in which key employees are given responsibility for RMP elements. This management program includes mandatory review and documentation procedures to ensure future safety as the pla"
