      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nFlora Food Sourcing US, Inc (Flora) is located at 27080 W. 159th Street, in New Century, Kansas. The facility employs two independent refrigeration systems that contain anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed System; the Conventional system has a maximum inventory of approximately 23,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and the Super-critical Melt Micronization (ScMM) system, installed in 2014 with a facility expansion, has a maximum inventory of approximately 34,400 pounds. The systems consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment cycle ammonia through various states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing and storage of margarine. Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors. The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors and on the roof of the plant. The relief systems for each of the refrigeration units are also located on the roof. The Conventional ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high-pressure side and a low pressure side. The margarine processing units (MPUs) operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly freeze product on swept surface heat exchangers. Ammonia suction from the MPUs, at about 2 psig, passes through the low accumulator before entering the booster compressors. Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side accumulators and returned as high-pressure liquid for the system. The booster discharge passes through an intercooler before entering the high side compressors. The high side compressor draws suction from the intercooler/high side suction accumulator at about 25 psig (booster discharge). This accumulator receives suction from various cooler units. Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and returned to the system. The major discharge f"

      "SummaryText": "rom the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to seven condensing towers. A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and for transferring liquid. A condensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver where it is fed to the low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air handlers. The liquid is pre-cooled in the intercooler vessel before entering the cooler units and a portion of the MPUs. The ScMM ammonia refrigeration system consists of seven (7) screw compressors that supply high side pressure to the system. The HPL travels to the thermosyphon and the high-pressure receiver where the liquid is routed to plate & frame oil coolers integrated with the compressors. The HPL then flows to three surge tanks. Surge tanks 1 and 2 are used to supply the coolant for the ice water chillers, cooling water to 33\u00b0F. Surge tank 3 supplies refrigerant to two plate & frame heat exchangers which are designed to cool production water to 43\u00b0F. The coolant returns to the surge tanks in vapor phase and becomes the suction for the compressors. Ancillary equipment for this system includes three oil pots that accompany each surge tank. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\nWe are a non-responding facility.  However, we coordinate with the local fire department on an annual basis our internal Emergency Action Plan and ensure we are still currently included in the community emergency response program.  Our Emergency Action Plan provides procedures for our employees to conduct in the event of an uncontrolled release or any other RMP reportable incident.\nWe do our best to prevent accidental releases.  We have well trained staff, established SOP\u0092s, and active and passive mitigation measures that act as additional fail-safe design. The offsite consequence analysis was determined utilizing the online browser based RMP*Comp, and the 2010 U.S. Census population data and offsite public and environmental receptor data are based upon in"
