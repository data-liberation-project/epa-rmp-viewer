New processes are not frequently employed by the facility, so routine reviews of the standard procedures are conducted and certified as being unchanged.  Periodic visits by emergency responders (i.e. Fire Department) are conducted to keep them continually aware of the operations conducted at the facility.  \nA review of our five-year accident history was conducted to find that no incident or accidents lead to off-site endpoints beyond the facility boundaries.  Regardless, we have updated our accident investigation process to represent best practice methods, and have updated our site contingency plan and emergency action plan to include improved material information --- including health and safety data, product reactivity information, and PPE and spill response information critical to increasing the knowledge base on the chemicals we work with.\nImprovements have been made to the mechanical integrity program to include inspection and/or testing of equipment such as holding tanks, valves, piping, pumps, containment, etc.  Replacement in kind has been undertaken to maintain a level of spare parts for immediate repair and/or replacement of equipment that is crucial to the safe and productive operation of our business.  \nThe EHS manager is designated as the person with overall responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the Risk Management Plan; overseeing the development; implementation and integration of the Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management on behalf of Acid Products Company, Inc. and Prairie Packaging, LLC. \nThe Plant Managers of each facility have direct responsibility of reviewing, improving and directing the staff in implementation."

      "SummaryText": "Acid Products Company Inc. (APCO) has been doing business in Chicago, IL since 1916, and was incorporated in 1956.  APCO has a long history of serving many industry segments with chemical products and blends used in the plating, finishing, formulating and maintenance industries - to name a few.  \n\nAPCO is a member in good standing of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (adhering to the Responsible Distribution Code of Conduct), and are certified as an International Standards Organization (ISO).\nThe management of APCO has strived to instill in its workforce a work ethic that ensures the protection of its workers, the public, our property and the environment.  We take our commitment to safety and the Responsible Distribution Code of Conduct very seriously.\n\n\nUnder RMP, APCO handles two products --- Formaldehyde 37-11 and Hydrofluoric Acid 70%.  Prior RMP management had submitted a RMP discussing the utilization of tanks for both products; however, the Hydrofluoric Acid is no longer received or held in a tank.  The demand from our customer base no longer warranted the bringing in of bulk HF material, and the economics became such that there was no advantage to buying in bulk.  Thus, the tank used for HF 70% was emptied, triple rinsed, closed and sealed (with a numbered seal documenting closing of the tank) to ensure It will not be used.  \n\nFormaldehyde 37-11 product is brought in by tank truck, and off-loaded into a bulk storage tank.  The product is then transferred to drums and totes for transfer to customers.  \nAPCO has all necessary elements applicable to prevent accidental releases and has in place emergency response procedures in the event of an unintentional release of any product handled at the facility.  Our Operation Standards Manual contains procedures outlining proper unloading, transfer, and packaging procedures for the products in question.  In addition, we have Management of Change, Pre-Startup, and Process Hazard Analysis protocols for a"
