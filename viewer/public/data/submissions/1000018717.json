Compliance with EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68), Federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) is also be maintained. This plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system at Columbus Foods - 493 Forbes Boulevard, South San Francisco, California.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the facility requirements and defines design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  Columbus Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with the CalARP rules as a result of meeting other regulatory program requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the CalARP requirements, that information is contained in this document.  Note:  Columbus has rewritten and improved the company's CalARP/RMP/PSM programs.  All documentation prior to this effort is on-hand and available; all new programs/policies implemented as a result of this effort are initiated and are being utilized moving forward.\n\n \n\n1.1.   Commitment to Safety\n\n \n\nColumbus Foods is committed to providing all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining Zero Accident Tolerance through communication, information, and training.  We are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means nec"

      "SummaryText": "fety of its systems\n\n1.2.2.              Regulatory program implementation will facilitate follow-up items from the following activities: Process Hazard Analyses, Seismic Studies, Incident Investigations, Operating Procedure Reviews, and Compliance Audits.  Columbus is committed to implementing the recommendations from these activities as a way of always improving safety.  \n\n1.2.3.               In addition, more dramatic system changes such as alternate refrigerants (i.e.: expanded use of glycol), better confinement of ammonia charge, advanced detection and alarming, and public notification are being investigated.  It is likely that one or many of these potential changes will be implemented to further enhance system safety.\n\n \n\n\n1.3.        Columbus Foods Description\n\n \n\n1.3.1.                Columbus Foods is located at 493 Forbes Boulevard, South San Francisco, California. The facility is a salame and deli meat processing facility that receives raw materials from suppliers. The raw product is processed on site to make final and work in process products for distribution to retailers or further packaging. \n\n \n\n1.3.2.                Anhydrous ammonia, which is regulated under CalARP, is utilized at Columbus Foods in the facility's ammonia refrigeration systems. Approximately 8,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized for refrigeration in two (2) separate ammonia processes.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators, condensers, compressors and miscellaneous refrigeration equipment located throughout the two refrigeration systems.  System 1 is a single stage system, critical charged system.  This system has three reciprocating compressors, one condenser, one controlled pressure receiver, one pumped recirculator with two pumps that supply medium temperature recirculated liquid to 19 evaporators.  The medium temperature recirculated suction header is routed to the pumped recirculator, and the high stage suction is maintained by the compressors"

      "SummaryText": ".  System 2 is a single stage system.  This system has three reciprocating compressors, one condenser, one high pressure receiver, and one suction accumulator.  The high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is supplied via pressure differential to the suction accumulator from where the liquid flows by gravity to plate and frame chillers.  Liquid refrigerant supplied to the plate chillers absorbs heat energy from the secondary refrigerant, glycol; the addition of heat energy to the refrigerant causes a change in density.  The less dense refrigerant returns to the suction accumulator where it separates with the vapor being drawn off into the high stage suction header.  The compressors maintain a constant suction pressure in the header.\n\n \n\n1.3.3.                As a result of the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant at Columbus Foods, the facility has developed and implemented a Level 3 Prevention Program in accordance with CalARP 2760 and 40 CFR 68.  Also in place is a Process Safety Management program as required by Cal OSHA Title 8, Section 5189 and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. A Management System has been developed to oversee the regulatory programs at the Columbus Foods facility.   \n\n \n\n1.4.        Worst/Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\n \n\n1.4.1.                Although engineering controls incorporated into the refrigeration process would normally prevent such releases, the possibility of a catastrophic release does exist.  Based on that premise, the facility has modeled three off site consequence analyses; two worst case scenarios, (one for each process) and an alternate case scenario. \n\n \n\n1.4.2.               For all scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 1.07) modeling software was used to determine Off-Site Consequence Analyses.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release and potential receptors are discussed in Section 3.2 and shown on maps in Appendix B of this document.\n\n \n\n1.5.        Emergency Response Program\n\n \n\n1.5.1."

Alarms (both visual and auditory) are strategically placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees will follow in the event of release, which can be found in the facility Emergency Response Plan on file and located with other critical regulatory program documentation. These procedures include appropriate notification and evacuation of facility personnel.\n\n \n\n1.5.2.               In the event that an ammonia release or spill does occur, off-site responders, specifically the South San Francisco Fire Department and the San Mateo County LEPC, and immediate neighboring facilities will be notified."
