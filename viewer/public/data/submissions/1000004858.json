Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Massey Railyard is owned by Dow and is separated from the South Charleston Plant by the CSX Railroad property, highway and other local businesses. The Dow Massey Rail Yard is used to temporarily store tank cars for eventual processing at the South Charleston Plant. The railyard is managed by the South Charleston Plant, but is not considered contiguous by EPA definition with the South Charleston Plant. The CSX Railroad property sits between the Massey Railyard and the South Charleston Plant. No chemical transfer takes place at the Massey Railyard.  Bayer has a contract with Dow to use the Dow Massey Railyard to store chemical raw material and product railcars until they are needed in the Bayer South Charleston Plant or shipped to other destinations in the case of Polyol products.  \n\nACN is a raw material for making various grades of Polyether Polyols. Bayer stores railcars containing acrylonitrile (ACN) at the Dow Massey Railyard.  An ACN Supplier owns a portion of the ACN Railcar(s) fleet and Bayer leases the other portion of the railcars. Bayer owns the ACN material inside the ACN Railcar(s) once it is loaded into the railcars by the acrylon"

Once CSX places the ACN Railcar(s) in the Massey Railyard, the ACN Railcar(s) is no longer under active shipping papers.  Upon request from Bayer and Dow, CSX transfers the ACN Railcar(s) from Massey Railyard, through the CSX Railroad property, onto the South Charleston Plant to the Bayer ACN Unloading Station within the South Charleston Plant.  The South Charleston Plant is owned by Dow, Bayer is a tenant in the facility, and Bayer leases part of the South Charleston Plant for its operations. Bayer stores 1 to 7 ACN Railcars at the Massey Railyard during a typical month.  The DOW Massey Yard is not covered under the PSM Regulations.   Massey Yard is not a process and is a normally unoccupied remote facility. There are no Bayer or DOW employees located at the Union Carbide Massey Railyard.  \n\nIn summary the Bayer portion of DOW Massey Railyard has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemicals and no flammable chemicals. The RMP toxic chemical was modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the distance to toxic endpoint.   \n\nc.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe South Charleston Plant complies with all elements of the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  \n\nd.   Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years with off-site consequences.

The goal is to have 3 A? 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the South Charleston Fire Department.  The Bayer and host site emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire the South Charleston Fire department would likely be involved.  The plant also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems through the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee (KPEPC).\nCommunity warning sirens are placed in multiple places in the Kanawha Valley and there is one within 1 mile of the plant. \n\nThe South Charleston Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\nA?    Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures \nA?    Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\nA?    Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\nA?    Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\nA?
