The Dow Massey Rail Yard is used to temporarily store tank cars for eventual processing at the South Charleston Plant. The railyard is managed by the South Charleston Plant, but is not considered contiguous by EPA definition with the South Charleston Plant. The CSX Railroad property sits between the Massey Railyard and the South Charleston Plant. No chemical transfer takes place at the Massey Railyard.  Bayer has a contract with Dow to use the Dow Massey Railyard to store chemical raw material and product railcars until they are needed in the Bayer South Charleston Plant or shipped to other destinations in the case of Polyol products.  \n\nACN is a raw material for making various grades of Polyether Polyols. Bayer stores railcars containing acrylonitrile (ACN) at the Dow Massey Railyard.  An ACN Supplier owns a portion of the ACN Railcar(s) fleet and Bayer leases the other portion of the railcars.

Once CSX places the ACN Railcar(s) in the Massey Railyard, the ACN Railcar(s) is no longer under active shipping papers.  Upon request from Bayer and Dow, CSX transfers the ACN Railcar(s) from Massey Railyard, through the CSX Railroad property, onto the South Charleston Plant to the Bayer ACN Unloading Station within the South Charleston Plant.  The South Charleston Plant is owned by Dow, Bayer is a tenant in the facility, and Bayer leases part of the South Charleston Plant for its operations. Bayer stores 1 to 7 ACN Railcars at the Massey Railyard during a typical month.  The DOW Massey Yard is not covered under the PSM Regulations.   Massey Yard is not a process and is a normally unoccupied remote facility. There are no Bayer or DOW employees located at the Union Carbide Massey Railyard.  \n\nIn summary the Bayer portion of DOW Massey Railyard has one (1) RMP listed toxic chemicals and no flammable chemicals.

Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe South Charleston Plant complies with all elements of the EPA RMP Rule.

The goal is to have 3 A? 6 emergency squad members always available on shift and this group is supplemented by straight day people, call outs and the South Charleston Fire Department.  The Bayer and host site emergency squad people receive approximately 16 to 24 hours of on-site training annually with some disciplines receiving off-site training as well in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  In the case of a significant fire the South Charleston Fire department would likely be involved.
