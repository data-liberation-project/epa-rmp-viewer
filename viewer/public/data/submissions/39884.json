Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDominion Transmission, Inc. - Hastings Extraction Plant (HEP) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Dominion has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Also, Dominion will contact the Wetzel County Emergency Dispatch to obtain additional resources from local volunteer fire departments, law enforcement and emergency medical services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nHEP processes natural gas by cleaning and dehydrating it prior to introducing it to a turbo-expander where the heavier hydrocarbons are liquefied.  The resulting product, natural gas liquid (NGL), is then separated into its constituent parts by fractionation, which are marketable as fuels or chemical feedstock.  There are four regulated flammable substances present at the facility produced by HEP, which include propane, butane, pentane, and isobutane [propane, 2-methyl].  Propane, butane, isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], and pentane are transported to storage for distribution to end users.\n\nThe maximum inventory of the regulated flammable substances propane, butane, isobutane [2-methyl], and pentane at the facility is present as a flammable mixture in either of two identical NGL storage spheres, which have a capacity of 400,000 pounds each.  The weight of this mixture is 800,000 pounds.  Con"

No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME B31.3.  HEP also maintains an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act (R30103000091996).  A number of processes at the facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHEP maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. HEP primarily uses the HAZOP method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor th"

      "SummaryText": "e purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, HEP maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nHEP develops and implements safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\nTraining\nHEP has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years or more frequently as needed.  Both initial and refresher training is documented and records of training are maintained onsite for at least 3 years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHEP has written procedures for maintaining on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures.  HEP carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at HEP to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  These procedures will be updated as needed.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes will be conducted as a regular practice at HEP.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, and safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHEP conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are documented in a report.  Any corrective actions required from the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner and are also documented.  The facility will maintain the two most recent compliance audit reports.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHEP promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHEP believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit\nHEP will issue a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.  The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\nContractors\nDominion hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work in HEP, they undergo an orientation conducted by the PSM team.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances within HEP, the safe work procedures insisted on by Dominion, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures used at the HEP.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and this information incl"

HEP will document that the contractor has received and understands the training.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at the HEP have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at the HEP.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  The HEP has safety features on many units to help (a) contain/control a release (e.g., diking and enclosures); (b) quickly detect a release (e.g., hydrocarbon detectors with alarms), and (c) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release (e.g., fire suppression and extinguishing).\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThe facility experienced a reportable release on October 31, 2003, when at approximately 11:50 a.m., 21,600 pounds of a flammable mixture (i.e., propane, butanes, and pentane) were consumed in an explosion and fire.  The incident investigation concluded the source of the release was from an open ended valve on the absorber skid.  It is theorized that ice had accumulated in the valve during an upset condition, which prevented the valve from properly seating.  The source of ignition was the control panel in the \"old switch gear building.\"  No onsite or offsite injuries occurred.  Fire and emergency crews responded to the incident, and state agencies such as OSHA and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) were notified.  The facility has taken the following measures to prevent further releases of this nature:  installed a fire detection/gas detection/fire suppressant system; added operators and supervisors, along with new PSM Coordinator and Plant Engineer; and developed new "

      "SummaryText": "operating procedure.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nHEP has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as, the environment.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Marshal/Wetzel County the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nHEP will continue improve safety at the facility through training.  No other upcoming events are planned to improve safety at this time."
