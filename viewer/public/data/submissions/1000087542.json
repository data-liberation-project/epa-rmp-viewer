This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia containing systems. The AB Los Angeles Brewery has developed and implements Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Programs to enhance employee and public safety. \r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented a Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia processes, as required by the RMP rule. The program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental releases from the facility. The facility Prevention Program is a living program that is updated as required to reflect facility changes. Installation of the new SCR process is still in progress and its Prevention Program elements are in the process of being revised. All required Prevention Program elements for this new SCR process will updated prior to startup of this system and prior to storage of a threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia in this process.\r\n\r\nPer the CalARP management system requirements (CCR \u00a7 2735.6) the Prevention Program includes:\r\n - A management system to oversee the implementation of the CalARP Program elements.\r\n - A qualified person designated with overall responsibility for the development and integration of the CalARP Program elements.\r\n\r\nFor the AB Los Angeles Brewery, Mr. Christopher Harden (EHS&S Manager) is the CalARP Coordinator, and has overall responsibility for the development and integration of the program.

      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program is to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and minimize the severity of those releases if they should occur. The Anheuser-Busch, Inc. Los Angeles Brewery (AB Los Angeles Brewery) developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address the CalARP Program requirements (California Code of Regulations [CCR], Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). CalARP requires that RMPs be updated at least every five years. The RMP must also be updated upon implementation of additional qualifying systems or significant modification of qualifying systems. On behalf of the AB Los Angeles Brewery, ERM-West, Inc. (ERM) has prepared this RMP update to satisfy this requirement. The RMP is submitted to the Los Angeles Fire Department, who functions as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for the City of Los Angeles. This RMP covers the anhydrous ammonia used as a refrigerant in the ammonia refrigeration process and to be used as a reducing agent to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the selective catalytic reduction [SCR] process at the brewery in quantities exceeding the Federal quantity threshold of 10,000 pounds and California quantity threshold of 500 pounds in each of their two covered processes.\r\n - Federal: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 40, Parts 9 and 68, Tables 1 and 2\r\n - California: CalARP Regulation - CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 Section 2770.5 (Table 3) \r\n\r\nThe facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.

      "SummaryText": "SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements. These efforts include providing refresher training at least every three years, annual reviews of operating and maintenance procedures, and periodic reviews of process safety information to ensure they are up to date and accurate. Additionally, PHAs and compliance audits are conducted per CalARP requirements to identify potential hazards and confirm the RMP is being properly implemented.\r\n\r\nChanges recommended during the PHA and compliance audit will be evaluated for implementation to improve the overall safety of the facility. The recommended changes can be found in the PHA and compliance audit reports, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn 2020 the Process Hazards were analyzed and re-validated for the ammonia refrigeration system. A PHA was also conducted on the upcoming installation for a SCR system. Changes recommended during the PHA will be evaluated for implementation to improve the overall safety of the facility.\r\n\r\nOther changes already implemented or planned to improve safety include:\r\n - In 2016/2017 a continuous ammonia monitoring/detection system was installed in the machine room (Powerhouse). Upon detection of a high ammonia concentration, the system will alarm and automatically shut down all boilers, ammonia compressors, and other electrical equipment in addition to activating the exhaust ventilation fans in the machine room.\r\n - Installation of additional ammonia sensors are planned to be installed adjacent to the boilers near the SCR injection points."

The AB Los Angeles Brewery's emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (8 CCR 3220) and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER; 29 CFR 1910.120). The Brewery has trained employees for emergency response and maintains an Environmental/Safety Incident Plan (ESIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Los Angeles City Fire Department. Annual drills are conducted for implementation of the ESIP at the brewery. The ESIP includes emergencies such as fires, significant chemical leaks, or spills.\r\n\r\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified. If it is determined that the public needs to be notified, the local agencies perform the notification task.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the AB Los Angeles Brewery has three established response teams, each team meeting or exceeding local, state, or federal standards.  Those teams include the Confined Space Rescue Team, Emergency Medical Response Team, and Spill Response Team (HAZWOPER). All team training must meet or exceed OSHA 1910.120(q) standards. The Spill Response Team is trained to respond to various emergency situations that result in ammonia releases. The Spill Response Team maintains spill response equipment in strategic locations at the brewery for emergency response. All team members are certified to wear self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). The Spill Response Team conducts periodic drills, including annual joint drills with the fire department."

      "SummaryText": "ry located at 15800 Roscoe Boulevard, Van Nuys, California. The brewery originally opened at this location in 1954. The facility occupies approximately 95 acres and operates an approximately 1,700,000 square foot (total floor space) brewery. The brewery utilizes approximately 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to keep the products at their desired temperatures. The ammonia refrigeration system includes, but is not limited to ammonia receivers, oil stills, accumulators, auto purgers, liquid pumps, suction traps, compressors, evaporative condensers, chillers / air units, shell and tube heat exchangers, and piping. \r\n\r\nIn addition, up to approximately 11,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be contained in the SCR process as a reducing agent to control NOx emissions at the facility. The SCR system includes, but is not limited to, ammonia receivers, ammonia injection grid, catalyst reactor, safety systems, valves, and piping.\r\n\r\nNo other substances at the AB Los Angeles Brewery exceed their respective Federal or California threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe CalARP program has different requirements based on the complexity, accident history, and potential impact of releases of the regulated substance. These requirements are divided into three levels: Program 1, Program 2, and Program 3, with Program 3 being the strictest. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenarios for anhydrous ammonia refrigeration and SCR processes result in distance to toxic endpoints that extend past the property boundary. Additionally, both processes are subject to the federal and/or state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards in CFR Title 29, Section 1910.119 and CCR Title 8, Section 5189. Thus, Program Level 3 requirements apply to the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration and SCR processes. \r\n\r\nThe CalARP Program requires Program Level 3 facilities to dev"
