      "SummaryText": "ISLAND WATER ASSOCIATION REVERSE OSMOSIS TREATMENT FACILITY\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Island Water Association Reverse Osmosis Plant (Facility) provides potable water to the\nresidents of Sanibel and Captiva Islands for drinking and fire fighting.  The Facility also removes\nHydrogen Sulfide (H2S), salt and other substances from the brackish water prior to distribution.  The\nFacility uses one regulated substance, chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) as a disinfectant to treat potable\nwater during the chlorination processes.  To accomplish this goal, raw water is pumped from deep\nbrackish wells to the facility. Upon entering the Facility, the raw water is chemically treated, filtered\nand passed into the Reverse Osmosis (RO) treatment system where the salt is removed and the water\nis divided into two components.  The first component is composed of concentrated salt water (brine)\nand H2S, which must undergo further treatment prior to being discharged into the Gulf of Mexico. \nThe second component is referred to as permeate or product water which will be treated further\n(post-treated permeate) before being distributed to Facility customers. The Facility also uses chlorine\nin the sulfide conversion system to eliminate H2S from the permeate.  Once sulfide conversion has\nbeen accomplished, additional chlorine is added to the treated permeate to allow for adequate\ndisinfection. The brine effluent from the RO process is also chlorinated in order to remove hydrogen\nsulfide.  It is then aerated to add oxygen and remove any trace H2S before being discharged into the\nGulf of Mexico.\n\nWhile the chlorination systems at the Facility used for removing H2S, disinfecting the permeate and\ntreating brine are comprised of separate systems, the technology and equipment utilized are the\nsame. The chlorination processes at the facility are operated under a vacuum which is created by the\nejectors.  In the chlorination processes, chlorine gas is pulled from the supply cylinders into\nchlorinators.  From"

The chlorine solution then flows into each stream to be treated.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the chlorination\nprocesses and to evaluate and control where the potential for a chlorine release exists.  Employees\nwere involved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences.  The chlorination\nprocesses were found to be operating safely and no changes were implemented.  The hazard\nassessment was performed on the chlorination processes using the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency RMP*CompTM. Model.  The worst-case release scenario was assumed to be the\nrelease of a one ton cylinder for a duration of 10 minutes in an enclosed building.  The alternative\nrelease scenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed during the process hazard\nreview and analysis.  In this scenario, the PHA team determined that a leak may develop at a fuse\nplug on a one ton cylinder due to corrosion or a poor bond between the lead alloy and the plug\nretainer would be the most likely cause of a chlorine gas release.  The cylinders are constructed in\ncompliance with applicable codes and standards and are hydrostatically tested as required. \nTherefore, the likelihood of this scenario occurring is minimal and an accidental release of this type\nhas not occurred at the Facility since it initiated operation. \n\nIn addition, the Facility has the capability of responding to and stopping the leak.  For both\nscenarios, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors could be potentially\nimpacted by the release of chlorine.  Although off-site areas would be impacted, we believe that\nsafety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for off-site consequences an"

In addition, the chlorine cylinders are housed\nin a building with exhaust fans and vents, which would dilute the chlorine gas concentration should\na release occur.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed an\naccidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP and the OSHA PSM\nprograms.  The prevention program ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and\nthat any risk of an accidental release of chlorine is minimized.  The program has been written to\nreduce the potential of an accidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility. \nIn order to prevent the release of chlorine due to human error, our prevention program ensures that\noperating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our\nprogram.  Employees and contractors working on the chlorination processes are required to be\ntrained in the chlorination processes and the hazards of chlorine.   \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that\nequipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance are in accordance with accepted\nengineering practices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All chlorine cylinders are\nexamined upon delivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In addition, equipment\npertaining to the chlorine process is visually inspected daily.
