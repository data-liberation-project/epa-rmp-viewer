Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nMosaic Fertilizer, LLC corporate environmental organization supports site prevention and emergency response programs with resources such as funding and training.  Each facility maintains emergency prevention and response procedures and equipment appropriate to the hazards onsite.   \n\n2.    Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Mosaic Riverview facility is located at 8813 US Highway 41 South in Riverview, Florida.  Ammonia is used as a raw material in the Mosaic facility.  The ammonia is stored in tanks as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The ammonia is then piped to the monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) plants.  Liquefied or gaseous ammonia may pose a health risk if the compressors, containers, or lines transferring the ammonia develop leaks or rupture.   Ammonia is brought into the facility via the Tampa Bay Pipeline into one storage vessel (bullet). The capacity of the bullet is 200 tons. Administrative controls at the facility limit the quantity of ammonia stored in the bullet to 175 tons.   The hazardous properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the hazard to facility personal and contractors, and to reduce the hazard to the community. \n3.    Prevention Program\n\nBased on a review of the applicable regulations, Prevention Program 3 requirements apply to this facility.   The main focus of the prevention program is to reduce the likelihood of a release by enforcing written safety and operational procedures, maintaining equipment and training staff and contractors.   \n\n4.    Accident History\n\nThere have been no offsite consequences in the past five years.\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe current plan is coordinated with the Hillsborough County Emergency Response and they can be notified by dialing (813) 272-6600."
