Hydrochloric acid is used at the facility above the threshold, which requires Hamlin to develop a Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe date of the most recent review of the safety information and industry-specific design codes and standards was conducted on May 21, 2004. A letter of correspondence (e-mail) from Triad Engineering (the design and build contractor) is included in the appendix of this section to verify this element.\n\nA hazard review was completed on June 14, 2004. Included in the review were the major hazards, process controls in use, mitigation systems, monitoring and detection systems, human factors, and changes since operation start-up. A detailed hazard review has been included in the appendix of this section.\n\nOperating procedures are routinely reviewed as part of ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) and ISO/TS 16949 Quality System audits.  The last audit conducted of this process area was completed 10/31/02.  The RMP Compliance Audit is included in the appendix of this section.\n\nTraining programs are routinely reviewed as part of the ISO 14001 EMS and ISO/TS 16949 Quality System audits.  Training is conducted for individuals who are responsible for maintaining the hydrochloric acid system.  Training includes emergency response, DOT Hazmat, chemical handling, RCRA, and On the Job.  Tests, quizzes and checklists are used to demonstrate competency for the referenced topics.\n\nMaintenance procedures are routinely reviewed as part of the ISO 14001 EMS and ISO/TS 16949 audits.  The last update to the offloading procedure occurred in October 2003.  Equipment is inspected and used daily.  Inspections include visual observations and preventive maintenance checks.\n\nA compliance audit was completed on April 26, 2004. There was one current action item that was completed on May 10, 2004. Action items identified from the compliance audit are completed and closed. The RMP Compliance Audit is included in the appendix of this section.\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents to investigate.\n\nChanges to the covered process area have been replacement in kind.  The hydrochloric acid system is still intact as designed.",

Both EPA and OSHA consider this chemical hazardous. Hydrochloric acid is used in the general manufacturing process which includes pressing, annealing, cleaning and plating of reed blades and the assembly of reed switches, relays and sensors. Hydrochloric acid has been utilized is a safe manner at this facility. No release of significant nature has occurred within the operating history of the plant. It is the policy of Hamlin to adhere to the Federal and State laws governing the use of chemicals but to extend Hamlin's safety, health and environmental efforts beyond that of government requirements. Hamlin is a registered facility for ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS). Hamlin received this designation in June 2002 and has successfully achieved recertification for three subsequent audits. Hamlin is committed to the safety and health of the employees and the well being of the community.\n\nHamlin's emergency response program is based on OSHA and EPA models for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) regulations. Hamlin coordinates all emergency activities internally with provisions to incorporate and organize efforts with local and state agencies.\n\nThe stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\nThe plating and cleaning process uses concentrated hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid is maintained within the system, consisting of a single storage tank for hydrochloric acid with a secondary tank acting as a safety capture system in case of over-fill or a tank leak.  The secondary tank has the capacity of 110% of the storage tank.  In addition, the tank is located inside and the chemical room is also designed as a containment area.  Deliveries are scheduled 2-3 times per year and accomplished through tractor-trailer delivery.  The fill port "

In addition, since the initial plan submittal, offloading procedures have been developed to minimize any significant release.  A spill berm and a collection sump have been constructed to contain and manage any outside release.  The hydrochloric acid tank is housed inside and includes a tank-in-tank system designed to contain any spills or leaks from the original storage vessel.  A real time level sensor monitors the tank at all times and is recorded daily.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nHamlin has had no incidents involving hydrochloric acid over the last five years."
