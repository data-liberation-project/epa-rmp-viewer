KFB's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKFB produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Ammonia is also injected into an ammonia pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is sold to third party entities, liquefied in the facility's CO2 plant and sold, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia and an aqueous ammonia solution are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at KFB in amounts above threshold quantity.  Chlorine was reported in previous RMPs, but has been removed as the facility no longer uses"

      "SummaryText": "it for water treatment in the cooling water system.  All chlorine cylinders have been removed from the facility and replaced with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), which is not an RMP substance, for use in the cooling tower.   An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\r\n\r\nThis RMP update is required under the RMP rule due to changes in the ammonia unit, which resulted in a hazard and operability study on the primary reformer.  Included in this update is the addition of an aqueous ammonia solution as an RMP toxic substance.  This solution is periodically stored at a concentration greater than 20% ammonia and may, depending on operational needs, exceed 20,000 pounds of ammonia in the solution.  To be conservative, the quantity of solution stored on-site is being reported as the greatest quantity that may be held in the system.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n  \r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the protective performance standards adopted by KFB.  These high standards include:\r\n\r\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nKFB is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped"

A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\t\t\r\n-\tRemoving chlorine in the cooling towers and replacing it with sodium hypochlorite thereby reducing the risk of a toxic release from the facility.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\r\n-\tMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) in place.\r\n-\tProviding a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\r\n-\tInstalling ammonia detectors to help ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\r\n-\tInstalling low-pressure trip switches on ammonia loading hoses to stop product transfer in the event of a hose rupture.\r\n-\tRequiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and emergency equipment in control rooms and throughout the plant.\r\n-\tProviding emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated in case of an ammonia release.\r\n-\tEquipping the rail loading scale with an automatic shutdown that will prohibit further product movement upon reaching the weight of a full railcar.  \r\n-\tRequiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\r\n-\tProviding level indications on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\r\n-\tProviding a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia release.\r\n-\tInstalling cameras at the gate and process areas for early detection of upsets.\r\n\r\n \r\n Five-Year Accident History\r\n \r\n Within the last five years, KFB has experienced one incident reportable in the five-year accident history of the RMP regu"

      "SummaryText": "lation.  This incident occurred on October 7, 2013 and resulted in the evacuation of county road workers at a nearby building and road project as a precautionary measure.   No injuries, deaths or environmental damage occurred during this October 2013 incident.\r\n \r\n \r\n Emergency Response Program\r\n \r\n The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any necessary emergency response actions with the Beatrice Rural Fire Department and the Gage County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Beatrice Hazardous Materials Team, Beatrice Community Hospital, the Nebraska State Patrol, Norris Public Power, and Trailblazer (Tall Grass Energy) Gas Pipeline (natural gas supplier).  The KFB Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n \r\n \r\n Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n \r\n Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\r\n \r\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\r\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\r\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an int"
