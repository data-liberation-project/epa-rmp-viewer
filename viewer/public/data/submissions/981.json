Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company in Oberon are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Oberon Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Oberon (Figure 1).  The maximum amount\nstored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 35.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFarmers Union Oil Company maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nFarmers Union Oil Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFarmers Union Oil Company conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.
