      "SummaryText": "Rio Bravo Rocklin\nExecutive Summary\n\n1. Accidental release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Rio Bravo Rocklin facility uses ammonia to help maintain air quality compliance of the emissions stack, specifically, reducing the NOx (NO and NO2) emissions. Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental release and injuries. It is the policy of Rio Bravo Rocklin to conduct all operations (including the ammonia Thermal DeNOx system) in a safe manner. This policy extends to all employees and contractors employed by the facility. Rio Bravo Rocklin implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings and safety reviews/evaluations. These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. In the event of an ammonia accident the facility has an Emergency Response Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nGeneral Overview\nThe Rio Bravo Rocklin facility utilizes the ammonia in the Thermal DeNOx system installed on the combustion Engineering Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustor which processes biomass for generating steam. Biomass waste is charged to the boiler and is combusted in the fluidized bed. Particulate laden flue gases travel upward through the combustion chamber. At the top, the flue gases flow into a cyclone and the cleaner flue gases exit overhead. Ammonia is injected into the outlet flue gas piping downstream of the cyclone.\nFacility Details\nThe ammonia injection system uses approximately 55,000 pounds of ammonia for the Thermal DeNOx system at Rio Bravo Rocklin. \nThe system involves the storage and vaporization of liquid ammonia, and injection of the vaporized ammonia into the boiler through the injection nozzles. As the ammonia leaves the injection nozzles,"

      "SummaryText": " it expands as a free jet inside the boiler. This action entrains the flue gas, mixing it with the ammonia and promoting the Thermal DeNOx reaction.\nLiquid ammonia is brought onsite by trucks complete with an on board ammonia vapor compressor that transfers the vapor to the ammonia storage tank. The liquid ammonia is stored in a horizontal ammonia storage tank with a 12,000 gallon capacity. The facility keeps the vessel filled only to a limit of approximately 80% of capacity.\nTo ensure adequate supply of ammonia vapor is available for the process one installed vaporizer can be utilized. The vaporizer is located at an elevation lower than the bottom of the ammonia storage tank so it can be gravity filled with liquid ammonia. Ammonia vapor from the head space of the storage tank is injected into the boiler. The purpose of the vaporizer is to maintain a vapor pressure in the storage tank above 45 psig, which is the vapor pressure of liquid ammonia @ 30degF. Due to the large surface area of the storage tank, heat input to the system from the vaporizer will be unnecessary except during times of low ambient temperatures.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn order to operate the Thermal DeNOx system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\nA?    OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM)\nA?    EPAA?s Risk Management Program (RMP); and\nA?    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP)\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The ammonia system employed at Rio Bravo Rocklin facility is equipped with various system controls and status indicators intended to minimize potential ammonia related accidents and to allow operators to monitor the system operations. This monitoring system is comprised of pressure indicators, as well as other system safeguards and methods for allowing facility operators to effectively monitor"

The set point for the sensor is 25ppm and is connected to the facility control system. It alarms through the facility control system.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no significant releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity over the past five years or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonium release.\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in effect at the facility. This ERP was designed to meet the following objectives:\nA?    Save lives;\nA?    Minimize and avoid injuries;\nA?    Protect the environment; and\nA?    Minimize property damage.\nThe ERP provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. The ERP is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations. Facility Personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\n5. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis, performed on August 8, 2007, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Rio Bravo Rocklin facility located in Lincoln, CA. The mitigation measure include additional training, key maintenance related tests and inspections, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The Rio Bravo Rocklin safety committee is planning to complete these items by August 31, 2009. \n"
