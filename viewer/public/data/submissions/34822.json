The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigation, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect change and RMP requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  Floralife has coordinated response with the Colleton County Rural Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the pentane system.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure the fire department will be properly notified when any response is needed for a pentane release.  Based on this coordination with the local emergency responders, the facility is not required to implement additional RMP emergency response program requirements.\n\nSafety Management and Changes:  Floralife is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  The senior manager is committed to maintain the safety of the RMP covered pentane system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP.  Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities.\n\nSummary:  As documented in this submittal, the RMP for the facility has been completed in accordance with 40 CFR 68 requirements and the facility has certified co"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview:  The Floralife, Inc., (Floralife) facility is located in Walterboro, South Carolina.  The facility manufacturer\u00bfs phenolic foam and dextrose based flower food.  The facility is regulated under RMP due to on-site pentane storage in excess of the RMP applicability threshold.  Pentane is used as a process chemical for foam production.  Pentane is stored in a storage tank having a capacity of 46,800 pounds.\n\nChemical Safety Overview:  Floralife\u00bfs overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing management, training, procedure and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for pentane in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility\u00bfs RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes, and standards (OSHA PSM Standard, US EPA 40 CFR 68 and NFPA guidance for pentane).\n\nRelease Scenario\u00bfs:  Worst-case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility\u00bfs single largest vessel based on US EPA\u00bfs Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance.  The worst-case release scenario is a 1 psi explosion of 46,800 pounds of pentane and the alternate release scenario assumes a puncture in a supply line resulting in a release of 150 pounds per minute of pentane.  There are no public receptors within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternate release scenarios.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release impact zones were 0.3 miles and 0.1 miles, respectively.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  Floralife has had no RMP reportable accidents/releases of pentane within the last five years.\n\nPrevention Program:  Floralife has implemented a Program Level 3 Prevention Program for pentane, as required by the RMP rule, in accordance with the US EPA guidance document.  These prevention program provisions are spe"
