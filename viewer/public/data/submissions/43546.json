Further details regarding the WPCP accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are included in Section 7 and Appendices A and B of this RMP.\n\n3.3 WPCP and Regulated Substance\n\nAs discussed in Section 1 of this RMP, the WPCP facility stores up to 4,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine in one ton cylinders within the chlorine building.  This storage quantity exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine of 2,500 pounds as specified in the 112 (r) rule.  The chlorine gas is used at the facility in the secondary treatment of the wastewater prior to the discharge of the effluent to the Oswego River.   Figure 1 shows the location of the chlorine building.\n\n3.4 Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nIn accordance with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)'s Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the worst case scenario consists of the instantaneous release of a chlorine cylinder's maximum contents (up to 2,000 pounds).  In determining this worst case scenario, the rate of the release was not considered.  Per USEPA's guidance, the release of gaseous chlorine is a passive mitigated release.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 3.5 miles in accordance with guidelines established in USEPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis guidan"

The source location results in a radius of influence corresponding to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l that extends beyond the property boundaries of the facility in all directions.  Using LandView? 6, the residential population within the radius of influence is 18,000 persons with approximately 8,000 households.  The public receptors identified within the radius of influence were determined to be schools, residences, hospitals, public recreational areas and major commercial, office, or industrial areas.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario was performed assuming that the quantity of chlorine gas released was 1,000 pounds over a ten (10) minute period with a stability class of D.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.81 miles.  The source location resulted in a radius of influence corresponding to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l that extends the beyond the property boundaries of the facility in all directions.  The residential population within the radius of influence was determined, using LandView? 6, to be 2,300 persons with approximately 1,000 households.  The public receptors identified within the radius of influence were determined to be schools, residences, religious institutions, and major commercial, office, or industrial areas.  There were no identified environmental receptors within the radius of influence. \n\n3.5 General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nDue to the Program 3 status of the WPCP facility, the facility is required under Section 112(r) of the CAA to develop a Prevention Program.\n\n3.6 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe WPCP facility has not experienced any accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years (February 2000-February 2005).\n\n3.7 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe current WPCP facility emergency response program requires coordination with local emergency response agencies, and includes provisions for public notification in the event of a rele"
