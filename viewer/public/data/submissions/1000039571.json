In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophicaccidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemcial including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement ofsuch chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be invovled in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nAnyhydrous ammoinia is used as a refrigerant at Cargill.  Mechanical refrigerationis a thermodynamic process rather than a chemical process.  Ammonia, the refrigerant is used as a heat transfer media to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists of four processes:  evaporation, condesnation, compression, and expansion.  Evaporation and condesnation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.  Compresion and expansion are designed to hange the availability of the associated energy.

      "SummaryText": " ammonia refrigeration cycle is in a closed system utilizing fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization for cooling.  To evaporate liquid ammonia to a vapor, latent heat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid.\n\n\n\nThis location has prepared wworst case and alternative case release scenarios using the RMP Comp modeling software which calculates the distance to the toxic endpoints.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is ocmprised of the following components:  process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the particpation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notigying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\n\n\n\nIn the five years preceeding the submittal of this RMP, this faciltiy has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nCargill's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Harrisonburg Joint Local Emergency Planning C"

We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire departments.  The facility is a VPP \"Star\" designated site and has been ISO 14001/OHSAS 18001 certified last May 2011.  These designations/certifications have improved our management systems.\n\n\n\nThe process hazard analysis report prepared for the facility in July 14, 2009 identified various recommendations to minimize the risk of accidental releases and improve safety related to the ammonia refrigeration system. The PHA findings will be completed no later than December 30, 2012."
