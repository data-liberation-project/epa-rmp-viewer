The Y-Grade is stored in two 30,000 gallon pressurized Y-Grade storage tanks until it can be shipped out of the facility via truck.  Other storage at the facility includes one 2,000 gallon propane storage tank utilized to store propane which is used as a refrigerant.  The total storage capacity of the pressurized storage tanks exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold, for flammable substances.  Therefore, the facility is subject to the regulations found in the Risk Management Program.  Because the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.  There are no public receptors within the calculated worst case vapor cloud explosion distance, which has been calculated by RMP Comp. as being 0.4 miles.  This is based on the complete release of one of the 30,000 gallon pressurized storage tanks, which would release 111,500 lbs of flammable materials.  Since the nearest public receptor is estimated to be more than 4 miles away, we are registering the plant under the requirements of a Program Level 1 facility.  \n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Bridge facility was constructed in 2005 by Westport Field Services.  The company was purchased by Kerr McGee in the fall of 2005 and Kerr McGee was purchased by APC in the fall of 2006.  The facility was transferred to the Anadarko Uintah Midstream, LLC to allow it be included in the midstream activities of the parent company.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by the regulation.\n\nAccidental Release History\n \nThere was a flash fire at the facility in 2007, which injured one employee.  The incident occurred as the result of a small (none reportable quantity) gas release that was pulled into the intake manifold of one of the compressors, resulting in a backfire that ignited the methane gas that had been released.  The injured employee was attempting to sta"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for the Bridge Compressor Station and Gas Processing Facility\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  It is our policy to implement reasonable controls that provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  In a situation that may require it, Anadarko employees and it\u00bfs wholly owned operating company, Anadarko Uintah Midstream, LLC will notify and cooperate with all emergency response agencies.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Bridge Compressor Station and Gas Processing facility is located about 40 miles south of Vernal, UT, just off Glen Bench Road. The area surrounding the plant is a rocky desert with limited grazing.  The majority of this land is owned by the US Government and administrated by the BLM. The facility includes compression, dehydration, and a natural gas liquid recovery system using propane refrigeration. The plant produces LPG liquid which is a mixture of hydrocarbons including:  ethane (C2), propane (C3), iso and normal butane (IC4 & NC4), iso and normal pentane (IC5 & NC5), and some hexane and heptane. This mixture is referred to as Y-Grade liquid and is shipped under the DOT name of Petroleum Gas, Liquefied.  The hexane and heptane are shown in the analysis as C6+.  The volumes of C6+ were left out of the calculations as they are not considered to be flashing liquids.  The principal purpose of the plant is to remove water and heavier hydrocarbons from the produced natural gas, thus lowering the dew point and BTU"

His injuries were serious, but not life-threatening and he returned to work within two months after the incident.  As a result of this incident, changes in the maintenance procedures that caused the release of methane have been made and the likelihood of a similar occurrence has been significantly reduced.\n\nAccident Prevention Program\n\nThis facility is covered by a consent agreement with the EPA, requiring us to report any releases.  Toward that end, APC is committed to safety and has improved the training efforts toward making this and all other facilities a safer place to work.  We have continued the policy of treating this facility as if it were covered under OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard as well as applying all of the APC safe work programs toward work activities conducted at the facility.   This includes Mechanical Integrity, Written Operating Procedures, Employee Participation, Emergency Response, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Management of Change, Hot Work,  Permit to Work, LO/TO, PPE, Hazcom, Confined Space entry, H2S, Respiratory Protection, Hearing Conservation, Electrical Safe Work Practices, Accident Investigation, Compliance Audits,  fall protection and excavation safety.  All operators have been trained to the standards required by APC in each of these topics.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility operations staff and area management are committed to improving the safety performance at this and other facilities in the area.  Toward this end, we perform regular safety audits and have implemented a safety improvement program that includes behavior based safety training, an incident investigation and review program as well as continued adherence to all the safety programs required by APC and regulatory agencies."
