In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s),  Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\",  however we are also engaged  in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading is # 493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle Propane  for  both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectents and petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.   During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs .  The maxi"

      "SummaryText": "mum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is     130,000   Lbs. The maximum on site vessel size is     30,000     Gallons, storing   130,000   Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi- trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site,  therefore the answer to item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout the year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be   130,000   Lbs.  based on\n85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is    4.4   miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual,  self closing excess flow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06  miles (317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Relea"

(ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".   We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves,   Emergency shut-off valves,  Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.   We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers, and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan.
