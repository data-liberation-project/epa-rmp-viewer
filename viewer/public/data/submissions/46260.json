      "SummaryText": "International Paper (IP) owns and operates the Riverdale Mill, an integrated pulp and paper mill, located in central Alabama about 10 miles east of Selma.  As part of its commitment to environmental concerns, the Riverdale Mill converted the pulp bleaching process from elemental chlorine (i.e., chlorine gas, or Cl2) to chlorine dioxide (ClO2).  IP has two ClO2 generators that create chlorine dioxide solution at 9.5 grams per liter (g/L) to 10.5 g/L.  The generated ClO2 is then stored in three tanks before being used in the bleaching process.\n\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Managment Program (RMP) regulates ClO2 when it is stored in solutions above 10 g/L (i.e., one weight percent) with a total mass of ClO2 greater than or equal to 1,000 pounds (lbs), and is thus applicable to the Riverdale Mill.  Because the Riverdale Mill is a pulp and paper mill and because the worst-case modeling impacts predict the potential for offsite consequences, Program 3 of the RMP is applicable.  Program 3 requires both a worst-case modeling analysis and an alternative modeling analysis.\n\nThe worst-case analysis has release conditions explicitly specified by U.S. EPA.  The chance of a worst-case release scenario occuring are very low.  Quoting from the U.S. EPA General Guidance for Risk Management Programs (EPA 550-B-98-003), page 4-4,\n\n          Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results\n          likely will be very conservative.  The endpoints specified for the regulated toxic substances are\n          intended to be protective of the general public.  These endpoints are concentrations below which\n          it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour without any serious\n          health effects.  In addition, the worst-case analysis is carried out using very conservative\n          assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under\n          worst-case conditions shoul"

EPA intends the estimated distances to provide\n          a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public,\n          rather than a basis for any specific actions.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Riverdale Mill is the complete rupture of the largest of the three ClO2 storage tanks.  Based on that release combined with the conservative parameters mandated by U.S. EPA, the impact radius extends into general public areas.  As noted above in the quote from U.S. EPA, the worst-case scenario represents the \"maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.\"\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Riverdale Mill is a pipe leak.  IP has installed numerous sensors in the ClO2 area to detect a ClO2 leak.  IP expects that a pipe leak would be detected and eliminated within a five minute period.  For the purposes of this analysis, a ten minute release duration is assumed.  Based on average weather conditions at the site, the endpoint does extend offsite, but the offsite areas it covers are only the county road to the plant and a small portion of a farmer's field, with zero population.\n\nIP takes safety seriously.  IP complies with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and the Riverdale Mill has OSHA Voluntary Protection Programs Star status.  Approval into VPP is OSHA\u00bfs official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.  Note that there have not been any ClO2 accidents during the last five years.\n\nThe Riverdale Mill is prepared to respond in case of an emergency.

As backup, the Mill also has written agreements for fire emergencies with the Selma Fire Department and for hazmat emergencies with the Prattville Fire Department.  Both Selma and Prattville fire departments have copies of the Mill's emergency response plan.\n\nWhile the possibility of an accident at the Riverdale Mill exists, the potential is low and IP takes preventive actions (through the OSHA prevention program and the emergency reponse program) to minimize any accident that might occur."
