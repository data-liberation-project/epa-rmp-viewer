The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nLambent Technologies Corporation (LTC) and its parent company Petroferm Inc. have and will continue to commit resources to continue improving the safety of its operation and reducing the risk of hazardous chemical accidents/incidents/releases. As described below, LTC\u00bfs focus is to develop accident prevention strategies and to prepare for accidents through emergency response planning, practice and training.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nLTC manufactures various types of surfactants, including detergents, emulsifiers, wetting agents, and esters used as raw materials in cosmetics, foods, industrial lubricants, and agricultural products.  The manufacturing processes utilized by LTC consist primarily of chemical blending and reactions. The primary raw materials at this facility are agricultural seed oils such as soybean oil and canola oil. The operations conducted at this site have remained essentially the same, except for expansion, since Hodag began manufacturing operations here in 1948. More information about Petroferm Inc. and Lambent Technologies is available on the Internet at www.lambentcorp.com.\n\nRegulated substances handled at LTC are ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO). Both materials are toxic, flammable gases that are delivered to the site as liquefied gases by railcar (EO) and tank truck (PO). These compounds are used as raw materials to convert hydrocarbons such as canola oil into surfactants. Soaps and detergents are classic examples of surfactants. The products manufactured from EO and PO are present in many household products such as baby shampoo, skin care lotions, salad dressings and pickles. EO is also widely used in smaller quantities in hospitals.  More information about EO is available at www.ethyleneoxide.com.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nLTC\u00bfs prevention program is founded upon OS"

LTC\u00bfs program includes 13 management practices that are designed to reduce the risk of releasing hazardous chemicals in the workplace and subsequently to the environment.\nThe practical aspects of the PSM program address the prevention of:\n\u00bfHuman error \u00bf through well developed operating procedures and employee training; \n\u00bfMechanical failure \u00bf through a preventive maintenance program that provides for annual inspection and maintenance of process equipment;\n\u00bfHeat exposure \u00bf through control of hot work through an internal permitting procedure;\n\u00bfCareless Process Modifications \u00bf through management of change and pre-start up safety review procedures; and\n\u00bfContractor error \u00bf through a contractor screening and management procedure.\n\nThe PSM program also includes the following procedures that generate feedback for the effectiveness of the program and its implementation as another means of risk reduction:\n\u00bfProcess hazard analyses \u00bf identify potential incident scenarios and prevention measures;\n\u00bfSelf audits of program compliance ensure that the prevention plan is properly implemented; and\n\u00bfIncident investigation procedure \u00bf analyze causes to identify additional prevention measures needed.\n\nAdditionally, following mitigation measures have been implemented to lessen seriousness of an event if one did occur:\n\u00bfReleases of EO and PO are more likely to result in fire or explosion with much smaller radii of impact than in drifting vapor clouds (this is a mitigating factor and not an intentional measure).  This statement is based on the case histories of EO incidents reported in the EO manual (published by EO manufacturers and available at www.ethyleneoxide.com), not on experience at the LTC site.\n\u00bfPressure relief valves on the EO and PO tanks at the facility are directed vertically upward to cause better mixing and dilution if gases are released to the atmosphere.

      "SummaryText": "the off site impact of a gas release is significantly reduced by directing of the discharge upward.\n\nThe facility has also implemented the following administrative controls that reduce the probability of an EO or PO release:\n\u00bfRoutine inspections of storage tanks, rail cars, tank trucks and safety equipment;\n\u00bfEO and PO storage tanks are only connected to other containers during transfer operations to reduce the risk of leaks; they are securely closed at all other times;\n\u00bfAccess to the EO and PO processes is restricted to specially trained operators who are issued keys required to transfer these materials;\n\u00bfStorage tanks are partially bunkered and protected by a secondary containment wall;\n\u00bfA nitrogen blanket is maintained in the storage tanks to inert the vapor in the tanks.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nLTC has not had a reportable release within the past 5 years.\n \n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nLTC has worked and continues to work in cooperation with the Skokie Fire Department and the Villages of Skokie and Lincolnwood, IL to integrate the facility-specific emergency response plan into the community emergency response plan.  The cooperative effort started soon after the facility was acquired by Petroferm in 1998.\n\nLTC\u00bfs emergency response plan assigns specific responsibilities to its staff to:\n\u00bfProvide critical information to emergency responders;\n\u00bfNotify local agencies of any emergency; and\n\u00bfNotify local authorities of the danger, if any, to areas surrounding the facility.\n\n\n6.Planned changes to improve safety\n\nPetroferm Inc. acquired the LTC facility in March 1998. Petroferm has already accomplished manyl facility improvements to reduce the risk of a chemical release, such as:\n\u00bfImproved security;\n\u00bfBetter isolation of the EO handling system;\n\u00bfInstallation of a water deluge system for the EO railcar; and\n\u00bfRedundant safety valves to prevent over pressurization of the EO rail car.\n\u00bfInstallation of a dedicated nitrogen system for the EO process;\n\u00bfInstallation of te"
