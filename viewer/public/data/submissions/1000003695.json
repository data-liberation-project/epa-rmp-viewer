      "SummaryText": "The City of Lancaster Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWWTP) is owned and operated by the City of Lancaster for the sole purpose of treating wastewater, which is a combination of residential, commercial, and industrial used water discharges.\n\nThe City's AWWTP collects wastewater from the City of Lancaster and portions of Manheim Township, Lancaster Township, East and West Lampeter Townships, Strasburg Borough, Upper Leacock Township, West Earl Township, Manor Township, and Pequea Township.  Upon collection and arrival at the AWWTP, wastewater is physically treated through screening and primary clarification, in which inorganic and organic solids are removed.\n\nBiological treatment of the wastewater follows primary clarification.  The biological treatment of wastewater further removes organic material as well as the nutrients ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus.  Final clarification then separates the mixture of wastewater and active biological solids.  The majority of biological solids (biosolids) are reused to treat incoming wastewater, but a portion of these biosolids are disposed of via reducing the water content and then landfilling.  Chlorine and Sodium Bisulfite are used to disinfect and dechlorinate the wastewater respectively.  After dechlorination, the processed wastewater is discharged to the Conestoga River.  The rated capacity of the AWWTP is 29.73 million gallons per day.  All materials used in processing wastewater and materials derived from wastewater are handled and disposed of properly.  Any materials that are found outside their containment area are promptly cleaned up, as to prevent environmental contamination in the form of stormwater, groundwater, air, or soil contamination.   \n\nTo prevent, prepare, and rectify chemical releases that pose an environmental or public health threat, the AWWTP utilizes the following:  City of Lancaster Emergency Management Plan, AWWTP Preparedness, Prevention and Contingincy (PPC) Plan, and the AWWTP's Risk Manageme"

This exective summary focuses strictly on the AWWTP's RMP.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III approved the AWWTP's RMP during their compliance audit on April 14, 2000.  The RMP includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release of chlorine gas, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The emergency response program was developed by the Local Emergency Planning committee (LEPC) of Lancaster County and is updated yearly. \n\n\nRMP Summary:\n \nThe following Risk Management Program (RMP) quoted language has been taken directly from Environmental Publication (EPA) 550-B-98-010.  This publication has specific guidance requirements and calculation procedures for Wastewater Treatment Plants regulated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act.  The purpose of this RMP is to bring the City of Lancaster's AWWTP into compliance with Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nDefinition Risk Management Program versus Risk Management Plan:\n\nThe phrase risk management program refers to all of the requirements of part 68, which must be implemented on an on-going basis.  The phrase risk management plan refers to the document summarizing the risk management program that you must submit to EPA.\n \nDue to the fact that the AWWTP is covered under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the following activities must be undertaken:\n\nCovered facilities must develop and implement a RMP and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The RMP will include and analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nCovered facilities also must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan, which includes registration information, to EPA no later than June 21, 1999, or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold qua"

The RMP will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies and the public.\n\nCovered facilities also must continue to implement the RMP and update their RMPs periodically or when processes change, as required by the rule.\n\nThe AWWTP is covered because it is a stationary source that stores chlorine above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in a single process.\n\nProcess: Any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process. \n\nVessel: Any container, from a single drum or pipe to a large storage tank or sphere.\n\nThe AWWTP stores one (1) ton chlorine cylinders for the purpose of disinfecting wastewater before it enters the Conestoga River.  Administrative limits are set for the maximum quantity stored on site.  If only one cylinder was used at a time, the City's AWWTP would not be required to develop a Risk Management Program because they would be under the 2,500 pound threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of wastewater chlorinated at the Lancaster AWWTP, it is necessary to manifold two chlorine cylinders together.  Since this manifold creates a process of 4,000 pounds, the AWWTP was required to develop a Risk Management Program.  The AWWTP's chlorination process ends when the Cl2 mixes with the process water.\n  \nStandard operating procedures at the Lancaster AWWTP direct personnel to only change chlorine when all chlorine is removed from the network by vacuum.  After all chlorine is drained for the system, two new cylinders are connected to the manifold.  At no time is there more than 4,000 pounds of chlorine within the process.\n\nSince it was determined that the Lancaster AWWTP has to develop a RMP and it falls under the classification of a Program 2, the following is required:\n\n(1)  Hazard Assess"

You may decide that other steps are as effective as the recommended actions or that the risk is too low to merit the expense.  You must, however, document your decision on each recommendation.  If you are implementing a recommendation, you should document the schedule for implementation.  If you are taking other steps to address the problem or decide the problem does not merit action, you should document the basis for your decision.

This certification should kept in your files; you do not need to submit it to EPA.\n\nWorkers at the Lancaster AWWTP have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures.  All operators are trained by the management staff and are accompanied during all chlorine handling activities until they demonstrate they are competent in all aspects of the process.  Observation by the Operations Supervisors is the method used to determine if an operator understands and has the ability to operate the process safely.  Additional refresher training is provided by the Operations Staff on a yearly basis.\n\nAdditional safety, operating, and training procedures were taken from the Operation of Wastewater Treatment Plants; Volume 2.  This training manual contains pertinent information pertaining to the operations at the Lancaster WWTP, and pages of this manual are included with the RMP.  Safety and training videos published by The Chorine Institute are used to help educate the WWTP operators.\n\n\n(5)Maintenance\n\nPreventive maintenance, inspection, and testing of equipment is critical to safe operations.  Waiting for equipment to fail often means waiting for an accident that could harm people and the environment.  Further, a thorough maintenance program will save y"

For most of the equipment in a WWTP, the manufacturer will have supplied maintenance instructions.  These can be used to fulfill the requirement for maintenance procedures.  Where such instructions are not available, you will need to develop them. (6-22)\n\nContained in the RMP are manufacturers\u00c2\u00bf recommended maintenance procedures for equipment used in the chlorination process.  Inspection and testing information was also obtained from the Operation of Wastewater Treatment Plants; Volume 2.  \n\nAt the Lancaster AWWTP, procedures used to maintain the mechanical integrity of the chlorination process are followed.  Maintenance procedures are based on manufacturers\u00c2\u00bf recommendations, prior operating experience, and industry standards.\n\nIn the RMP, you are required to report on the date of the most recent review or revision of your maintenance procedures and the date of the most recent equipment inspection or test and equipment inspected or tested.  You must keep on site your written procedures and schedules as well as any agreements you have with contractors.  (6-24)\n\nAt the Lancaster AWWTP, the Maintenance Supervisor has a computer system that automatically generates work orders.  These work orders are completed by the maintenance staff and are stored on file.  A maintenance monthly checklist was developed to document preventative maintenance and other necessary work performed on the chlorination system.  A person trained in the startup and shutdown of the chlorine system shall accompany maintenance personnel.\n\nAlong with the manufacturers\u00c2\u00bf maintenance procedures, documents published by The Chlorine Institute will be purchased to supplement the maintenance information.  \n\nYou must establish a schedule for inspecting and testing equipment as"

A catastrophic release is one that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.  Exhibit 6-10 briefly summarizes the steps you must take for investigation incidents.  You should also consider investigating minor accidents or near misses because they may help you identify problems that could lead to more serious accident; however, you are not required to do so under part 68.    (6-29)\n\nThe Lancaster AWWTP will investigate all incidences that result in the release of chlorine within 48 hours.  All findings will be summarized in a report that will include the following information:\n\u00c2\u00b7  Factors contributing to the incident\n\u00c2\u00b7  Recommendation for corrective actions\n\nModifications, if applicable, will be made to the chlorination system and RMP to prevent further incidents.

A compliance audit is a way for you to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of your risk management program.  An audit reviews each of the prevention program elements to ensure that they are up-to-date and are being implemented and will help you identify problem areas and take corrective actions.

You must keep the two most recent audit reports, but you need not keep a report that is more than five years old.  You may also want to keep a record of who conducted the audit, but you are not required to do this. (6-27)\n\nThe Lancaster AWWTP will keep the two most recent audit reports within the prior five-year period.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIf you have at least one Program 2 or Program 3 at you facility, then part 68 may require you to implement an emergency response program, consisting of an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, employee training, and procedures to ensure the program is up-to-date.  This requirement applies if your employees will respond to some releases involving regulated substances. (8-1)\n\nWhat is a response?\n\nEPA interprets response to be consistent with the definition of response specified under OSHA's HAZWOPER Standard.  OSHA defines emergency response as a response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The key factor here is that responders are designated for such tasks by their employer.  This definition excludes responses to incidental releases of hazardous substances where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release are, or by maintenance personnel as well as responses to releases of hazardous substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard (i.e., fire, e"

Thus, if you expect your employees to take action to end a small leak (e.g., shutting a valve) or clean up a spill that does not pose an immediate safety or health hazard, this action could be considered an incidental response and you would not need to develop an emergency response program if your employees are limited to such activities. (8-2)\n\nDue to the fact that employees at the Lancaster AWWTP will only respond to small leaks that can be contained by shutting a valve, the AWWTP is not required to develop a full-blown Emergency Response Program in the RMP.\n\nUnder the RMP requirements, the AWWTP is required to coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\nCoordination with local responders entails the following steps:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7  Ensure that you have set up a way to notify emergency responders when there is a need.\n\u00c2\u00b7  If you have a covered process with a regulated toxic, work with the local emergency planning entity to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA regarding a response.\nThe Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Lancaster County is currently has an Off-Site Response Plan in place for the chlorination operation at the Lancaster WWTP.  This plan is updated each year by both the LEPC and the City of Lancaster."
