There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1995 and 1996, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plants with the assistance of a consulting organization. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific and issued to the plants. \n\nKey items included in the manual were:\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits; and\no Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations.\no Standard Operating Procedures for Chlorine Management\n\nThese manual were updated in 1999 to comply with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP). In 2001, the Wastewater Treatment Plant added Sulfur Dioxide to its process, a material regulated by RMP and PSM. Compliance documentation was updated to reflect this addition. A revised RMP was submitted to the EPA. \n\nTo maintain compliance with PSM and RMP a number of activities have been conducted on a scheduled basis including\n\no Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\no  Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes\n\no Conducting Self-Audit every three year \n\no An annual Review of Standard Operation Procedures and the Emergency Response Plan\n       \nThe supervisor, chief operator and several plant operators are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM regulation.\n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals\n\no The chlorine delivery systems at the plant"

This process has been proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine  \n                                                         \no Chlorine inventories are managed to maintain typically a maximum of seven cylinders on site at each plant.      \n                                                                                                                                                                 \nThe site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded. In 1997, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. Since this date, the ERP is annually reviewed and updated. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are being implemented on a routine basis. The next drill is scheduled for the 2005\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The Town has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. The Human Resource Manager for the Town also takes an active role in supporting the Utilities Safety Program. \n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n- Lockout/Tagout\n\n - Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plants have had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have no reportable chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases from the plants in the last five years.  The Town of Valde"
