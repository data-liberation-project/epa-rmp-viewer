The facility began operations in March 2008.    \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nNesika Energy, LLC has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nNesika Energy, LLC 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nNesika Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Scandia, Republic County, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from grain.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  Nesika Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored on site.\r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 211,692 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion. The entire contents of the tank are assumed to be pentane, even though this is a flammable mixture. This represents a worst-case release scenario.\r\n\r\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the denaturant tank. Residential homes are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\r\n\r\nAlthough Nesika Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage pot"

      "SummaryText": "ential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Process Safety Management (PSM) and associated Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed for this facility. Due to the amount of onsite regulated substances, there has been limited need for Management of Change (MOC) The MOC program was last reviewed in March 2017.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nNesika Energy, LLC constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on site. There have been no accidents that have released any RMP substances since the establishment of Nesika Energy, LLC.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nNesika Energy, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan. A SPCC was prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes and includes spill prevention and response measures for denaturant, an RMP substance.\r\n\r\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  Nesika Energy, LLC 's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
