The processes conducted at the City of Orange, Meeks Road Production Plant are the disinfection of water with chlorine and iron sequestration. U.S. EPA regulation 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, requires The City of Orange, Meeks Road Production Plant to comply with the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule because the quantity of chlorine stored on-site exceeds threshold quantities.  Iron sequestration does not involve any chemicals regulated by the RMP rule.\n\nThe RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit inventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA approved chemical release prevention program. In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP covered facilities to update its Risk Management Program Plan (RMP Plan) every five (5) years or six (6) months after an RMP reportable incident. This is the initial plan of the RMP Plan for the City of Orange, Meeks Road Production Plant. In compliance with 40 CFR 68, the City of Orange, Meeks Road Production Plant is submitting this five (5) year update to the plan initially submitted in June 1999. \n\nEPA has revised the RMP Plan rule so that the analysis of potential off-site consequences of a hypothetical Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Releases Scenario (ARS) are no longer required to be reported in the Executive Summary.  Therefore, the results are not reported in the Executive Summary although a WCS and ARS were conducted using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines. The scenarios for the City of Orange, Meeks Road Production Plant were calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp Modeling Program.

A summary of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the City of Orange, Meeks Road Street Production Plant is provided in the RMP Plan.  In both scenarios, although numerous controls are in place to prevent chemical releases and manage such consequences in the event of an incident, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the release scenarios.\n\nThe City of Orange Water/Sewer Department has implemented all the elements of a Program 2 Federal Risk Management Plan and is in full compliance with 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions."
