Especially in the areas of worker safety, environmental protection and production.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nMaple Leaf Farms, Inc. has developed a Crisis Management Team to prepare for any emergency which may occur at any of the Maple Leaf Farms facilities.  Maple Leaf Farms Inc. is committed to protect their employees and the people of the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nThe Maple Leaf Farms, Inc. Executive Board is committed to making Maple Leaf Farms the safest and best processing plant in Indiana and have given the plant manager the authority to purchase the equipment and training required to maintain a Maple Leaf Farms/Serenade Foods Emergency Response Team.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nMaple Leaf Farms Processing Plant is located at 9166 N 200 E. which places the processing plant 700 ft from the intersection of 900 N. & 200 E.  The facility consists of a main office building with 2 building complexes behind it and to the north of the main plant.  The main processing plant processes approximately 500,000 ducks per month as whole body ducks or as parts for further processing or sale.  The only regulated chemical used by Maple Leaf Farms is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  There is approximately 18,000 lbs of ammonia within the system. \n\n\n\nAs a part of our prevention plan we have performed a worst case and alternate release scenario centered around the possibility of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nMaple Leaf Farms has in place a Process Safety Management / Risk Program.  As a result of the PSM / RMP Program the following procedures and policies have been put into place:\n\n     Employee Participation Guidelines\n\n     Employee Training\n\n     Contractor Qualification Guidelines\n\n     Pre-Startup Procedu"

Any problems are addressed and repaired as needed.\n\n\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nMaple Leaf Farms has not had a reportable release in excess of 100 lbs of ammonia in the last 15 years.\n\n\n\nMaple Leaf Farms and Serenade Foods have developed a joint emergency response team to deal with any accidental release of ammonia into the environment.  The team has been trained and equipment has been ordered to enable the team to set up a mobile command center which will contain the P & ID drawings for both facilities, communication equipment, decontamination equipment, tools, level A suits, SCBAS, & all emergency phone numbers.  We will be having drills twice yearly to familiarize the team with the equipment and procedures to be followed.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nMaple Leaf Farms can only continue to be the number one processor of duck in the world if the Executive Group continue to support the current Process Safety Management Program which is in place. This allows are PSM / RMP team to have the freedom to make necessary improvements as they are identified.\n\n"
