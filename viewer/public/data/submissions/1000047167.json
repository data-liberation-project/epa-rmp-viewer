Once in the storage tank, Branch personnel manage the anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is then transferred to either the 10-34-0 Reacting process or to nurse tanks.  (This Facility does not own or operate nurse tanks.  However, other Helena Chemical Company retail Branch that are located close to Huntington, IN transport their nurse tanks to the Huntington, IN Facility, fill the nurse tanks, and sell the anhydrous ammonia in the nurse tank to the end user [e.g. Farmer].)  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia to the 10-34-0 manufacturing process or to the nurse tanks is conducted by Facility Process Operators from Huntington or HCC personnel from the nearby Facility, in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nProcess 2:  10-34-0 Manufacturing.  The facility will manufacture liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer (i.e. 10-34-0 Fertilizer) using a Stationary Pipe Reactor (SPR).  The ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid in the SPR.  The resulting ammonium polyphosphate solution is blended with water and discharged to a \"wet well.\" Once in the wet well, the product is cooled in a packed tower heat exchanger.  The product is then further cooled in a non-contact heat exchanger while at the same time vaporizing the liquid ammonia that is an input to the SPR.  The anhydrous ammonia used in the process may will be stored in the stationary storage tank (see Process 1). Trained Process Operators operate and maintain the SPR in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.  \r\n\r\nProcess 3:  Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling.  Aqua ammonia is primarily off-loaded from 9,000-gallon commercial tanker trucks and into a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank by the commercial truck operator (Contractor/Vendor).

The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  For covered processes 1 and 2, the largest vessel would be a 30,000-gallon storage tank containing anhydrous ammonia.  For Processes 3 and 4, the largest vessel would be a 30,000-gallon storage tank containing aqua ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.  The anhydrous ammonia release assumes that the entire contents of the tank are released instantaneously into the containment.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a transfer hose failure.  The alternative scenario for Covered Processes 2 assumes a rupture of a 3-inch transfer line.    The alternative scenario for Covered Process 3 assumes a transfer hose failure.  The alternative scenario for Covered Processes 4 assumes a rupture of a transfer line at a location where the transfer line is outside the containment.

The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to one or more Branch in Huntington, IN.  At this Facility, Helena engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of fertilizers, most of who use Helena's products to support agricultural Branch (See Section 3.0).  \r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Huntington Facility located approximately 1.75 miles east-northeast of Huntington at 104 Beaty Drive, Huntington, IN 46750.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Huntington Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Huntington Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is deleting the railcar storage process in the current RMP and adding 2 aqua ammonia processes.\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Huntington, IN Facility operates fertilizer blending and distribution equipment at its Facility and sells fertilizer products to farms and other distributors.

The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for assuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.  Note that PSM/RMP Program Document includes all elements of a Program 3 process for Processes 3 and 4 even though these two processes are Program 2 due to the concentration of aqua ammonia in the process.  This was done for the sake of management consistency for all the covered processes at the facility.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHelena's Huntington Facility is a non-responding facility.
