The PSM/RMPr includes all Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits. Equipment associated with this covered process may eventually include three 30,000-gallon stationary storage tanks, ancillary pumps, piping, and valves.  (There is only one tank currently present at the Facility).  From the stationary storage tanks, the anhydrous ammonia is either transferred to the 10-34-0 fertilizer manufacturing process, or to nurse tanks.  The Huntington Facility is responsible for the transfer of anhydrous ammonia and for the operations of the stationary pipe reactor in accordance with the PSM/RMPr.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia may be transported to the Facility by a 9,000-gallon commercial tanker truck.  The commercial tanker truck (Vendor) Operator will transfer the anhydrous ammonia from its tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation, maintenance, and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan to its vendor for review and a copy of its PSM/RMPr Document upon request.\n\n",

The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to one or more Branch in Huntington, IN.  At this Facility, Helena engages in the formulation, distribution and sale of fertilizers, most of who use Helena's products to support agricultural Branch (See Section 3.0).  \n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Huntington Facility located approximately 1.75 miles east-northeast of Huntington at 104 Beaty Drive, Huntington, IN 46750.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Huntington Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Huntington Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is deleting the railcar storage process in the current RMP and adding 2 aqua ammonia processes.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Huntington, IN Facility operates fertilizer blending and distribution equipment at its Facility and sells fertilizer products to farms and other distributors.  The Huntington Facility intends to operate the following four covered processes:\n\n    \n\nProcess 1:  Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Handling.  Anhydrous ammonia is primarily off-loaded from 9,000-gallon commercial tanker trucks and into a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The Facility currently has only one 30,000-gallon storage tank but plans to construct up to two more 30,000-gallon storage tanks at "

However, other Helena Chemical Company retail Branch that are located close to Huntington, IN transport their nurse tanks to the Huntington, IN Facility, fill the nurse tanks, and sell the anhydrous ammonia in the nurse tank to the end user [e.g. Farmer].)  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia to the 10-34-0 manufacturing process or to the nurse tanks is conducted by Facility Process Operators from Huntington or HCC personnel from the nearby Facility, in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nProcess 2:  10-34-0 Manufacturing.  The facility will manufacture liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer (i.e. 10-34-0 Fertilizer) using a Stationary Pipe Reactor (SPR).  The ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer is manufactured by blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid in the SPR.  The resulting ammonium polyphosphate solution is blended with water and discharged to a \"wet well.\" Once in the wet well, the product is cooled in a packed tower heat exchanger.  The product is then further cooled in a non-contact heat exchanger while at the same time vaporizing the liquid ammonia that is an input to the SPR.  The anhydrous ammonia used in the process may will be stored in the stationary storage tank (see Process 1). Trained Process Operators operate and maintain the SPR in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nProcess 3:  Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling.  Aqua ammonia is primarily off-loaded from 9,000-gallon commercial tanker trucks and into a 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank by the commercial truck operator (Contractor/Vendor).  The Facility currently"

The aqua-ammonia is then transferred to two blenders to make fertilizer micronutrients.  The transfer of aqua ammonia to the micronutrient formulation process is conducted by Facility Process Operators in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess 4:  Micronutrient Formulation.  Aqua ammonia is transferred from the 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank to one of two blenders along with water and other ingredients.  The transfer of aqua ammonia to the blending process is conducted by Facility Process Operators in accordance with the PSM/RMPr accident prevention program\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for each covered processes. The worst case scenario release assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  For covered processes 1 and 2, the largest vessel would be a 30,000-gallon storage tank containing anhydrous ammonia.  For Processes 3 and 4, the largest vessel would be a 30,000-gallon storage tank containing aqua ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.  The anhydrous ammonia release assumes that the entire contents of the tank are released instantaneously into the containment.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario for Covered Process 1 assumes a transfer hose failure.  The alternative scenario for Covered Processes 2 assumes a rupture of a 3-inch transfer line.    The alternative scenario for Covered Process 3 assumes a transfer hose failure.  The alternative scenario for Covered Processes 4 assumes a rupture of a transfer line at a location where the transfer line is outside the containment.  Although these events are classified as alternative scen"

The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for assuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements: Management System, Employee Participation, Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Maintenance, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Compliance Audits.  Note that PSM/RMP Program Document includes all elements of a Program 3 process for Processes 3 and 4 even though these two processes are Program 2 due to the concentration of aqua ammonia in the process.  This was done for the sake of management consistency for all the covered processes at the facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Huntington Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia Branch at the Huntington Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Huntington Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
