The safety and health of all personnel are first priority. Accident prevention and safety constitute the basics for employee training at this facility.\n\nSYSCO, has established a plant safety program to identify and address hazards in the workplace, evacuation procedures, and accident prevention.\n\nOne part of the plant safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR Part 68. The facility's Director of Facility Maintenance is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, terrorist acts, and other types of catastrophic accidents. These programs are designed to prevent accidental injuries, fatalities and illnesses as well as prevention of property damage and off-site consequences.\n\nB:   Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThis facility operates a NAICS # 42249 (Grocery and related products) distribution warehouse at  10510 Evendale Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45241. A two stage ammonia refrigeration system is employed to maintain temperatures in the storage, holding freezer and shipping areas.\n\nThe facility operates a two stage ammonia refrigeration system which provides cooling for t"

The maximum inventory for this system is 15,000 # . An ammonia release from this system could pose a risk of off-site public impact due to the quantity of inventory, therefore this refrigeration system is subject to the program Level 3 requirements of EPA's RM program.\n\nIn the High stage ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia vapor is fed from the HPRU (high pressure re-circulator unit) receiver to the compressors where it is compressed and discharged to the condensing towers, where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and flows by gravity to the thermosyphon receiver vessel (TSV-1) and through a level control valve station is introduced into the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR-1) at a set controlled pressure. Another level control valve station feeds the sub-cooled ammonia to the LPRU, where it is pumped to the evaporators. This liquid absorbs heat from the processes and changes to a vapor and is returned to the LPRU and then to the compressors where the High Stage cycle starts again. Hot Gas from the High stage compressor discharge is used to defrost the low temp evaporators. High pressure liquid ammonia is used to cool the oil in the ammonia compressors thermosyphon oil cooling system. This liquid is supplied directly from the TS-1 vessel. The low stage system employs booster compressors that take ammonia vapor from the LPRU (Low pressure re-circulator Unit) and discharge into the HPRU. The LPRU, is fed sub-cooled liquid ammonia from the HPRU through a level control valve station. These compressors employ liquid injection oil cooling which is supplied by liquid from the CPR vessel.\n\nC:   Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenario's.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia \nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves the release of  6,090 #  of ammonia over a ten minute period, due to a fa"
