Anhydrous ammonia is utilized at the Griffith Energy facility in the chiller system. Liquid ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the system that enhances gas turbine performance and efficiency during warm weather conditions by cooling the turbine inlet air. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators and compressors that comprise the chiller system. All equipment used within the chiller system has been designed and constructed under codes and standards regulated by the ammonia industry.\n\nChiller System Prevention Program Safety\n\nGriffith Energy maintains compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 CFR 68, CAA Section 112 EPA Risk Management Program.\n\nIn addition to the required OSHA, EPA and corporate safety programs that are mandated within the facility, the following engineering and administrative controls will be in place to eliminate, or reduce the possibility of an accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the Griffith Energy facility:\n\nA?Computer Control System monitors and controls compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps.

The results are retained on file at the Griffith Energy facility.\n\nGriffith Energy had one reportable release over the last five years (5/8/2007). There were no on or off site impacts associated with the release.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nGriffith Energy's emergency plan is part of the overall facility Integrated Contingency Plan which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. \n\nProcedures have been developed for: \n\n1) Pre-emergency planning and coordination; \n2) Personnel roles and lines of authority; \n3) Training; \n4) Communication; \n5) Emergency recognition and prevention; \n6) Safe distances and places of refuge; \n7) Site security and control; \n8) Emergency alerting and response; \n9) Personal protective and emergency equipment; and \n10) Medical surveillance. \n\nAll emergency response personnel undergo required training.
