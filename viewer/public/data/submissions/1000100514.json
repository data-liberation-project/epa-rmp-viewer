The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in adsorbers. The pure hydrogen is compressed and delivered to customers via our underground pipeline network. \r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps: The facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes. \r\n4. Five-year accident history: There have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n5. The emergency response program: The facility emergency response program is based upon OSHA HAZWOPER Standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. They have been trained to OSHA First Responder Awareness Level. The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Torrance Refinery Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process. Periodic drills are conducted with agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \r\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: The facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: At this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen . Hydrogen, methane, ethane, and propane in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant. Our emergency response program is based upon OSHA HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases. This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation. \r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled: The regulated substances handled at this facility are the flammable gas mixture consisting of hydrogen, methane, ethane, and propane. The primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen is used by our refinery customers to manufacture clean fuels. Hydrocarbon based gases (including natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock. The feed stock is compressed and cracked in our reformer (furnace). By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately"
