      "SummaryText": "Capital Resin Corporation (CRC) believes in a proactive, integrated approach to Accidental Release Prevention. Our program integrates ongoing upgrades in periodic maintenance scheduling, ISO documentation, and Process Safety Management.\n\nCRC personnel receive initial training in emergency response plans and policy during new employee orientation, and hands on training annually. Contracts are in place with local response companies to insure immediate service should contingencies occur that exceeds the capabilities of CRC equipment and personnel.\n\nCRC processes covered by the Risk Management program include our formaldehyde manufacturing plant and associated storage tanks and load racks as well as a batch reactor used to mix vinyl acetate monomer. The regulated substances (per 68.130) are formaldehyde solution (CAS 50-00-0) and vinyl acetate (CAS 108-05-4). As the attached Risk Management Plan details, our worse case scenario involved the complete failure of one of the formaldehyde storage tanks or the complete failure of a tank trailer of vinyl acetate.  While the chances of this occurring are extremely unlikely, analysis of this scenario was required under the RMP rule. Any leak or failure in the formaldehyde storage system would be contained by the dike system around the tanks. Any leak or failure in the vinyl acetate unload system would be contained by the trailer dike system.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention is integrated with all aspects of CRC operations. Process safety information contained in each Formaldehyde Operators Manual, Resin Operators Manual and MSDS data. Training provides intensive hands-on knowledge of the production processes. CRC documents training on each of the required areas. Written operating procedures are documented and controlled through CRC ISO 9001 program. Operating Procedures are reviewed and a written test is administered in the formal training sessions.\n\nEach employee involved in operating Formaldehyde Plant, Tanks, or Load rack is tr"

      "SummaryText": "ained in an overview of the process and familiarization with the operating procedures described previously. Each employee involved in operating batch reactors in the Reactive Plant, Tanks, or trailer loading and unloading is trained in an overview of the process and familiarization with the operating procedures described previously. The training emphasizes safe operation of the plant and associated systems.  Several weeks of on-the-job training emphasizes job tasks, safety and health hazards, normal and emergency operations, and safe work practices. \n\nCRC controls and tracks periodic maintenance requirements and ensures mechanical integrity of its processes. Under this program, we perform representative sampling and inspection of formaldehyde tank and batch reactor vessel structure for corrosion and integrity. CRC has Management of Change and Pre-Start-up Review programs implemented under PSM and administered for this  process."
