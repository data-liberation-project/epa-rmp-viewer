We try to provide the best service to our customers in the safest and most reliable manner.\n\nNow we are taking safety one step further by developing a comprehensive Risk Management Plan for our facility.  We will share the plan with local officials and the public.\n\nThe purpose of our Risk Management Plan, as required by the EPA, is to identify, report and communicate potential accidental releases of chlorine  stored and utilized at our site.  Since we store more than 2500 pounds of chlorine at this facility, we must submit a Risk Management Plan to the EPA by June 21, 1999.\n\nOur hazard assessment, accident prevention and emergency response are important to you and our community.  We know you will want to be a part of developing our plan and communicating it.

And, chlorine is also essential for the manufacture of the polyvinyl chloride we need for the safe packaging and storage of meat and perishable food products.\n\nCleaning:\nChlorine is used to make a wide variety of surface disinfectants and cleaning products for household and hospital use as well as for restaurant sanitation, food processing and many other industrial applications.\n\n \nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\nA hazard assessment is primarily an evaluation of the off-site consequences of potential release scenarios -- this is something that has not been done before.  \n\nKeep in mind that the hazard assessments are tools for the community to use for emergency planning purposes.  In that context, they will provide helpful information for fire and police agencies to better understand and plan for potential emergencies.\n\nThe assessments that are undertaken use computer models, recommended by EPA, to determine the impact of potential releases of hazardous chemicals.  Again, these are hypothetical situations to be used for planning purposes.  \n\nThe first element of the hazard assessment is what is called a worst case scenario.\n\nThis worst case scenarios is an estimate of the impact of a major catastrophic release on the surrounding community.  They are based on computer models or information provided in EPA tables.  \n\nTo help emergency planners have a full picture of the risks from chemical releases, the rule requires you to assume that there are absolutely no safeguards in place to respond to or prevent the release.  It also requires you to assume very stable weather conditions.  \n\nAgain, the purpose here is to paint a picture of what might happen for planning purposes.  It in no way is meant to predict what would actually happen.  It simply gives an indication of what may happen so that emergency planners c"

Once the containment vessel is breached, the fire must then get the lead plug hot enough for it to melt.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n **  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nTo add even more information for emergency planning purposes, the rule requires the development of more realistic scenarios.  \n\nThese assessments allow you to make assumptions that make the scenario more likely to reflect an actual situation.  For example, in the computer model, you can factor in emergency response safeguards, as well as reflect more realistic weather patterns for the area.  \n\nUsing this information, emergency planners are able to understand more clearly what could happen if an accidental chemical release occurred.  \n\nA chlorine feed line is ruptured.\n\nChlorine gas is released for a period of ten minutes.\n\nThe distance to the end-point of 3 parts per million ( considered a safe level)  is .3 miles shown on following model.\n\nAgain, inhalation or breathing may become difficult before the fumes reach 3 parts per million.\n\n \n\n\n \nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\n\nThe Longview Regional Water Treatment Plant is in the process of converting from our present chlorine storage system to two (2) total containment vessels in operation with nitrogen pressure to seal in chlorine in the event of a leak.

Based on the seriousness of the incident, there are a number of actions that might be taken.  \n\nFor example, the Incident Commander may initiate traffic control measures to limit access to the danger area.  This could include blocking of roads or highways.  \n\nThe Incident Commander will also make sure that all agencies, including the Washington State Department of Ecology, the Cowlitz County Department of Emergency Management, fire fighters and police, are kept in the communications loop.  \n\nThere are other actions the Incident Commander might take.  In an extreme emergency, it may be necessary to evacuate a certain area that is in the path of a release, assuming there is adequate time available to complete the evacuation.  Also, shelter in place may be ordered if there is no time for evacuation.  \n\n EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nWHAT TO DO\nSHELTER-IN-PLACE\n\n\nShelter in place covers one action an individual or family may need to take in the event of a chemical emergency.\n\nIn general, barring different instructions, the best thing for an individual or family to do is to shelter in place.  The key elements of this strategy are:  \n\n7 Going indoors\n7 Closing windows and doors\n7 Turning off outside air sources, such as air conditioners and furnaces\n7 Turning on the radio or television for information, and\n7 Avoiding the use of the phone.  \n\n\nSince chlorine is heavier than air, in the event of a chlorine release, go to the higher floors of your home.  \n\n \nCOMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\nIn terms of understanding community emergency preparedness, the Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC is an important player.  This local group was established by federal law to develop and implement local emergency response plans for chemical emergencies.  \n\n*  It is a county-wide organization made up of:\n\n\tAgencies charged with responding to emergencies, \n\tIndustrie"
