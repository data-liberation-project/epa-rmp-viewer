In conclusion to our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Air Liquide's Dallas Chemical Center location plans to:\n\n\n\n1.  Replace HCL piping on third floor of manufacturing with double contained PFA tubing. \n\n2.  Identify HCL offloading hoses with tags.\n\n3.  Consider HCL sensor in the clean room plenum area.\n\n4.  Add hooking up city water to the humphrey box in the standard operating procedure.\n\n"
