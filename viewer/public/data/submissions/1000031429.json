The Dallas Chemical Center is assisted by the Air Liquide Electronics US LP HAZMAT team.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nAs is our policy at Air Liquide, we continue to audit our process(es) for possibilities of improvement to process, operational methods, and new technology to lower risk. In conclusion to our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Air Liquide's Dallas Chemical Center location plans to:\r\n\r\n1.  Replace HCL piping on third floor of manufacturing with double contained PFA tubing. \r\n2.  Identify HCL offloading hoses with tags.\r\n3.  Consider HCL sensor in the clean room plenum area.\r\n4.  Add hooking up city water to the humphrey box in the standard operating procedure."
