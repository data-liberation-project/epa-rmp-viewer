It is recognized that while chlorine is an indispensable part of public health protection, it poses significant hazards if not handled properly.  The City of Winfield will abide by all pertinent EPA RMP regulations to guard against accidental releases of chlorine at the water treatment plant, and, if they do occur, to minimized their harm to the surrounding community and environment.  Additionally, the City of Winfield will always \"be on the look out\" for more efficient, safer methods of handling chlorine and, as circumstances and budget allow, for a less toxic alternative disinfection regime (i.e., ozone, etc.).\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nStationary source:\n\nThe City of Winfield\nMunicipal Water Treatment Plant\nPhysical location: At north edge of city limits, = mile east of Winfield Pre-release Correctional Facility on College Street\nRegulated substance:\nChlorine\n\nWorst case release scenario\n\nScenario\nRelease of the contents of an entire one ton chlorine cylinder.\n\nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance affected by the release\n\nMost of the chlorine line is on a vacuum system, if there is a break in the line, the vacuum will minimize the escape of chlorine.\nIn the event of a release, the chlorinator(s) and/or entire water system will be shut off as needed.\nIn the event of a release, all access doors to the chlorine room will be closed.\nIn the event of a release, 911 will be notified immediately.
