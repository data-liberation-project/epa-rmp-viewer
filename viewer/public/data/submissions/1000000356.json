St. Marks Powder, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics and is part of the General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems Division.\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at St. Marks Powder:\n\nSt. Marks Powder's overall approach to chemical safety is to prevent incidents and respond effectively if incidents occur.  It is St. Marks Powder's policy to conduct safety reviews/investigations, which include accidental release prevention, whenever changes are made, incidents occur, or at least every five years.  It is St. Marks Powder's policy to maintain an on-site emergency response capability that includes fire and hazardous materials hazards mitigation.\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe facility maunfactures smokeless propellant for ammunition.  One of the steps of the production process uses nitric acid and oleum, also know as fuming sulfuric acid.  Both nitric acid and oleum are regulated substances under the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program involves:\n\n          Safety reviews of all new projects.\n          Safety reviews on all changes to existing manufacturing operations.\n          Safety reviews on all manufacturing operations at least every five years.\n          Investigation of all incidents as they occur.\n\nThe chemical-specific prevention steps include:\n\n          Specific material handling procedures are enforced to minimize the potential for release.\n          Operators are trained and tested for acid handling responsibilities.\n          Acid tanks and piping are constructed of stainless steel.\n          Acid tanks are tested annually to ensure adequate tank integrity.\n\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nSt. Marks Powder has had n"
