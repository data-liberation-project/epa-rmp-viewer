The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nPilkington North America (PNA) has incorporated many safety features in the sulfur dioxide system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. PNA considers three primary hazards for sulfur dioxide storage and use in plant operations. The primary concerns are over-pressurization, physical damage to the sulfur dioxide containers, and damage/deterioration to associated piping and tubing. Locating the sulfur dioxide containers in protected covered areas helps to mitigate the potential for over-pressurization that may be caused by exposure to direct sunlight.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide containers are protected from vehicle traffic by barriers and by their location. The potential for a significant release at the injection systems due to damage to connected tubing and piping is greatly minimized by the use of vacuum regulators at the cylinders. Additionally, flexible tubing used in the systems is replaced on a regular basis.\n\nIn additions to the physical features of the sulfur dioxide injection system at the facility, PNA has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system. Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been prepared for the sulfur dioxide system. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the system.\n\n2. Your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nPNA, 500 East Louise Avenue in Lathrop, California, is located in an area zoned for commercial and industrial use. The facility is near Interstate 5, which runs north-south through Lathrop. PNA manufactures various glass products at the plant.\n\nThere is one sulfur dioxi"

      "SummaryText": "de process at PNA. Sulfur dioxide is used in the manufacture of float glass at the facility. A central control room system monitors the system. The desired flow of sulfur dioxide is controlled with manually and electrically operated valves. The largest sulfur dioxide vessel at the plant has a capacity of approximately 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide injection system consists of a pressurized container of liquid and gaseous sulfur dioxide. Injectors provide a sulfur dioxide/air mixture for use in the manufacturing of glass products. A regulator is connected to the sulfur dioxide containers, and a high-pressure hose connects the regulator to a metering system and process equipment. A metering system controls the volume of sulfur dioxide that is injected.\n\n3. The Worst-case release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances:\n\nThe worst-case sulfur dioxide release was the entire contents of the largest vessel (2000 lbs.) released in 10 min. resulting from a total failure of the container. The release scenario was projected in a stability class F with a distance to the endpoint being 0.9 miles. The estimated population of 5996 in the vulnerability area would include schools, residences, hospitals and major commercial, office and industrial areas. Administrative controls and mitigation measures were not considered to limit the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe alternate sulfur dioxide release was a pipe leak failure releasing 600 lbs. in 30 minutes. The release scenario was projected in a stability class D with a distance to the endpoint being 0.1 mile. The estimated population of 121 in the vulnerability area would include, residences, and major commercial, office and industrial areas. Administrative controls and mitigation measures were not considered to limit the distance to the endpoint.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention"

      "SummaryText": " Steps:\n\nPNA performs classroom training, competence testing to enhance employee?s understanding of the importance of handling the chemicals safely and improve employee?s chemical handling skills.\n\n5. The Five -Year Accident History:\n\nThere have not been any accidents at the facility involving this process that has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or offsite in the last 5 years.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe emergency response program is coordinated with the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services and the local fire department. A hazardous Materials Management Plan is reviewed annually so that responders have the most current information on facility contacts, training programs and spill response information i.e. public notification, alert systems, etc.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPNA plans to move the sulfur dioxide control panel outside of the main building so that a leak in the control panel (piping/valves) will not affect employees working in the building."
