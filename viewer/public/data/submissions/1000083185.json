Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at XPO (Jacobson Companies doing business as XPO Logistics Supply Chain Inc.) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were to occur, emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of a release.  Our site specific Emergency Action Plan includes the steps and sequence of steps to be taken including appropriate contacts to make.  We are contracted with a third party chemical incident mitigation company to assist us should any release escape into the environment as necessary.  We are also coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response capabilities.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are comprised of the receipt, storage and shipment of hazardous materials in DOT approved packaged form for our customers.  We currently have two reportable substances at the facility included in this plan.  They are ethyl ether and formaldehyde.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has developed and implemented a prevention program to prevent accidental releases of regulated material.  This program includes the following elements:  Safety examination, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance and internal compliance audits.\n\n\n\n4.  The 5 Year Accident History\n\nThis site has had no reportable accidents during the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility has a documented Emergency Action Plan that includes dealing with accidental releases of hazardous materials (incidental releases only).  Employees are trained on this plan and the training is documented.  The Emergency Action P"

Any items needing corrective actions are documented and corrective actions put in place by the site Operations Manager.  Confirmation of the corrective actions being put in place is done by the Regional Operations Manager.   \n\n\n\nAdditional Information: The quantity released for the Worst Case Scenario & Alternative Scenario for formaldehyde represents the percent of the toxic chemical in solution and not the entire mixture."
