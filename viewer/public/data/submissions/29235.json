This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of polyurethane systems.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-].  Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] is used for production of polyurethane systems.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used PHAST.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have also employed PHAST .  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nTDI Storage qualifies as a program level 1 process.  In the worst case scenario for this process 45000 lb. of Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a  pool from which evaporation takes place. Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of containing the entire release quantity and limiting the size of the pool formed by the release.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, t"

This distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario for the TDI Storage process, 18345 lb. of Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a  pool from which evaporation takes place. Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of containing the entire release quantity and limiting the size of the pool formed by the release.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.016 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L.  This distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with API / ASME Specifications, Southern Building Code, and Corporate Standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Dow Chemical Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis Reviews, Layer of Protection Analysis Reviews, and other reviews.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qu"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 3/27/2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Dow Chemical Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Dow Chemical Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at The Dow Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 11/20/2003.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks"

The most recent review was performed on 10/27/2003.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Dow Chemical Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 3/10/2003.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Dow Chemical Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Dow Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nThe Dow Chemical Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nThe Dow Chemical Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  These findings will be reviewed and prioritized by the facility safety committee.  The initial review and prioritization process is expected to be implemented by 2/15/2004, and appropriate timelines to implement actions determined from the review will be established."
