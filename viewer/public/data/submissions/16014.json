THE PLANT IS DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED WITH STRICT ADHERANCE TO ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR FACILITIES EACH YEAR AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD RELEASE A TOTAL OF 131,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.1 MILES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 60 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF A TYPICAL AMMONIA PLANT.  THEY ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFEY WATER IS ALWAYS PRESENT DURING THE AMMONIA OPERATION.\n\nTHIS COMPANY, BECAUSE OF ITS TRAINING PROGRAM CAN BOAST OF NO INJURY ACCIDENTS AND OR ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED AND DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'VE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENTAL TOXIC RELEASE OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATION WHICH MAY EXIST.  TOURS ARE GIVEN TO LOCAL FIREMAN TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
