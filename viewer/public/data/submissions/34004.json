This section, commonly referred to as the \"Risk Management Plan\" or RMP, is designed to both prevent and prepare for releases of chemicals or flammable substances that would have an impact on the surrounding public.  The Bhopal, India release of methyl isocyanate  is an example of such a catastrophic event.  Under the regulation certain facilities would be required to submit a RMP that summarizes their Risk Management Program to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  USAAVNC and Fort Rucker store/use toxic chemical and flammable substances in quantities meeting the rule's thresholds and are therefore required to develop a risk management program and submit a risk management plan to the EPA.  \n     Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are available at the Installation.  For security reasons, areas of concern are not listed in this executive summary.\n         We are in compliance with OSHA PSM rules.  We have not had any significant accidental releases involving extremely hazardous substances (EHS) in the last five years.  Our Emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local community plan and joint training drills with the local fire department are conducted.\n     The Clean Air Act Risk Management Program at Fort Rucker is designed to help insure that catastrophic releases of EHS's will not occur.  This is done via the development and implementation of a comprehensive program to manage chemical process risk.  Key participants in this program include the Fort Rucker Environmental Quality Control Committee; the Directorate of Engineering and Logistics Environmental Division; Aviation Branch Safety Office; Preventive Medicine (Industrial Hygiene); Directorate of Plans, Training, Mobilization, and Security; Staff Judge Advocate; American W"
