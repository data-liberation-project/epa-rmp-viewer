      "SummaryText": "Northland Cold Storage, Inc. is a cold storage warehousing facility located at 903 Grossmaan Drive, Schofield, WI. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to maintain temperatures in the coolers and freezers. This is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures ranging from a low of 0 lbs to a high of 165 lbs. Total system charge is estimated at 12,000 pounds. After reviewing our PSM progrm, it became evident to us that we needed to devote more time and effort into complying with the regulation and documenting the maintenance on our system. We have set a deadline of September 30, 1999 to have completed all elements satisfying both the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worst-case release is the failure of the largest vessel in our refrigeration system. This vessel is called the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) and has a maximum capacity of 9,400 pounds and is located in our compressor room. The compressor room measures 50' x 27' x 21' and has a total air volume of 28,350 cubic feet. Roof ventilation in this room produces approximately 17 room air exchanges per hour. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of  EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint was calculated at .70 miles. Based on census data provided by \"Landview III\", within this radius is a population of 340, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. No hospitals or schools are located within this area. \n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" reference tables and equations. A pressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided in the RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammonia at 400 lbs/min, from the High Pressure Receiver relief valve, would affect an area of .20 miles. The estimated population, according "

      "SummaryText": "to Landview III, within distance to endpoint is 115. There are also some residences, industrial and retail businesses. There are no schools or hospitals within this radius. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe have established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. We have also coordinated efforts with the Ashwaubenon Fire Department to establish a joint response program. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are\ncurrent and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nWe have trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Northlan Cold Storage has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a release. We have also purchased Level A and B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History: \nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nNorthland Cold Storage, Inc., to maintain t"
