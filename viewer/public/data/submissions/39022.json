      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan ? Executive Summary\n\nSouth Central Coop ? Lacona\nLacona, IA\n\nOur facility has taken measures to help reduce the risk of an accidental release.  This company is a full service farm supply company with the greatest risk of release coming from our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.  This location has 5 bulk tanks and 18 nurse tanks.  This facility has the capacity to store 385,710 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The storage tanks are located on the South edge of the town of Lacona.  They are the 5 West tanks and the valves are located at the East end of the West tanks and the valves on the East 3 tanks are located on West end of the tanks.  The Nurse tank fill station is located on the North side of the tanks. \n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release in the amount of 79,000 pounds.  The release would be 7,900 pound per minute for 10 minutes.  Assuming a 1.5 m/sec wind speed, the distance to the endpoint would be 3.6 miles, affecting 564 people.  The alternate worst-case scenario would be a transfer hose failure.  The quantity released would be 11,908 pounds at a rate of 5,954 pounds per minute.  The release durations would be 2 minutes.  Assuming a 3 m/sec wind speed the distance to the endpoint would be .5 miles, affecting 15 people.\n\nWe have an accidental release prevention program in effect.  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with provision of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, Published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?. "

      "SummaryText": " The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 42-Rule 43.6(200).  ?Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?.  The OSHA Standard is referenced in the registration form Section 8.3b.  Additional accidental release prevention measures we utilize range from employee training to equipment maintenance.  We have excess flow valves, back check valves, and pressure relief valves on our ammonia system.  We also have gauges to tell us when these tanks are full to prevent the over filling of these tanks which in turn would create an accidental release.\n\nSafety is an ongoing process.  We inspect our plant on a regular basis and we review our safety policies throughout the year.  We are in the process of installing barriers to help prevent vehicular damage.  We have not had an accident within the last five years.  Our Emergency Response Program consists of a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  We also follow the Iowa Fertilizer Rule Standards and provide state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  We will notify the local authorities as well as the LEPC if a release occurs.  The number to call is 911 and (515) 961-6386 respectively.  Our role as the company will be to secure the area until local authorities arrive and assist them in any way possible.  This is our plan if an accidental release should occur."
