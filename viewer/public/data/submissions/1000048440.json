This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management / Risk Management Program / California Accidental Release Prevention programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local facility managers is responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nCostco personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, the Director of Maintenance and Engineering and/or their supervisor. The Director of Maintenance and Engineering and/or supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility processes ground beef and hot dogs and produces several packaged meat products that are sold in Costco Wholesale warehouses worldwide.  The facility is located at 17880 W. Schulte Road in Tracy, California.  The ammonia refrigeration system was commissioned in 2005 and was built in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility's ammonia re"

The majority of the system is located in the Meat Plant and Hot Dog engine rooms including the vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roofs and all of the evaporators and process freezers are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility's ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the Costco facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Trained operators at the facility are responsible for routine maintenance of the refrigeration system including completing daily log sheets, visual inspections, etc.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are utilized for periodic major maintenance and repairs of the ammonia equipment.  Records are kept for work performed in-house and by refrigeration contractors. \n\n\n\nThe Costco facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the engine rooms and the cold storage/process areas and automatic safety shut down mechanisms for the compressors.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just outside of the engine rooms (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that protect the integrity of the equipment in the event of a high pressure situation.  These pressure relief valves are tied into a common header that vents into two water diffusion tanks to"

The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco has developed a preventive maintenance program that outlines regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \n\n\n\n- On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\" \n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the PHA Revalidation study performed on December 2-4, 2014, revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia over the previous five years (December 2009 - December 2014) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in 24 hours or that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History or that meet the state requirement mandating reporting of any releases or threatened releases. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of ammonia, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility has an emergency response plan in effect.

To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility has a trained Emergency Response Team onsite that responds to emergency situations, including chemical releases. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Costco facility has worked to address safety issues in an effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A PHA Revalidation study was completed in December 2014 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  Costco is proceeding with the mitigation measures associated with this study.\n\n\n\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM/RMP/CalARP programs at each of the facilities to ensure on-going compliance with the Process Safety Management, Risk Management Program, and CalARP programs.
