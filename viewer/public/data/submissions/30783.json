The objective is to minimize the impact to Advanced Materials' employees, the public and the environment. This objective is met by continuing to utilize general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. Advanced Materials' manangement is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nMorton International Advanced Materials is located in Weeks Island, LA and operate primarily as a manufacturer of speciality chemicals. Two chemicals, MTS and H2Se, are utilized at the facility in sufficiant quantities to be subject to the RMP requirements as detailed at 40 CFR Part 68. Another chemical H2S which is regarded as being potentially harmful is also used at the facility. This compound, as well as those regarded by the RMP are handled and stored using the best management practices, including specially \ndesigned collectors, cylinders, or bulk tank.\n\nConsequence Analysis\n\nThe accidental Release Prevention Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated chemicals under well-defined conditions. Two types of releases must be considered; first, a \"worst case\" must be examined and secondly, a release that is more likely to occur. These incidents are known as the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nThe regulations require that the worst case consider the effects of the rupture of a vessel (or pipe) that contains the maximum amount of the chemical that is being examin"

      "SummaryText": "ed. The chemical is then presumed to evaporate (if released as a liquid) and dissipate as it moves away from the release site.\n\nThe regulation defines the conditions under which the evaporated material dissipates. Conservative assumptions are made regarding the temperature, wind speed and the tendency for \"mixing\" to occur in the atmosphere. The assumptions are used such that the predicted concentration of the chemical represents an over-estimate of what would actually occur.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is one that is considered to be more likely to oocur. The alternative release scenarios provided within this RMP have been developed considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g., hose leaks, seal failures, line ruptures) that have involved chemicals, items that have been identified through the \"What If\" process and those associated with the chemical industry in general. The RMP regulations provide the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario consequence analysis that was performed for each compound indicated that there is a potential for concentrations to exceed the endpoints defined by the regulations in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of MTS from the storage tank (defined by the RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact the surrounding community.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios that were developed for each chemical regulated under the RMP regulations indicated that the impact zone would be significantly reduced by the comparison to that predicted for the worst case release of MTS. Given that the alternative release scenarios represent events more likely to occur, the reduced impact area is one measure of the effectiveness of Advanced Materials' prevention program and mechanisms used to mitigate the results of an incident. Further, it should be noted that the likelihood of any of these scenarios occuring"

There have not been any release MTS from the Weeks Island, LA facility that has met the reporting criteria by causing injuries requiring medical treatment significant property damage, affects the public or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nMorton has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week. These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques (HAZWOPER).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMorton completes a thorough review of the potential impact of all chemicals that are considered for use at the facility. This includes compounds that are not specifically addressed under the RMP regulation. Further, Morton conducts reviews on a routine basis to ensure that each process that employs hazardous chemicals is thoroughly examined.\n\nThe Weeks Island facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequeces of a release to the employeesof the facility, the public and the environment. These regulations include:\n- 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n- 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n- 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n- 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in Morton's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, appropriate training of all employees, and ongoing communication and training with local responders.\n\nEmployee participation in the release preven"

Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for MTS and H2Se. Morton employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nMorton policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes. This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project. Morton maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\n\nMorton is committed to providing comprehensive safety training to all employees regarding safety procedures. Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility. In addition, Morton conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for. Members of Morton's emergencvy response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed. Annual training with local responders is part of this program."
