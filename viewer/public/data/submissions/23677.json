The first release scenario is the \r\ncase defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the \u00bfworst case\u00bf \r\nscenario.  This scenario assumes that the largest vessel is full and it releases the \r\nentire contents of the containers during a ten-minute period.  The second scenario \r\n(or alternative scenario) is based on a situation more likely to occur which will \r\ncause a release of chemicals at the facility.  The radius of impact was determined \r\nbased on the guidance provided in Chapter 4: \u00bfOffsite Consequence Analysis\u00bf of \r\nthe General Guidance for Risk Management Programs dated October 27, 1998 \r\nand the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk management Program for Water \r\nTreatment Plants.  The distance to the end point concentration was determined \r\nwith the aide of the Computer Program Aerial Locations of Hazardous \r\nAtmospheres, version 5.2.1 (ALOHA).  The National Safety Council developed \r\nthis program for emergency planners.  ALOHA works in conjunction with the \r\nComputer-Aided Management of Emergency Operations (CAMEO) database and \r\nMapping Operation for Response, Planning and Local Operational Task \r\n(MARPLOT) program.\r\n\r\nIn all release scenarios, the toxic end point concentration remained the same.  The \r\ntoxic end point for chlorine is three parts per million (ppm) or 0.0087 milligrams \r\nper liter (mg/l) which is the endpoint concentration published in the CFR Part 68.  \r\nThe American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has listed these \r\nconcentrations as the \u00bfmaximum airborne concentration\u00bf, at which nearly all \r\nindividuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or \r\ndeveloping life threatening health effects.  This level is referred to as the \r\nEmergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) concentration.  \r\n\r\nResults of the hazard analyses for the EPA \u00bfworst case\u00bf scenario led to an area \r\ndefined by a 2.6-mile radius for chlorine.

The population within the defined areas was estimated \r\nfrom the 1990 Census data entered in the Program Landview III.\r\n\r\nThe key to a successful risk management program is to first define hazard, risk \r\nand undertake a comprehensive approach to prevention.  The Center for Chemical \r\nProcess Safety has defined hazard as:\r\n\r\nA chemical or physical condition that has the potential for causing damage \r\nto people, property or the environment \r\n\r\nOnce hazards are identified on the site, then, an evaluation of the risk involved \r\nwill lead to a systematic identification, evaluation, and control of potential losses \r\nthat may arise in operation from future events such as fires, explosions, or toxic \r\nchemical releases.  The Water Treatment Plant will operate in accordance with the \r\nprocedures outlined in the plant\u00bfs Operation and Maintenance Manual.  The \r\nmanual sets forth inspections and maintenance requirements of the equipment.  \r\nThroughout this RMPlan, the emergency readiness procedures and regular \r\ntraining schedules are emphasized.  One of the goals of implementing these \r\nprocedures and schedules is to minimize the chance of a release occurring.  If the \r\nplant employees practice preventative maintenance and are well trained in \r\nemergency procedures, if a release occurs, they will be successful in preventing \r\nand minimizing personnel injury.\r\n\r\nAll employees who perform work at the water treatment facilities are required to \r\nknow the locations of the emergency telephone numbers and names of individuals \r\nto contact in case of a release.

This facility will produce drinking water for the Prattville Water \r\nWorks Board of the City of Prattville, Water Works Board of the City of \r\nWetumpka, Tri-Community Water System, City of Millbrook, and the Holtville \r\nWater System.  The facility is located at:\r\n\r\nFive Star Water Supply District\r\n251 Lakeview Drive\r\nWetumpka, AL   36092\r\n\r\nThis RMPlan has been developed to meet the standards published in the 40 Code \r\nof Federal Register (CFR) part 68.  In order to meet the accidental release \r\nprevention provision under the Clean Air Act \u00a7112(r)(7), the Environmental \r\nProtection Agency (EPA), promulgated these regulations.  The provisions require \r\nfacilities that exceed the cited threshold quantities for certain chemicals to \r\ndevelop a RMPlan.  The goal of a RMPlan is to focus on reducing the risk of \r\naccidental releases of certain chemicals; thereby, preventing harm to employees \r\nas well as potentially catastrophic impacts to the public.  Over 60 accidental \r\nreleases of regulated chemicals at water treatment plants (WTP\u00bfs) and wastewater \r\ntreatment facilities in the United States were reported between 1986 and 1995. \r\n\r\nChlorine is currently stored and/or used in the water treatment process at these \r\nfacilities and the quantities stored on site exceed the 2,500-pound threshold for \r\ncoverage under the RMP Program.  Currently, chlorine is delivered to the \r\nfacilities in 1-ton cylinders.  Typically, four, 2,000-pound cylinders are on-site.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the areas that could be impacted from a release of the \r\nchemicals into the atmosphere, a hazard analysis was conducted to determine the \r\noffsite consequences.  Two analyses were performed in order to estimate"
