Unsafe conditions must be reported.\r\n     By maintaining an effective environmental, health, and safety compliance program, the risk of personal injury, operational interruptions, and regulatory fines are reduced, and the mission of the Agency is manifested. The cooperation of all Agency employees is required.\r\n     Consistent with these principles, the Agency is committed to the safe design, administration, and operation of its facilities, and safe work practices of Agency employees and contractors. This includes the AgencyA\u00bfs continuing commitment to provide training in accident prevention and emergency response procedures to prevent or minimize the effects of an accidental chemical release. The Agency has and will continue to coordinate with local emergency response personnel in exercises designed to prepare each agency in the appropriate procedures to follow in the event of a chemical release emergency.\r\n\r\n(b.) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\r\n     Since its construction in 1980, the sole purpose of the Agency's Miners Ranch Water Treatment Plant has been to treat raw surface water to safe drinking water standards for distribution to the surrounding community. It is designed and operated as a secure facility with access restricted to a select number of Agency personnel, authorized contractors and vendors, and credentialed representatives of federal, state, and local agencies with designated regulatory authority over Agency operations. \r\n     The Agency finds beneficial the use of gaseous chlorine as the water treatment disinfectant of choice at the Miners Ranch Water Treatment Plant. Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Service Number 7782-50-5) is the most widely used disinfectant for treating drinking water in the United States and is typically the least expensive. At the Facility, this chemical is received in and used in the water disinfection process directly from one-ton containers. At any time, the maxim"

The properties that make chlorine so effective at water treatment disinfection also make it potentially dangerous if mishandled.\r\n     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers chlorine a regulated toxic substance and subject to chemical accident prevention regulations when present above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. The EPAA\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) provisions, as codified in 40 CFR Part 68, require owners or operators of stationary sources with covered processes to conduct a hazard assessment, develop and implement a management system, a prevention program, and an emergency response program to protect the public health and the environment from accidental releases. It also requires these sources to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA. \r\n     The federal Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) considers chlorine a highly hazardous chemical subject to the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation when present above the threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds. The OSHAA\u00bfs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119, requires employers of applicable facilities to prepare and implement a written Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to protect employees in the workplace from catastrophic releases.\r\n     The California Division of Occupational Safety & Health (DOSH) considers chlorine an acutely hazardous material subject to the Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials regulation when present above the threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds.

Topics include the required elements of the accidental release prevention program, operating procedures for the regulated process, chemical-specific bulletins by the Chlorine Institute, and equipment-specific pamphlets by equipment manufacturers. Contractors are evaluated thoroughly and provided appropriate training prior to work, and still then only work under the oversight of a Treatment Operator. \r\n     The other elements of the accidental release prevention program compliment well with several of the Agency's other environmental, health, and safety programs. Unique elements of the accidental release prevention program include maintenance according to specified procedures to ensure mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, and pre-startup safety review procedures. Existing programs that compliment the accidental release prevention program include the hot work safety program, near-miss and accident/incident investigation reporting program, and emergency planning and response plan.\r\n\r\n(d.) THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n     Due to the effective implementation of its accidental release prevention program and allied environmental, health, and safety compliance programs by its trained and vigilant staff, the Agency has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine from the regulated process at the Facility that meets the regulatory reporting criteria within the last five years.\r\n\r\n(e.) THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\n     The Agency has operated the Miners Ranch Water Treatment Plant safely and responsibly since its construction in 1980.

THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n     As components of its comprehensive environmental, health, and safety compliance program, the Agency has prepared and implemented a written accidental release prevention program (its CAP/PSM/Cal-ARP Program), this associated Risk Management Plan, and an Emergency Response Plan designed to reduce the risk of injury to employees, the public, and the environment from the accidental release of chemicals, and to comply with the regulations described above.\r\n     The Agency's accidental release prevention program emphas safe design, implementation of safe operating procedures by trained staff, and the complimentary integration of protective programs designed and implemented to minimize the potential for an accidental chemical release. With regards to safe design, the Facility's gaseous chlorine feed system operates on a vacuum injection process, recognized by the American Water Works Association as an inherently safer process than a pressurized gas feed process.

Personnel are trained that control of a chemical release is only to be attempted in the incipient stage. Trained personnel with the Butte County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Unit are to respond to an uncontrolled chemical release incident, with Agency staff to provide assistance to incident command outside of the exclusion zone. Due to this reliance, the Agency has and will continue to coordinate with local emergency response personnel in exercises designed to prepare each agency in the most appropriate procedures to follow in the event of a chemical release emergency.\r\n\r\n(f.) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n     The Agency considers its environmental, health, and safety compliance programs subject to continuous quality improvement. No significant changes are considered necessary to improve the current safety of the regulated process or operations. However, the Agency is in the in the engineering phase of a planed facility improvement project which will include the addition of a chlorine scrubber and seismic upgrades to the facility and covered process."
