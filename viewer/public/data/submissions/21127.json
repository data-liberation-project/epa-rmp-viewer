It is unloaded in a closed system using a compressor to remove the vapors from the larger storage vessel and pressurizing the rail car with this vapor.  The resultant differential pressure pushes the liquefied anhydrous ammonia to the storage vessel.  The maximum pressure in the anhydrous ammonia system during unloading and storage is 120 psig.  The operational pressure rating for the storage vessel is 250 psig.\nTransfers of anhydrous ammonia from the larger storage vessel to either aqueous ammonia production or the smaller storage vessel is via small transfer pumps.\nThe aqueous ammonia unit started production in May 1995.  Aqueous ammonia is produced by injecting a controlled volume of anhydrous ammonia in a recirculating flow of unfinished aqueous ammonia.   The batch production process is continued until the desired concentration of ammonia in the solution is reached.  The maximum batch size (limited by the working capacity of the production tank) is approximately 9,000 gallons.  Finished aqueous ammonia is stored in a 28,400 gallon working capacity tank.  Both of the aqueous ammonia vessels are located in a common containment structure.\nAmmonium sulfate has been produced in Searsport since 1949.  A new modern production unit went into service in October 1992.  The older unit was shutdown in August of that year.\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied to the ammonium sulfate process as a vapor.  The smaller anhydrous ammonia tank is coupled with a small vaporizer.  The combined units are maintained at a constant level to permit steady-state vaporization of the ammonia.  The maximum pressure in this anhydrous ammonia system during ammonium sulfate production is 120 psig.  The operational pressure ratings for both the smaller storage vessel and the vaporizer are 250 psig each.\nNo regulated waste ammonia, anhydrous or aqueous, is generated by any handling or processing at the Searsport facility"

No containment or passive mitigation was used.   The calculated impact radius is 6.9 miles.  The estimated population that may be impacted is 11,000.  A  catastrophic failure is extremely unlikely since it would require a structural failure of the stationary rail car or the impact and penetration of the vessel shell by some object of significant mass and/or velocity.  The rail cars are maintained (inspections, external coatings) by their owners to prevent external corrosion from the weather.  The anhydrous ammonia grade shipped to General Alum (includes trace quantities of  water) is not corrosive to the steel tank interior.  The possibility for an object piecing the rail car vessel is very unlikely due to the isolation of the anhydrous ammonia unloading location and the absence of other activities or traffic in the area.\nProcess 2:  Catastrophic failure of the aqueous ammonia (30% concentration) storage tank containing 212,200 pounds of solution (63,660 pounds of 100% ammonia).  The tank is located within a containment structure with a surface area 1424 square feet and a depth of 39 inches.  The calculated impact radius is 0.4 miles.

The last lost-time injury was nearly four years ago (October 4, 1995).\nThe facility is ISO 9002 certified.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nGeneral Alum & Chemical Corporation manufactures primarily inorganic chemicals at its Searsport facility.  With regards to 40 CFR Part 68, anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (>20% concentration) are handled and stored at quantities exceeding the threshold quantities.\nAnhydrous ammonia was first used at the site in 1956 with the startup of an anhydrous ammonia synthesis plant.  The facility included two 2000 ton refrigerated storage spheres.  This production unit operated until 1966 when it was shutdown due to business conditions.  The production facility was sold and dismantled in 1967.  One of the storage spheres was used for storage of refrigerated anhydrous ammonia until 1988 when its use for storage was discontinued.  The second sphere was maintained in serviceable condition for backup purposes only.  The spheres were dismantled and sold for scrap in 1994.\nAfter the use of the spheres for storage was discontinued, anhydrous ammonia was stored in smaller horizontal pressure vessels.  The larger vessel (16,700 gallon working capacity) is located in the ammonia receiving area while the smaller vessel (3,900 gallon working capacity) is located in the ammonium sulfate production area.\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to produce aqueous ammonia and ammonium sulfate.

The loading operation is done under the direct observation on an operator.  If a hose fitting were to come loose, the operator would be able to immediately stop the pump.  There is no pressure in the aqueous ammonia system that would permit the continuance of the flow of aqueous ammonia through the open hose after the pump stopped.  Since the beginning of the aqueous ammonia operation in 1995, there have no instances of a hose separation during the loading of tanker trucks.\nProcess 1/Alternate 3:  The release of ammonia  vapor via a faulty pressure relief valve on the larger anhydrous ammonia storage tank.

Before a hole or tear in the hose would occur, a blister or bubble on the surface of the hose would be visible to the operator.

The standard operating procedures (SOPs) are reviewed and updated whenever a operation change is made.  If no operational changes are made, the SOPs are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\nThe ISO 9002 program at General Alum requires rigid compliance to SOPs, preventive maintenance procedures, and instrument calibrations.  All procedures must be reviewed annually.  The ISO program is audited internally every year (audit components are distributed throughout the year) and recertified by a third party annually.\nMandatory monthly training sessions are attended by all production and maintenance employees.  The subjects include annual training of SOPs, hazards communications, fire safety, electrical safety, and pollution prevention.\nGeneral Alum supports a fully trained and equipped Hazmat Team to address incidents that may occur at the facility and in the transportation of product shipped from the facility.  Depending upon the circumstances of an on-site or transportation incident, a contract responder such as Clean Harbors may be  called-in for assistance.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia (vapor or liquid) or aqua ammonia in the last five years. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan for the facility was first published in April 1991.  It was completed reviewed and updated in February 1999.  The plan covers all the processes and chemicals handled at the facility.  The plan is coordinated with the Waldo County Emergency Management Agency and the Waldo County LEPC.
