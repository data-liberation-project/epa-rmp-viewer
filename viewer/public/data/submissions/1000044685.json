      "SummaryText": "Dead River Company (Dead River's) plans to operate a bulk liquid petroleum gas (propane) storage and distribution facility owned by Green Mountain Railroad Company (GMRC) at their property in Bellows Falls, Vermont.  The facility will be operated in compliance with the requirements of National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)-58, Liquefied Petroleum Gas storage, United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) 49 CFR 174, and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Hampden, ME location that is for use at any location during emergencies, however because of the great distance from that location Dead River has worked with the Bellows Falls Fire Department so that they can assist in emergency response. Dead River has an outreach program to offer propane fire training burns during the summer months and instructional training to local fire departments for the purpose of educating fire departments about the hazards of propane.\n\nThe Bellows Falls facility is a rail-access bulk terminal storing propane (LPG) for resale to retail propane outlets. The facility consists of three 60,000-gallon tanks with a total storage capacity of 158,400 gallons at maximum fill level (88%). \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a 60,000-gallon when filled to the greatest extent allowed (88%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.5 miles, and there are approximately 30 residences within this distance. The alternative release scenario is a break in a 3\" diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.08 miles with a few residences within this distance.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane storage and transfer equipment was designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and appl"

Protective measures include but are not limited to emergency valves on all inlet and outlet piping, breakaway fittings at all cargo truck loading areas, emergency relief valves, impact protection measures for all loading and unloading areas, and lighting and fencing for security.   \n\nDead River has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  In the event of an emergency involving the propane facilities described herein, it is Dead River's policy to notify the Bellows Falls Fire Department and GMRC officials to coordinate an emergency response.  Dead River will also utilize its in-house trained fire brigade.  Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Hampden, ME location that is available for use at any location during emergencies.  For major emergency response, Dead River has agreements with private emergency response contractors to provide these resources when and where needed on a 24-hour basis.  \n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities is organized into 9 Sections.   Since this facility only has flammable and no toxic chemicals covered under 40 CFR 68, and because it is a Program 3 Propane Storage facility with no history of accidents, several of the sections do not apply including:  \n\n \n\nSection 2. Toxics: Worst Case    Not Applicable\n\nSection 3. Toxics: Alternative Release    Not Applicable\n\nSection 6.
