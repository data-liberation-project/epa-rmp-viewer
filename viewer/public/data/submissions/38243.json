Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Union County Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Union County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environments.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application (in farmer owned nurse tanks) as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a tank designed for the purpose.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point was determined with the EPA RMP Comp Model.  The population was determined by using census information from area maps and community directorates.\n\nb. The alternate release scenario: a three inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shutdown valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint was determined with the EPA RMP Comp Model.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the standards fo the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is refer"
