Chlorine is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  It is management\u00bfs commitment to safety and adherence to Federal, State, and local rules and regulations that reduce the threat to our employees and nearby members of the community.  Our safety procedures involve the training if our employees in the safe handling of chlorine and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\nOur facility\u00bfs specific Emergency Action Plan includes notification of the local fire authority.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  At the NRWWTP, the chlorine system exists in an unenclosed building on our property. An emergency chlorine scrubber was put in place to help mitigate a potentially hazardous situation in the event of a chlorine leak within the building.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n The regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.  \n \n The primary purpose of the NRWWTP is to handle the wastewater coming in from the customers and treating to a certain level as specified by the EPA regulations.  One of the treatment processes included in a wastewater treatment plant is disinfection by chlorine. \n \n \n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nA. Worst-Case Scenario \u00bf After careful review of potential worst-case scenarios, we feel that the largest quantity of a cylinder released outside, during a cylinder unloading accident that causes rupture of the cylinder, with no building passive mitigation effects, is our worst-case."

      "SummaryText": "B. Alternative Scenario \u00bf The connection from the chlorine cylinder to the delivery piping breaks causing a flashing liquid release through a small hole approximately \u00bc inch diameter.  The liquid chlorine flashes immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and is carried downwind.\n \n4.\tThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n \n This facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management Standard.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  Our delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained in regard to chlorine hazards and emergency response.  Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing chlorine to our site.  In addition, we contract out to chlorine system professionals to periodically inspect our chlorine system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of chlorine.  We maintain a computer generated preventative maintenance schedule of the chlorine process equipment.\n \n5.\tFive-year accident history:\n \n There have been no accidental releases, injuries, or environmental damage resulting from our chlorine system in the last five years.\n \n6.\tThe emergency response program:\n \n This facility\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan is based upon the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency responders.  We have discussed this program with the Pompano Beach Fire Department. \n\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nA process hazard analysis of the chlorine system was conducted on August 14, 2001.  From this review, the recommendations were:\n\n\u00b7 Evaluate the need for a mechanical or interlocked level on the intake if one is not present\n\n\u00b7 Installation of the end of the interlocke"
