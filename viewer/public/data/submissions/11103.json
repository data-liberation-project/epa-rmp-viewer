All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and by some truck transport.  The Plant is surrounded by a combination of farmland, forest, residences and a few other businesses.  The Title V permit for this facility has been submitted and approval is pending.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \nWorst Case Scenario (WCS)-Toxic \nThe WCS as associated with toxic substances, as defined in the regulation, is a release of hydrogen sulfide gas involving the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  This scenario is extremely remote, but is required by the EPA regulation.  Even though the normal operating pressure and inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The WCS potentially has off-site impacts, but there are no environmental receptors.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS)-Toxic  \nThe ARS is a release of H2S gas venting to the low-pressure flare.  Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., process is protected by alarms, routine monitoring by operating personnel, and periodic inspections), the toxic substance was assumed to be released without ignition at the flare tip.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS.  The ARS has off-site impact potential, but the impact area includes few public receptors and no environmental receptors.\n\nWorst Case Scenario (WCS)-Flammable \nThe WCS, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mi"

      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1992 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nThe Exxon Company, U.S.A. Big Escambia Creek Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency response organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this RMPlan.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Exxon Company, U.S.A. Big Escambia Creek Gas Plant, located 4.5 miles West of Flomaton, Alabama, and 3.3 miles north on state road 2, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas"

Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is significantly less than the maximum capacity and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  No mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The WCS has off-site impact potential, but the impact area includes few public receptors and no environmental receptors.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario (ARS)-Flammable \nThe ARS is a release of flammable materials (i.e., mixture of natural gas liquids) failure by a pressure relief valve to reseat resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Even though this event is unlikely (i.e., process is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel), the maximum inventory of flammable materials in this vessel was assumed to be released and ignited at the point of release.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ARS.  The ARS could have off-site impact potential, but the impact area does not include any public or environmental receptors.\n \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Plant.  Because processes at the Plant regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to (and in compliance with) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Plant provides for and encou"

Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the Plant and addresses each program element.  In addition, the Plant has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nThe Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  OIMS Coordinator at the Plant is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in material safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in the operating procedures.  The Plant ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, a"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Plant primarily uses the What If/Checklist analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  This technique is recognized by OSHA as an acceptable hazard evaluation technique for PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Plant operating/maintenance personnel and facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operating personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is based on relative risk.  Potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk are addressed first.  All resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design; the Plant updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented"

Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and certified as current/accurate.  Procedures are maintained current/accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in Plant operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (i.e., subject matter experts) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, all personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented for each employee.\n\nContractors\nThe Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to help ensure contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropria"

Also, a job safety analysis is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with Plant personnel assistance as needed) prior to each maintenance/construction task.\n\nPlant personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Contractor safety programs/performance are evaluated during the initial selection process, and the Plant supervisor conducts periodic evaluations of safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nThe Plant conducts a PSSR for any Plant modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features; procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality function by verifying that the requirements of this accident prevention program are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nThe Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief/vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, drawings, and procedures are updated for these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training related to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major equipment/property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected.

While there has not been an incident with offsite impacts, there has been one release as defined in the regulation that is reportable due to the amount of damage sustained to onsite equipment.  The incident did not result in any personal injury or environmental damage.  Additional detail is included in Section 6 of this RMPlan. \n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Plant maintains an emergency action program to protect the workers, public, and environment.  The program consists of procedures for handling releases of regulated flammable and toxic substances including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address facility/equipment isolation and shutdown, initial first aid and medical treatment for exposures (i.e. Material Safety Data Sheets information), evacuation plans for the Plant, accounting for Plant personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Plant has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency equipment and alarms.  Plant personnel receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific duties.  \n\nThe emergency action program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary.  Plan changes required because of modifications to the Plant facilities or emergency equipment are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with the Escambia County Emergency Management Association (LEPC), the Atmore"
