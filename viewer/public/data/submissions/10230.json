Conoco's policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant, located in McClain County, Oklahoma, is owned by C&L Processors, which is in partnership between Conoco Inc. and Liquid Energy Corporation, and operated by the Conoco NG&GP Department.  The Goldsby Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant that receives raw natural gas (high pressure and low pressure) by pipeline.  The facility operates a cryogenic train which extract hydrocarbon liquids from the raw natural gas streams.  The Goldsby Gas Plant operation includes inlet gas separation, compression, dehydration, cryogenic gas processing (recovery of natural gas liquids), product storage, and loading equipment.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline and truck.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the Goldsby Gas Plant's inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the"

[Note: The term threshold quantity is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: propane, Propane-Butane-Condensate (PBC)/Ethane-Propane-Butane-Condensate (EPBC) Mix (PBC/EPBC mix), and condensate.  [Note: condensate is exempt from threshold determination provisions based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.].  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure.  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  Propane was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the propane in the largest propane vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not applied because of the assumption for the scenario that the entire contents of the vessel be instantaneously released.

In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Goldsby Gas Plant follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single alternative release scenario for all regulated flammable substances.  For the Goldsby Gas Plant, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the EPBC Mix pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for ten minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as leak detection gas detection and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Goldsby Gas Plant.  The Goldsby Gas Plant has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program regulations for consistency and effectiveness.  As a result, this overview describes the safety management system that is in place for each of the safety management program elements, which also make up the Risk Management Program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll employees (and contractors) at"

More specific ways that employees can be involved in the Risk Management Program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\nIn addition, employees and management have a number of initiatives in place that are designed to improve safety at the plant.  These initiatives are focused on both the plant processes and general worker safety (including slips, trips, and falls), and even off-the-job safety.  These initiatives include safety teams that have been chartered to improve safety, both on and off the job.  These safety teams typically have members from various functional areas of the plant -- including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management -- to ensure the team has a broad perspective, which leads to better ideas to improve safety.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the plant's operations and processes are identified and minimized.

The team also evaluates potential mitigation measures and accident prevention measures for each potential process hazard at the facility.  The final part of the procedure requires the team to make specific suggestions for management consideration to address or mitigate each identified hazard.\n\nThe PHA team's findings and suggestions are provided to plant management for further evaluation and resolution.  All approved mitigation options are then tracked as part of the process until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted every 5 years and will continue at this frequency as long as the plant is in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant maintains a variety of technical data that is used to ensure safe operation of the processes.

After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, only then can they work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant uses contractors to perform many project-specific activities and supplement the plant workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction periods.  For those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place, that when followed, ensure that these contractors:\n\n7 perform their work in a safe manner, \n7 have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process,\n7 are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n7 understand what they should do in the event of an incident,\n7 understand and follow site safety rules, and\n7 inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that their work brings and/or that they find during their work.\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant has developed and implemented safe work practices and procedures to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employers and employees in covered process areas.\n\nEach contract employee is provided with site-specific training on the hazards that may exist at the plant.

Operating procedures that address various modes of process operations are maintained, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent training of new operators, and they provide good reference materials for experienced operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Whenever a process modification is made, the procedures are revised as appropriate to cover the modification.  The procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThese procedures are used in employee training, and are readily available to employees to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Goldsby Gas Plant employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.

The Goldsby Gas Plant has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and/or procedures are updated as appropriate to incorporate the effects of the modification.
