(also \"SCP\") stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  SCP has Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting hazardous chemical accidents or releases and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  SCP has Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as its Emergency Escape Mask  Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental release.   \n\nSCP's Emergency Action Plan is contained in section N of its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available, safety goggles, gloves and an escape mask.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A verbal notification system is in place to alert personnel about chlorine leaks. A chlorine leak detector is also on site for early detection of any leak, and an audible alarm to warn employees.  An Emergency Response contact sheet is posted on site and identifies who to call in the event of a release, which in"

Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one-ton containers to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools. The facility operates five days a week (M-F),and approximately eight hours per day, 50 weeks per year.\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\nThe Fill Yard is enclosed by a barbed wire fence and a locked gate. It houses all of the chlorine containers and is locked after normal working hours, and or when unattended.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel into the fill yard area. Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  Container handling and storage is per applicable local, state and federal regulations. \n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months,   are the busiest swim times of the year, and the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. SCP stores a maximum of 9.000 pounds of chlorine, which exceeds the 2,500 pound federal threshold.This ammount includes the contents of 3 one-ton containers, 50 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process. \n \nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 4, are stored and/or used in the Fill Yard.\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a cherry picker/crane or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on the rails in the Fill Yard.  The on"

Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are stored in a in an upright position and cheined. The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 4 one-ton containers and 50 each twenty pound cylinders for a maximum total of 9,000 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed the maximum amount. \n\nChlorine is repackaged from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine is directed into a liquid caustic absorption tank.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT aproved containers, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption vacuum system.\n\nThe packaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container.  Only a small amount of residual chlorine remains in the lines after fill to be routed to the caustic tank.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the vacuum system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written filling procedures exist and are followed.

There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitment to an accidental release prevention program. \n\nSCP has a maintenance program for equipment, including visual equipment inspections, and sensor calibration.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6.
