      "SummaryText": "REFRIGERATION SYSTEM PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\nThis system is a single stage configuration utilizing controllers for system operation.  There are a total of five screw compressors that handle the refrigeration loads. All five compressors operate on both a -25F recirculator package and a +25F package.  All compressors have a side port (or economizer port) to maintain the +25F high side trap.  \n\nThere are two separate suction temperatures a -25F low temperature recirculator to maintain freezer rooms and a +25F high temperature recirculator. The high temperature recirculator maintains dock temperatures and any cooler rooms at +30 or above.\n\n\n\nThere are three rooftop mounted evaporative condensers.  Two of these condensers have a common remote sump and one has a local or built in sump.  There are also two heat exchanger units for under floor heating, one shell and tube and one plate and frame. \n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\n\n\nLiquid Side:\n\n\n\nThe liquid supply for the system starts at the condenser.  The condenser removes heat from the superheated vapor discharged from the compressors such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  This condensed liquid leaves the condenser unit, via a 4\" inch pipe and flows to the thermosyphon receiver, V-1.  The liquid in the thermosyphon is used in conjunction with heat exchangers for compressor oil cooling.  The condensed liquid, which is a high pressure liquid, leaves the thermosyphon receiver and travels to the high pressure receiver, V-2, via a 3\" pipe.    \n\n\n\nThe high pressure liquid leaves the high pressure receiver via a 2\" line and feeds the high temp recirculator package, V-4.  During this process, the liquid ammonia changes from a high pressure liquid to a low pressure liquid after entering an expansion valve.  \n\n\n\nThe liquid also gets transferred from the high temperature recirculator package to the low temp recirculator package as product load would necessitate.  \n\n\n\nThe low and high temperature recirculators ar"

The liquid from the low and high temperature recirculators is pumped to the different evaporator units in the plant, depending on the temperature of the room they are removing heat from.\n\n\n\nVapor Side:\n\n\n\nThe compressors remove the vapors from both the high temperature recirculator and the low temperature recirculator vessels.  \n\n\n\nScrew compressors, C-1 through C-5, remove the vapors from the high temperature recirculator through the side port or economizer ports.  These compressors also remove vapors from the low temperature recirculator through the larger main suction line.  Regardless of the recirculator temperature on the suction side, the discharge of all the compressors, C-1 through C-5, is sent to the main discharge header, which feeds the condenser unit.  The condenser removes heat from the superheated vapor discharged from the compressors such that the vapor changes to a liquid (condenses).  \n\n\n\nAdditionally, as required, some of the superheated discharge vapors (hot gas) are diverted for use as a defrosting medium for the evaporators.  The hot gas is sent through the evaporators for removal of ice that has built up on the coils.\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\nThermosyphon System:\n\n\n\nA thermosyphon system is a means by which an uninterrupted supply of liquid refrigerant can be supplied to the compressor units. This liquid utilizes a heat exchanger to keep the compressors' oil cooled and thus allowing the units to operate at the manufacturer's recommended temperature.\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia is supplied to the inlet of the heat exchanger. When a heat load is applied to the heat exchanger, some of the liquid is vaporized. This vapor-liquid mixture is less dense than pure liquid ammonia. The denser liquid (supply) displaces the lighter vapor-liquid mixture thus pushing the mixture out of the heat exchanger and back to the thermosyphon receiver. This difference in "

The recirculator system supplies liquid to the various evaporators.  The outlet of the evaporators (consisting of liquid and vapor) is returned to the recirculator vessel for separation of the liquid and vapor before going to the compressors.\n\n\n\nThe application can be either a low temp or high temp application.
