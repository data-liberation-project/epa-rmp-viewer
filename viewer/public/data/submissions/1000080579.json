              "Description": "The function of the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit is to convert low value heavy gas oils to more valuable lighter fractions, primarily gasoline, through catalytic cracking process. The unit takes sweet vacuum gas oil from the hydrotreater unit and from storage, and light gas oil from the hydrotreater unit. The unit produces considerable volumes of butane-butylene, and propane-propylene, in addition to clarified slurry oil (CSO) and light cycle oil (LCO).\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the unsaturated gas plant is to separate gasoline range hydrocarbons into gasoline and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG). The unit stabilizes the FCC gasoline by removing the light gaseous hydrocarbons from it and removes H2S from the olefinic LPG.The products from the unsaturated gas plant are the gasoline, olefin LPG, and fuel gas.",

      "SummaryText": "1. Introduction and Policies\n\nThe Torrance Refining Company has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the refinery's processes. The objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the refinery's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nThe refinery Process Safety Management System (PSMS) framework establishes expectations for controlling operations integrity risks inherent in its business. PSMS addresses all aspects of the business that can impact safety, health and process safety performance. PSMS encompasses all elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nTorrance Refining Company, LLC, located in Torrance, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from crude oil. The refinery contains a threshold quantity of several regulated flammable substances and one toxic substance, hydrofluoric acid (HF). Anhydrous ammonia is also in use in one process, but in quantities less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.150, in 2014 the refinery prepared a 5-year update to the previous Risk Management Plan (RMP). Updates were done in 2016 to account for two 2015 RMP reportable incidents at the refinery. The refinery contains a total of eleven covered processes for the purpose of this report. Each process is listed below along with the category of regulated materials contained within the process:\n\n\n\nProcess 1: DIB Butane Processing - Flammables\n\nProcess 2: Fuel Gas Treatment - Fla"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. The Torrance Refinery Process Safety Management System (PSMS) consist of 21 elements that make up the PSMS.  These 21 elements address the various requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.  Each element of the PSMS has a Sponsor and Administrator whom have the responsibility of understanding the regulatory requirements addressed by element, ensuring their element provides the appropriate framework for the refinery to implement and sustain compliance, and providing feedback on their element to the Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC).  All 21 PSMS elements have a system plan which shapes the methodology, standards and practices for that specific element.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC) is comprised of both represented employees, such as the USW Process Safety Representative and the USW Co-Chair of the Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC) and different levels of site management.  The PSMC is responsible for implementing the PSMS, reviewing the effectiveness of the PSMS elements, and encouraging continuous improvement of the elements.\n\n\n\nTorrance Refinery has the PSMS Mapping Document which identifies the PSMS elements, their assigned Sponsor and Administrator, the regulatory topic, and the applicable regulatory citations relevant to that specific element.  The purpose of the PSMS Mapping document is to clearly identify the responsible p"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team and the Process Safety Management Committee. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. The Employee Participation Plan includes participation by the Joint Health & Safety Committee which consists of employees from Management (salaried), the USW (United Steel Workers) representatives and the IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers) representatives.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe refinery keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, pressure, flow and compositions. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems both passive and active (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems, dikes, pressure vessel design, and technology.\n\n\n\nInformation about the design and construction of process equipment includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with maintenance procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the Guide Word Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.
