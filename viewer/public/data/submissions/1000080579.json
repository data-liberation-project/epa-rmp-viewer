Each element of the PSMS has a Sponsor and Administrator whom have the responsibility of understanding the regulatory requirements addressed by element, ensuring their element provides the appropriate framework for the refinery to implement and sustain compliance, and providing feedback on their element to the Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC).  All 21 PSMS elements have a system plan which shapes the methodology, standards and practices for that specific element.\r\n\r\nThe Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC) is comprised of both represented employees, such as the USW Process Safety Representative and the USW Co-Chair of the Joint Health and Safety Committee (JHSC) and different levels of site management.  The PSMC is responsible for implementing the PSMS, reviewing the effectiveness of the PSMS elements, and encouraging continuous improvement of the elements.\r\n\r\nTorrance Refinery has the PSMS Mapping Document which identifies the PSMS elements, their assigned Sponsor and Administrator, the regulatory topic, and the applicable regulatory citations relevant to that specific element.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the refinery's processes. The objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the refinery's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nThe refinery Process Safety Management System (PSMS) framework establishes expectations for controlling operations integrity risks inherent in its business. PSMS addresses all aspects of the business that can impact safety, health and process safety performance. PSMS encompasses all elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nTorrance Refining Company, LLC, located in Torrance, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from crude oil. The refinery contains a threshold quantity of several regulated flammable substances and one toxic substance, hydrofluoric acid (HF). Anhydrous ammonia is also in use in one process, but in quantities less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.150, in 2014 the refinery prepared a 5-year update to the previous Risk Management Plan (RMP). Updates were done in 2016 to account for two 2015 RMP reportable incidents at the refinery. The refinery contains a total of eleven covered processes for the purpose of this report. Each process is listed below along with the category of regulated materials contained within the process:\r\n\r\nProcess 1: DIB Butane Processing - Flammables\r\nProcess 2: Fuel Gas Treatment - Fla"
