The Emergency Response Program \nincorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response \nequipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for \nemployees involved in the chlorination process, and \nprocedures to review and update, as appropriate, the \nemergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that \nemployees are informed of changes.\n\n2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Nevins Station is located in northeast El Paso on \nWoodrow Bean Trans Mountain Road west of Rushing Road. The \nregulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine."

      "SummaryText": "The chlorination process area at this facility is located at \nthe west end of the pump station. The chlorination process \narea includes a ton-container storage area and an enclosed \nchlorine process room. The ton-container storage area \ncontains two (2) one-ton pressurized liquid chlorine \ncontainers. The chlorine process room houses the gas \ndispensers, ejectors, residual analyzers, and a chlorine \nleak detector. The leak detection system is capable of \nalarming when the chlorine levels reach or exceed 3.0 parts \nper million(ppm). The audible and visual alarm system alerts \npersonnel in case of a chlorine release.\n\nThe level of concern or `toxic endpoint' for chlorine is 3.0 \nppm (40 CFR 68.22).  An accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance is considered to result in no adverse impact to \npublic health at distances, from the point of release, \nextending beyond the toxic endpoint.\n\n3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE \nSCENARIO(S)\n\nThe RMP rule requires the EPWU-PSB to conduct offsite \nconsequence analyses for two chlorine release scenarios, \nidentified as `worst case release' and `alternative release' \nscenarios. The worst case release scenario is defined by the \nRMP rule as `the release of the largest quantity of a \nregulated substance from a vessel or process line failure \nthat results in the greatest distance to [the toxic] \nendpoint' (40 CFR 68.3). The alternative release scenario is \ndefined as a release more likely to occur than the worst \ncase scenario.  \n\nThe release scenarios were modeled using the air dispersion \nmodel Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA). The \nworst case release scenario is the release of the entire \ncontents of a one-ton container under the conditions \nprescribed by the RMP rule. The distance to the toxic \nendpoint for the worst case release scenario is 3.0 miles. \nThe alternative release scenario is the release of chlorine \nfrom a pipe leak with a hole diameter of 1/8 inch.

The Emergency Response Program has been \ncoordinated with the El Paso County Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the El Paso Fire Department Hazardous \nMaterials Division. This program is in compliance with the \nRMP Emergency Response Program requirements. \n\n7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe EPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the \nchlorination process operating procedures in order to make \ncertain that the operators understand the human factors that \nmay lead to accidental releases."
