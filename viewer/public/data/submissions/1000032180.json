The review examined the hazards associated with the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process and the use of anhydrous ammonia. It also assessed the opportunities for equipment malfunction or human errors that could cause an accidental release. Safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error were evaluated. The analysis also included the review of steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the PHA, OPPD's Program 3 Prevention Program incorporates all of the required elements, including:\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: OPPD has developed written operating procedures for the safe storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at Nebraska City Station. The procedures specify steps for each operating phase of the process and operating limits (e.g., pressure in the tanks). OPPD has outlined appropriate safety and health considerations and incorporated them into the safe operating procedures.\n\n\n\nTraining: OPPD has a training program related to operation, inspection, and maintenance of the SCR anhydrous ammonia system to ensure safe operation.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: OPPD has written procedures for maintaining the integrity of the process equipment. OPPD has identified inspections and maintenance practices needed to comply with the standard.

It is located 5 miles south of Nebraska City in Otoe County, Nebraska.  Nebraska City Station's Unit 2 uses anhydrous ammonia in the operation of its selective catalytic reduction (SCR) pollution prevention system. Anhydrous ammonia is the only Risk Management Program (RMP) listed chemical that is present at Nebraska City Station above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nOPPD is committed to employee and public safety and the protection of the environment. To demonstrate this commitment, OPPD has invested significant resources in preventing the release of anhydrous ammonia; as is evident in all elements of OPPD's prevention program.  As an example, OPPD requires all employees, contractors, vendors, and unescorted visitors to take general ammonia awareness training.\n\n\n\nOverall safety at Nebraska City Station is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases that may occur. OPPD has developed a robust emergency response program which includes having a trained Hazardous Material Response Team on-site and coordinating emergency response with the local emergency response agency. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOPPD's Program 3 Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia system is a rigorous program which meets the requirements of both the RMP and the PSM regulations. \n\n\n\nOPPD updated and revalidated its Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on 12/28/2012.
