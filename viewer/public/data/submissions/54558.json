The company endeavors to execute these policies through the implementation of its Safety Program.  The company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases.  It is the primary goal of WPS to protect employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to company operations.\n\nWPS has adopted a ?non-responding facility? policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator is established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department is performed on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submission of appropriate Reports and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  \n\nWPS policy also includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training refreshed annually.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  The comp"

WPS provides ammonia refrigeration services and equipment to many of the seasonally operated coolers in the area. Two ammonia storage vessels are used for temporary seasonal storage of ammonia.  The first of the two storage vessels was placed on-site in 1988.  The second vessel was acquired in 1994.\n\nProduce growing and shipping is a seasonal event in Yuma.  Typically, fresh vegetables come into season in November and finish in April.  When cooling equipment is taken out of service in the spring, the refrigerant is transferred out of that equipment and stored in the vessels at WPS-Yuma Shop.  The vessels are rated for ammonia storage service and are equipped with isolation and Pressure Relief Valves installed in accordance with applicable codes. The only Regulated Substance is anhydrous ammonia, CAS# 7664-41-7.\n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The written PSM document is maintained on-site.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of the Storage Facility operation.  The facility does not qualify for the RMP or PSM Program (>10,000 lbs NH3) during the Yuma busy season, which lasts from Fall until Spring (approximately 9-10 months).  At that time the ammonia is being used in off-site equipment. Storage of ammonia at or above the 10,000 pound Threshold lasts approximately 3-4 months (Summer off-season).  \n\nWPS actively encourages "

The tanks are in a protected area, covered with shade to minimize the exposure to radiant heat from sunlight.  Traffic barriers are in place to discourage vehicle traffic at the tanks.  In 1997 a water system was installed to help cool the tanks on extremely hot days (120 degrees F+), or periods of prolonged high heat.  The water system provides effective evaporative cooling of the tank skin, which reduces the pressure in the vessel.  Pressure Relief Valves are installed on the vessels per applicable codes.\n\nMaintenance is performed on the vessels and/or associated equipment in the winter months when they are usually empty.  New pressure relief valves are scheduled for installation every 5 years per industry standards.   A vapor compressor and 4-way valve system provides the means to transfer refrigerant to or from the vessels.  The compressor and hose system is inspected regularly for damage; wear and tear.  Appropriate equipment is color-coded.  Locked storage for transfer hoses was added in January 2004.\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at WPS - Yuma Shop:\n\n?    The storage vessel system at WPS/Yuma Shop differs from other storage systems (fertilizer terminals) in this way:  The transfer activity takes place during a few weeks per year whereas a typical terminal will have daily transfer activity.  WPS feels that this minimum number of transfers provides a reduction of risk and exposure.\n?    Only pre-qualified technicians are authorized to perform transfer activities. \n?    Written procedures detail the steps necessary to safely transfer ammonia in or out of the vessels.\n?    Policy requires two or more qualified personnel present to perform transfers. \n?

The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.  Storage of combustibles (wood pallets, detritus) near the vessels is prohibited.\n?    Warning signs and emergency numbers are posted.\n?    WPS played an integral role instituting the ?Yuma-Area Ammonia Safety Day? scheduled annually for November.  Numerous Fire Departments are included on the invitation list. Managing and responding to an ammonia emergency is a regular topic.  In this way, WPS has established relationships and a higher degree of coordination with Fire Departments that may be involved in ammonia response activities on an area-wide basis.  WPS has been engaged with local emergency coordination efforts since February, 1994.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.  There is no data to report.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel are trained to notify and evacuate via the Emergency Action Plan.  Only the Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.  Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  Written ammonia emergency response procedures are detailed in the facility?s ?Thirty Minute Plan?.  Appropriate written plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.  Local Emergency Response capabilities have been verified.  The Yuma area has a Haz-Mat Response Team and Mutual Aid Agreement. \n  \n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n?
