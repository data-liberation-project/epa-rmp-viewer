In addition to several other generating facilities, TECO owns and operates Polk Power Station (PPS) located on SR 37 S in Polk County, Florida. \r\nPPS has 5 electric generating units. The first is an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) which is a coal-fired unit that produces syngas for electric generation. This unit can also run as a 1-on-1 natural gas combined cycle unit. The station also has a 4-on-1 natural gas combined cycle unit, two of these units can run on fuel oil and all four combustion turbines can run in simple cycle mode, as a peaking unit. These units use dry low NOx (DLN) technology to reduce NOx emissions. Additionally, the heat recovery steam generators have a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system installed to further reduce NOx emissions while operating in combined cycle mode. The SCR is designed to reduce NOx emissions by reacting ammonia with NOx in the flue gas to yield nitrogen and water vapor in the presence of a catalyst. The SCR process contains more than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia for RMP.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nPPS is committed to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. The facility also exceeds the anhydrous ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. A PSM program has been implemented which serves as the RMP Prevention Program. The program includes provisions for the management of the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including evaluations of process design and changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, emergency plans and procedures, training, and other elements which impa"
