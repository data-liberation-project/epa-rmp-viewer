      "SummaryText": "Safety Commitments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVienna Beef is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68 to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Ammonia Refrigeration Process\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses roughly 14,000 pounds of ammonia for process areas. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors. The condenser is mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective spiral freezers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility uses approximately 14,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equi"

This vapor is then piped to the condenser, where the ammonia is converted back to high pressure liquid and recycled to the Thermosiphon Receiver. The auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the High Pressure Receiver and the condensers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Worst Case Scenario\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 14,000 pounds of ammonia resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and the auto-dialing system in place to warn operating personnel of process upsets; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Alternative Case Scenario\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a broken condenser tube venting to the atmosphere. According to the EPA in their RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance (Reference Table 2) the scenario involves the r"

Under neutral weather conditions, Class D atmospheric stability and wind speed of 3.0 m/s, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is .20 mile radius. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidental release of ammonia, Vienna Beef complies with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68, ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no 5-year accident history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).

This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.

The facility is equipped with a siren to warn the community of an emergency."
