It is our belief that the employees operating the equipment are those best equipped to prevent releases.  Employee participation ranges from compiling and updating technical data to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program and information on accidents themselves.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in the integrated management system that is maintained on an intranet-based management system available to the global OXEA population.  \r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.

Process areas have documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters and strive to ensure that the processes are maintained within these limits by using process control equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as level alarms, automated shutdown systems, and pressure relief devices.\r\n\r\nOXEA Bishop maintains technical documents that provide design and construction details of the process equipment.

This information combined with written standard operating procedures and personnel training provide a basis for inspection and maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed changes.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\r\nOXEA Bishop uses a comprehensive PHA process to help identify and control hazards associated with production processes.  PHAs are performed on an established schedule, and each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage identified hazards.  PHAs are revalidated on a five-year frequency.  Details of the PHA process are available to all OXEA employees in the intranet based integrated management system.  \r\n\r\nThe OXEA PHA process uses a variety of tools to identify process hazards, accident prevention, and mitigation measures.

The EPA RMP regulation covers many elements: hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  The RMP regulation applies to facilities that use more than specified amounts of certain designated chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to the OXEA Bishop Facility based on its use of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED CHEMICALS\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility is located between the communities of Kingsville (Kleberg County) and Bishop (Nueces County), Texas.  It is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Nueces County.  Four employee shifts operate the facility round-the-clock.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has approximately 35 employees and a small force of contract employees.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 2007, Advent International purchased a portion of the Celanese Bishop Facility and established the OXEA Bishop Facility.  Prior to that date, the purchased production units were part of the Celanese Bishop Facility and were covered under an RMP filed by Celanese.  The Celanese Bishop Facility began production in 1945 to provide raw materials for its fibers operations on the US East Coast.  The production units now owned by OXEA began production in 1958 and 1960; they have operated continuously since then.\r\n\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility\u00bfs units are nestled within the larger Celanese facility which covers approximately 1200 acres.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has two Program Level 3 processes that use several steps (i.e., hydrogenation, separation, etc.) to produce chemical intermediates.  The OXEA products are then are sold to other chemical manufacturers that use the products in their manufacturing processes.  OXEA products are used in the production of"

OXEA also uses a documented Safe Work Permit process to ensure that the job is evaluated for hazards and that those hazards are mitigated prior to commencing work.  \r\n\r\nOXEA personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated during the selection process and are reviewed periodically by facility EHS and management.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR)\r\nOXEA uses a PSSR process to review modifications that cause a significant change in the process safety information. The PSSR will help ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The PSSR provides an additional opportunity to check that construction was executed as specified in the design and all supporting systems are ready. The PSSR involves construction field verification.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY (MI)\r\nOXEA Bishop uses established practices and procedures to maintain process and support equipment in a safe operating condition. The MI program includes training, inspections, correction of deficiencies, and quality assurance of work products.  Maintenance personnel are trained on the process, safety and health hazards, maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and safe work processes to help ensure that they execute their jobs safely.  Documented equipment files and maintenance histories help maintain consistent performance of repairs. \r\n\r\nInspections and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.

Orientations are provided for all visitors and contractors.  The facility has controlled access for employees, visitors, and contractors.  Work on specific equipment is governed by a job permitting system to ensure that all hazards are identified and addressed prior to commencing work.  These safe work processes, supporting procedures, and training on the processes ensure that maintenance activities are safely performed. \r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\r\nOXEA Bishop has a comprehensive and mature management of change system. It requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, operating technology, procedures, and other changes be reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to ensure controls are in place to manage new hazards and verify that no existing controls have been compromised.  Changes are documented on corresponding chemical hazard lists, process operating parameters, equipment files, and procedures.  Affected personnel are trained on the changes to be implemented. \r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nOXEA Bishop documents and investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major damage to property or equipment, environmental release / damage, or personal injury. The investigation strives to record the facts of the incident and identify how to prevent recurrence.   Incident information, including required corrective actions, is maintained in an electronic database available to all OXEA employees.

Releases are controlled by the use of pressure relief devices that discharge to atmosphere and boiler system; manual and automatic isolation valves; automated shut down systems for key equipment; and redundant equipment.  The impact of releases are reduced or mitigated by the use of fire extinguishing systems, personal protective equipment for affected personnel, secondary containment, process fluid isolation sumps, and access to on-site emergency response team.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nOXEA Bishop had one (1) incidents / accidents that meet the RMP regulation"

Celanese Bishop provides administrative coordination for the emergency plan and emergency response personnel; OXEA Bishop provides emergency response personnel for each shift.  The emergency plan is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment. The plan addresses many emergency scenarios but those of specific importance to the RMP are the scenarios dealing with releases of regulated chemicals, including fires and explosions.  The emergency plan is reviewed annually and revised as needed. Changes triggered by the Management of Change process are administered per that specific program and include training of affected personnel. \r\n\r\nThe Bishop complex emergency response program is coordinated with the Corpus Christi / Nueces County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), City of Bishop Volunteer Fire Department, Kingsville Fire Department, Kleberg County Sheriff's Department, and local ambulance services. The OXEA Bishop Facility has 24-hour communications capability with the emergency response organizations.  Periodic emergency plan drills are conducted and an annual evacuation drill is conducted for all employees.  The emergency response team members train on a continual basis."
