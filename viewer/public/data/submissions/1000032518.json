The EPA RMP regulation covers many elements: hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  The RMP regulation applies to facilities that use more than specified amounts of certain designated chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to the OXEA Bishop Facility based on its use of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED CHEMICALS\n\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility is located between the communities of Kingsville (Kleberg County) and Bishop (Nueces County), Texas.  It is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Nueces County.  Four employee shifts operate the facility round-the-clock.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has approximately 35 employees and a small force of contract employees.\n\n\n\nOn March 1, 2007, Advent International purchased a portion of the Celanese Bishop Facility and established the OXEA Bishop Facility.  Prior to that date, the purchased production units were part of the Celanese Bishop Facility and were covered under an RMP filed by Celanese.  The Celanese Bishop Facility began production in 1945 to provide raw materials for its fibers operations on the US East Coast.  The production units now owned by OXEA began production in 1958 and 1960; they have operated continuously since then.\n\n\n\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility?s units are nestled within the larger Celanese facility which covers approximately 1200 acres.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has two Program Level 3 processes that use several steps (i.e., hydrogenation, separation, etc.) to produce chemical intermediates.  The OXEA products are then are sold to other chemical manufacturers that use the products in their manufacturing processes.  OXEA products are used in the production of "

The RMP regulation requires the modeling of releases for a toxic and flammable chemical.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the OXEA Bishop Facility accident prevention program.  Because processes at the OXEA Bishop Facility regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the summary addresses OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility expects all employees to participate in the PSM program and accident prevention.  It is our belief that the employees operating the equipment are those best equipped to prevent releases.  Employee participation ranges from compiling and updating technical data to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program and information on accidents themselves.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in the integrated management system that is maintained on an intranet-based management system available to the global OXEA population.  \n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\n\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.
