Chemical safety is a number one priority with support from the highest level of\nmanagement.  The Environmental and Safety Department reports directly to the Vice President, who\nreports directly to the CEO and President. Thus Senior Management promotes safety and\nenvironmental compliance.\n\n     There are many programs in place to promote chemical safety and the facility is usually\nsubjected to at least four surprise inspections a year by different governmental agencies.  The\nhazardous waste incineration industry is one of the most highly regulated in the country.  Not only\ndoes LWD comply with numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs such as Risk Management Plan (RMP), it also\ncomplies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, the Emergency Planning and\nCommunity Right to Know Act (EPCRA) programs, State and Local Fire Code programs, and the\nNational Electrical Code programs.   To even further promote chemical safety, the Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs Process Safety Management (PSM) and\nHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) also regulates the facility. \n\n     As part of the RMP and PSM programs, LWD's chemical safety program begins with quality\nassurance for all equipment, piping systems, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, controls,\nemergency systems, and pumps.  This guarantees that these units meet all applicable design codes\nand specifications.  Thi"

Documentation of the codes\nand specifications form the basis of the process information.  An employee participation plan ensures\nthat employees are involved throughout the program adding experience and a working knowledge\nof the process to the safety suggestions.  This combination of engineering, process information, and\nanalysis is supplemented by trained employees working with specific operating instructions to\naddress all contingencies to ensure operations are conducted within safe limits.  \n\n     The facility has layers of protection built into its process.  The first level includes the\npersonnel.  Trained operators are working with operating instructions and process safety information\nto keep the process operation safe and in environmental compliance.  The second level involves\ntechnical controls.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to maintain the process\nwithin these limits.  Process safety control systems include: relief vents; check valves; manual\nshutoffs; interlocks; alarms; a keyed bypass; grounding equipment; and a purge system.  Monitoring\nand detection systems include: process area monitors; personal monitors; portable monitors; camera\nsystems; special indicator paint; and daily inspections by trained safety personnel.  In addition, each\nshift has a designated trained supervisor to be responsible for environmental and safety compliance. \n\n     To supplement and enhance these on-site programs, LWD participates in several\norganizations which promote safe environmental and chemical practices.  As a member of the\nCalvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) it can rely on pooled resources from\nsurrounding plants and communities.

LWD is also a member of\nthe Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration in which detailed safety and compliance\ninformation is shared to further promote the safe and effective thermal treatment of hazardous\nwastes.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n     The facility, which is located in Calvert City, KY, includes three hazardous waste\nincinerators and affiliated hazardous waste storage facilities.  Many of the chemical safety\nprocedures mentioned previously are designed specifically for chemicals handled by the facility,\nwhich include familiar household products such as paints, adhesives, herbicides, pesticides, cleaners,\nand solvents.  Specifically, the Risk Management Chemicals at the LWD facility include Hydrogen\nFluoride, Formaldehyde, Isobutane, and Vinyl Methyl Ether.  Many of these items would be\nimmediately recognizable by the average individual if trade names were used instead of chemical\nnames.  The major difference is the volume of waste that a household would produce versus an\nindustrial application.  Where a household would have a gallon of drain cleaner stored in a safe place\naway from the reach of small children, LWD would have hundreds of gallons stored in a safe place\naway from persons unaware of the hazards.  Chemicals such as hydrogen fluoride, commonly used\nas a wheel cleaner or an oven cleaner, and isobutane, which is a common non-CFC aerosol\npropellant, are included in the release scenarios for the Risk Management Plan.  Just as in a\nhousehold, these chemicals are not always present.

Although these safety systems are in place, the\nworst case scenario does not take into account any of the responses that the trained operators may\nimplement.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\n     The five-year accident history for the facility includes one reportable incident under RMP.\nThe incident occurred in 1997 when an employee did not properly close a valve and material leaked\ncausing a flash fire from which one employee received burns.  Operating procedures were revised\nand additional training was conducted to prevent any reoccurrence  The incident was attributed to\nhuman error.  The release did not result in any off-site consequences, nor has the facility ever had\nany RMP release that resulted in off-site consequences.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n     \n     In compliance with the RMP rule and Part 270.25(a)(7) and Subpart D of Part 264 (264.50\nthrough 56) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulation, LWD has maintained a\nContingency Plan detailing procedures to \"minimize hazards to human health or the environment\nfrom fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or\nhazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water\".  This contingency plan provides an\nexplicit description of the response procedures to be implemented in an emergency situation which\nwill protect the public, workers on the site, and the environment. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     LWD is committed to safely providing solutions to society's hazardous waste management\nneeds.  The programs in place will continue to be improved as technology and science improves. \nWe are committed to making chemical safety a number one priority through safe-operating\nprocedures, trained personnel, and environmentally sound treatment processes.  Participation in the\nvarious environmental and safety focus"
