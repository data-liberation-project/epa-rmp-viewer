Chemical safety is a number one priority with support from the highest level of\nmanagement.  The Environmental and Safety Department reports directly to the Vice President, who\nreports directly to the CEO and President. Thus Senior Management promotes safety and\nenvironmental compliance.\n\n     There are many programs in place to promote chemical safety and the facility is usually\nsubjected to at least four surprise inspections a year by different governmental agencies.  The\nhazardous waste incineration industry is one of the most highly regulated in the country.  Not only\ndoes LWD comply with numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs such as Risk Management Plan (RMP), it also\ncomplies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, the Emergency Planning and\nCommunity Right to Know Act (EPCRA) programs, State and Local Fire Code programs, and the\nNational Electrical Code programs.   To even further promote chemical safety, the Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs Process Safety Management (PSM) and\nHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) also regulates the facility. \n\n     As part of the RMP and PSM programs, LWD's chemical safety program begins with quality\nassurance for all equipment, piping systems, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, controls,\nemergency systems, and pumps.  This guarantees that these units meet all applicable design codes\nand specifications.  Thi"

This combination of engineering, process information, and\nanalysis is supplemented by trained employees working with specific operating instructions to\naddress all contingencies to ensure operations are conducted within safe limits.  \n\n     The facility has layers of protection built into its process.  The first level includes the\npersonnel.  Trained operators are working with operating instructions and process safety information\nto keep the process operation safe and in environmental compliance.  The second level involves\ntechnical controls.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to maintain the process\nwithin these limits.  Process safety control systems include: relief vents; check valves; manual\nshutoffs; interlocks; alarms; a keyed bypass; grounding equipment; and a purge system.  Monitoring\nand detection systems include: process area monitors; personal monitors; portable monitors; camera\nsystems; special indicator paint; and daily inspections by trained safety personnel.  In addition, each\nshift has a designated trained supervisor to be responsible for environmental and safety compliance. \n\n     To supplement and enhance these on-site programs, LWD participates in several\norganizations which promote safe environmental and chemical practices.

LWD is also a member of\nthe Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration in which detailed safety and compliance\ninformation is shared to further promote the safe and effective thermal treatment of hazardous\nwastes.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n     The facility, which is located in Calvert City, KY, includes three hazardous waste\nincinerators and affiliated hazardous waste storage facilities.  Many of the chemical safety\nprocedures mentioned previously are designed specifically for chemicals handled by the facility,\nwhich include familiar household products such as paints, adhesives, herbicides, pesticides, cleaners,\nand solvents.  Specifically, the Risk Management Chemicals at the LWD facility include Hydrogen\nFluoride, Formaldehyde, Isobutane, and Vinyl Methyl Ether.  Many of these items would be\nimmediately recognizable by the average individual if trade names were used instead of chemical\nnames.  The major difference is the volume of waste that a household would produce versus an\nindustrial application.  Where a household would have a gallon of drain cleaner stored in a safe place\naway from the reach of small children, LWD would have hundreds of gallons stored in a safe place\naway from persons unaware of the hazards.  Chemicals such as hydrogen fluoride, commonly used\nas a wheel cleaner or an oven cleaner, and isobutane, which is a common non-CFC aerosol\npropellant, are included in the release scenarios for the Risk Management Plan.  Just as in a\nhousehold, these chemicals are not always present.

Passive mitigation was used in the\nalternative case for formaldehyde since the storage tank has secondary containment.  Although there\nare active controls and measures directed at preventing and controlling the consequences of such\nreleases, no credit was taken for active mitigation methods in evaluating these alternative scenarios.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps   \n\n     LWD has a general accident release prevention program which includes extensive classroom\nand on the job training for all its employees.  This training also requires each employee take a\ncompetency exam.  This program instructs the employee in safe working practices, ranging from the\nproper operation of a fork lift to the process operations.
