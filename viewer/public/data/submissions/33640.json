There is approximately 19,500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia located on site.SouthWest Foods Ice Cream has used Anhydrous Ammonia at this site since its inception in 1997 and has never experienced a reportable release.\nThe main hazards associated with Anhydrous Ammonia at this site would include a release of the entire system into the atmosphere. Because of the safeties that are in place this would be unlikely to occur. However, a catastrophic event such as earthquake or tornado could possibly cause such a release.\nThe entire facility is behind a eight foot security fence with authorized personnel access to and from premisis. The entire facility is guarded by armed security personnel 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nSouthWest Foods Ice Cream maintenance personnel have over 100 years of combined experience with anhydrous ammonia. Maintenance employees responsible for the ammonia system are trained every six months in donning and doffing emergency response equipment such as SCBA, Ammonia Resirators, Level A Suits, and other required PPE.\nSouthWest Foods Ice Cream maintains a close relationship with the LEPC, Winona Fire Department, Tyler Fire Department, and Hazmat Team.

      "SummaryText": " that all parties serve as back up to SouthWest Foods Ice Cream personnel in the event of an ammonia release.\nAll on site partners are trained in emergency evacuation annually. All new partners are trained in emergency evacuation and ammonia awareness during the new partner orientation process.\nAll SouthWest Foods Ice Cream plant ammonia equipment is located in an enclosed room that is vented to the atmosphere. All piping is routed to the roof so that if there was a release it would be released outdoors. An \"Emergency Anhydrous Control Box\" is located outside the facility that would allow the entire system to be shut down manually in the event of a major releae. Southwest Foods Ice Cream has implemented and continues to conduct a preventative maintenance program to ensure that any and all hazards are addressed to reduce the risk of an ammonia release.\nIn the event of a suspected release of Anhydrous Ammonia Southwest Foods Ice Cream has a Pollution Crisis Management and Emergency Response Contingency Plan in place. This plan is updated annually or when ever deemed necessary by Management or the Environmental Health and Safety Coordinator. The plan was developed to protect our partners and community. SouthWest Foods Ice Cream, Supervision, Security, LEPC, Winona Fire Department, and Tyler Hazmat Team all have copies of the Emergency Response Contingency Plan. This plan consist of an emergency notification call down list containing the 24 hour contact numbers for all trained responders, the duties for Ammonia Specialist/Responders, contact information for the LEPC, SERC, NRC, TCEQ, and a MSDS for Anhydrous Ammonia."
