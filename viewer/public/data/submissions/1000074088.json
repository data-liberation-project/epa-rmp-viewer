We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).   The City will not attempt to respond to problems with the chlorine system, but will evacuate the plant and call for local emergency responders to handle the emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.       \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the gaseous chlorine disinfection system at this municipal water filtration plant.  Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance handled at this facility.   The chlorine system has a maximum inventory of 12,750 pounds.  This quantity qualifies the chlorine system as a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nThe Worst-case Scenario.  The worst-case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine tank.  The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be released.  In the worst case scenario this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents onto the ground in ten minutes.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.    \n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a pipe leak.  Based on a 1/16 inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 100 pounds of chlorine during a ten-minute release.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting.  The chlorine system was designed according to appropriate codes and specifications, and adheres to good operating practice.  The operators and contractors who"

We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the chlorine equipment. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History.  The City of Rome Water Filtration Facility has filed two separate incidents that occurred within the last five years.  They occurred on Nov. 19th, 2016 and Nov. 20th 2016.  Both incidents occurred in the same location from the same chlorine container.  On Nov. 19th, there was a problem while switching a 150 lbs. chlorine container out of service. The water filtration facility has been advised by The City of Rome Corp. Counsel, at this point in the investigation the initiating factor and other contributing factors are currently unknown.  All personnel present, followed the emergency response plan and when first responders arrived they were able to install an \"A\" kit on the leaking container to stop the leak.  On Nov. 20th, 2016 an operator was doing their final inspection of the evening, they discovered the chlorine room was filled with chlorine gas through a window.  The investigation that followed the Nov. 20th incident, discovered the seal within the \"A\" kit had failed.  Both incidents combined had an estimated 70 lbs. of chlorine gas released and an estimated 2.4 million dollars of on site property damage.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  On-site operators and employees will not attempt to respond to accidental chlorine releases.  We have coordinated with local emergency responders and will call the emergency responders and evacuate the plant if a chlorine leak occurs.  Emergency responders will inform the public.       \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety.  None outstanding."
