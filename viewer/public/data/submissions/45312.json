This facility conforms with the laws and regulations of the state of Missouri.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has four anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  Two tanks have 18000 gallons water capacity each and two tanks have 12000 gallons water capacity each.  The four storage tanks, several anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks and applicators, risers for filling nurse tanks, electric panels, lighting and safety equipment are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  Though the facility is manned through the year, ammonia is sold to farmers only during the spring and fall use seasons.  The facilty operates with normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \" worst case \" release and  \" alternative \" release scenarios.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of the largest vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \" worst case \" scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tank releasing the entire 85000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off-site consequences were calculated using TFI's DEGADIS Model.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \""

It is estimated that 4300 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \" alternative \" release scenario assumed a hose breaks during transfer and leaks 7200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3 meters per second with a \" D \" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using urban topography because the release would be confined to the within the city, with TFI's DEGADIS Model, the toxic endpoint is 0.46 miles.  The population within that area is estimated to be 3900 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because the equipment, excess flow devices and human intervention will stop the release.  \n\nLincoln County Farmers Coop has had no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia within the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.  Even though the company has had no release it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and procedures for response to a leak.\n\nLincoln County Farmers Coop is in compliance with the provisions of \" Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61 \", published by the American National Standards Institute ( ANSI ), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia \".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\nLincoln County Farmers Coop has a written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.  The company has also provided state and local authorities with the Emergency Action Planning and Community Right to Kn"
