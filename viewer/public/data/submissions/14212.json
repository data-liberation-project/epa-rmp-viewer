It is the goal of the program to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental releases of chemicals used at the facilities, in particular, chlorine gas.\n\n     The program covers the following areas in individual sections:\n          Management System\n          Employee Participation Plan\n          Process Safety Information\n          Process Hazard Analysis\n          Operating Procedures\n          Training\n          Contractor Safety\n          Pre-Startup Safety Review\n          Mechanical Integrity\n          Hot Work Permit\n          Management of Change\n          Incident Investigation\n          Emergency Planning and Response\n          Compliance Audits\n\n     Each of these areas addresses the aspects of controlling the risks associated with the safe handling of chlorine gas at the West Hawaii Faacilities.\n\n     The Management System designates the Utilities Manager as the person with overall responsibility for the program.  The various other responsibilities are shared between the water and wastewater field engineers.\n\n     The Employee Participation Plan designates which employees are to be included in reviewing and implementing the other sections of the plan.  It covers all of the remaining sections.  It includes all employees who may be impacted by the use of the chemicals.\n\n     The Process Safety Information includes procedures for reviewing the accuracy of all process diagrams and piping and instrumentation diagrams.  These are to be reviewed and updated by the Field Engineer - Wastewater with assistance from all operating personnel.\n\n     The Process Hazard Analysis section outlines the methods to be used to evaluate the hazards associated with the use of the chemicals in the processes covered by the program.

It also provides for the continuing training to maintain proficiency in responding to emergencies and safe handling practices.\n\n     The Contractor Safety section addresses the need to communicate the risks and hazards of the chemical processes to any contractors which may be working in or near the area of the chemical use.\n\n     The Prestartup Safety section addresses the need to perform a prestartup inspection before beginning the operation of the chemical feed system, either as an initial startup or restart after repairs.\n\n     The Mechanical Integrity of the equipment and system is to be ensured by the procedures of the Mechanical Integrity section.  This outlines the steps that the Field Engineer - Wastewater and Maintenance Mechanic will follow to ensure that the equipment is always in proper working order and has been maintained as recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n     The Hot Work Permit section describes the need to monitor the hot work, which may be performed in the designated risk areas.  It details the methods to be followed to ensure no damage is done to the chemical system during hot work operations.\n\n     The Mangement of Change section details the procedures to be followed if any process changes or equipment changes are proposed.

It details the procedures for forming a response team and for reviewing and updating the plans.\n\n     The Compliance Safety Audit section covers the procedures to be used by the audit team to review all aspects of the program to ensure compliance with the requirements of the plan.\n\n     All of these sections together comprise the risk management plan for the West Hawaii Utilities.\n\n     The main chemical of concern for the utilities is chlorine gas, which is used as a disinfectant at the resort plant and at well sites for the water system.  The extra cylinders for the wells are stored at the baseyard.\n\n     In completing this plan the worst-case release investigated was for a one-ton cylinder losing all of its contents in 10 minutes at the resort plant.  This would affect an area with a radius of 3.0 miles around the plant.  The alternate release would be a reduced rate leak from a cylinder, most likely caused by the breaking off of a valve.  This release would have a duration of 23 minutes and affect an area with a radius of 0.4 mile from the plant.\n\n     Control and prevention measures which are part of this program include the inspection of all cylinders delivered to the facilities.  The routine servicing of all components of the metering system are also included.\n\n     The most likely time for an accidental release would be during cylinder changing operations.  To reduce this possiblity, all operators are required to wear a self contained breathing apparatus while changing cylinders.  This will allow them to make any  necessary repairs or adjustments to the system immediately without having "

This will reduce possible harm to the attending employees.\n\n     There have been no significant releases from the system over the past five year period.  The above procedures have allowed the immediate repair of two leaking valves with only minimal releases of gas and no employee injuries.\n\n     The plant staff are constantly working to reduce the need for chlorine for disinfection.  It is hoped that in the future the volume needed can be reduced to allow the removal of the ton cylinders and use of 150 pound cylinders in their place."
