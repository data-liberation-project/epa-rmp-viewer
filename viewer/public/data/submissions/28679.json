GEM subscribes to the American Chemistry Counci's voluntary Responsible Care program and abides by the Responsible Care\u00ae Guiding Principles. \n\nSince 1988, the U.S. chemical industry, through the American Chemistry Council, has implemented Responsible Care, a voluntary program to achieve improvements in environmental, health and safety performance beyond levels required by the U.S. government. The program has resulted in significant reductions in releases to air, land and water, major improvements in workplace and community safety, and expanded programs to research and test chemicals for potential health and environmental impacts. Our industry creates products and services that make life better for people around the world \u00bf both today and tomorrow. The benefits of our industry are accompanied by enduring commitments to Responsible Care\u00ae in the management of chemicals worldwide. We will make continuous progress toward the vision of no accidents, injuries or harm to the environment and will publicly report our global health, safety and environmental performance. We will lead our companies in ethical ways that increasingly benefit society, the economy and the environment while adhering to the following principles:\n\nTo seek and incorporate public input regarding our products and operations.\nTo provide chemicals that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of safely.\nTo make health, safety, the environment and resource conservation critical considerations for all new and existing products and processes.\nTo provide information on health or enviro"

Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe GEM Microelectronics, LLC facility is located at 6200 Mumford Road in the City of Bryan Texas.  At the facility, we receive anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF), anhydrous ammonia, and hydrochloric acid via rail and truck.  The hydrogen fluoride and ammonia raw products are then purified through a number of processes and shipped out to customers via rail cars,  trucks, iso containers, or drums.  While the hydrochloric acid raw product is repackaged and shipped to customers. The facility supplies customers with purified hydrofluoric acid (49% to 70% concentration), hydrochloric acid (up to"

Ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and HF are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) present at the Bryan Plant in amounts greater than threshold quantities.  There are no flammable RMP substances present at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals would be the loss of all of the HF in our largest vessel within 10 minutes.  In the case of the Bryan  Plant, this would involve our 12,050 gallon pressurized tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely.  Although we have active mitigation measures in place to prevent such releases (high level/pressure alarms, emergency shutdown, interlocks, deluge systems, and others) and to manage their consequences, the only control taken into account when modeling this scenario was that the release would occur inside a building.  \n\nAs required by EPA, an alternative release scenario which is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario must also be reported for each toxic chemical.  For the Bryan Texas plant  alternative release scenarios were developed for ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and HF, respectively.  Endpoint  distances were developed  based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario. \n\nThe ammonia alternative release scenario is based on a release of ammonia during truck unloading due to an overfill of the ammonia storage vessel.

      "SummaryText": "such an incident occurred and our active mitigation failed, two relief valves on top of the storage vessel would be activated during the filling process.  These valves ensure that the entire vessel does not rupture and only a minor controllable release results.  Excluding any active mitigation measures in the calculations, the 2-inch diameter valves could release the ammonia at a rate of approximately 0.7 tons per minute.  We have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur: \n\n\u00b7\tThe unloading operation is at a pressure (200 psig) that is lower than the established pressure of the relief valves (250 psig).  In other words, the compressor which fills the tank is incapable of delivering a pressure of 250 psig.\n\u00b7\tThe level of liquid ammonia is measured during the filling process and the compressor will automatically shut off should the level reach a high level setpoint. \n\u00b7\tThe unloading operation is monitored by GEM  personnel continuously so that any problems would be detected prior to an overfill of the vessel.\n\u00b7\tFire monitors are available to knock down any vapor that may be released.\n\u00b7\tIf a release of ammonia occurred and the fire water system was implemented, there is secondary containment that would ensure that the resulting wastewater is disposed of properly.\n\t\n\tThe hydrochloric acid alternative release scenario is based on a release of hydrochloric acid through through a 0.5 square inch hole or tear in the truck unloading hose.   Excluding any active mitigation measures in the calculations, the 0.5 square inch hole could release hydrochloric acid at a rate of approximately 1,090 pounds per minute.

If such an incident occurred, HF could be released from the building at a rate of 12.5 pounds per minute.  In calculating this distance, we took credit for the release occurring inside a building, however, we took no credit for any of our other mitigation measures.  We have several active mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur: \n\t\n\u00b7\tThe HF Barn vents to a scrubber system (2 scrubbers in series) which removes vapors at a 99.9% efficiency rate.\n\u00b7\tThe HF Barn is equipped with a vapor detection system.  If vapor is detected, a high concentration alarm is activated.\n\u00b7\tIf a higher concentration is detected by the vapor detection system, an emergency shutdown occurs and a deluge system is activated to absorb vapors in the building.\n\t\n\tThe presence of these active mitigation measures serves to both prevent these scenarios from occurring and minimize their impact if they do occur.  We have discussed these potential ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and HF releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in the City of Bryan and Brazos County, and prepared response plans to further reduce the possibility of any impact on the public.\n\t\n\t\n\tPrevention Program\n\t\n\tThe Bryan  Plant operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

Part of the PSM program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7\tAll processes have a combination of interlocks and emergency shutdowns to ensure cessation of product movement within the plant if a problem were to arise.\n\u00b7\tAll process"
