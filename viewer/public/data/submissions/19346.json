      "SummaryText": "Facility Information:  Columbia Pacific Aluminum Corporation (CPA) is located in the City of Industry, California.  CPA is a producer of extruded aluminum products primarily for industrial use.  CPA's aluminum fabrication facility operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, fifty-two weeks per year.  In order to ensure that their operation schedule is not interrupted, CPA maintains a supply of propane for the facility to use as a secondary fuel in the event the natural gas supply is interrupted.  CPA has taken proactive steps to minimize the potential for an accidental release of propane and other regulated materials stored on the facility.\n\nRegulated Processes and Substances Handled:  The only chemical stored in bulk at CPA where the quantity exceeds the threshold limits defined in 40 CFR Part 68 is propane.  There are a total of three propane tanks, each with a capacity of 30,000 gallons (water capacity).  The tanks are located in the south east corner of CPA's facility.  The maximum fill capacity for each tank is 87 percent or 26,100 gallons.  Each tank is used as a secondary fuel soure at CPA's facility.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:  The worst case release scenario was evaluated as an accident that would instantaneously release a maximum of 331,992 pounds of liquid propane from the three tanks.  Data for this worst case scenario was entered into RMP*Comp Version 1.06.  The RMP*Comp program was developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CAMEO Team to satisfy the Offsite Consequence Analysis requirements of Rule 112(r).  The worst case scenario model predicted a vapor cloud explosion with a 1.0 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure distance of 0.6 miles (0.9 km).  Assumptions for this model included a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour, an \"F\" stability class, and an air temperature of 77degrees fahrenheit.  The emplosion footprint for the CPA propane tank extended beyond "

The worst case scenario indicates that the public near this area could be effected should a worst-case propane explosion occur.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  The most probable alternative release scenario is a vapor cloud fire which would be caused by an assumed 1-square inch leak from process equipment such as valves or piping.  This scenario was modeled using the RMP*Comp Version 1.06 as well.  The model predicted a release rate of 319 lbs/min for the propane assuming a tank pressure of 250 psi (the vent valves are set for 250 psi).  Additional assumptions for this model included a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour, a \"D\" stability class, and an air temperature of 77 degrees fahrenheit.  The alternative release scenario model resulted in a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint distance to the lower flammability limit of 36 mg/L to be<0.1 miles (<0.16 km).  This alternative case release scenario indicates that the public near this facility could be affected should this alternative release scenario occur.\n\nPrevention Program:  CPA has an aggressive accident prevention program and preventive maintenance efforts are in place at the facility to ensure continuous availability of propane and to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release.  Two of the propane tanks were manufactured by Trinity (S/N's 381746, 381747) and the other was manufactured by Chicago Bridge and Iron (S/N 2929).  The 30,000 gallon tanks were purchased and installed in 1972 and are maintained in good condition.  Additionally, routine inspections are conducted to ensure proper maintenance and safe operation of the tanks.\n\nFive Year Accident History: No significant accidents have occured at CPA involving the propane tanks throughout the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The Emergency Response Program at CPA includes a service agreement with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  A significant accident would a"
