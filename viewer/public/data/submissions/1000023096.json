Each vessel can hold up to 10,000 gallons and 6,500 gallons respectively of material. Vessels are located in the tank farm and trailer staging areas. The listed materials are used as feedstock for pilot plant R&D operations. These feedstocks are fed to pilot plant processes by means of pipe at variable rates of 1-300 lbs/hr. Process emissions are controlled by PSVs, rupture disks and a flare. PHAs for site R&D operations include storage vessels (tanks and isotainers).",

We believe occupational illnesses, injuries and environmental incidents are preventable, and their occurrence is unacceptable.  CR&L's objective is to continuously improve health, safety and environmental (HSE) performance and be a recognized leader in industry.  \n\nCR&L's policy is to:\nA?    Operate facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations\nA?    Consider HSE implications during product development, testing, processing and storage\nA?    Devote sufficient resources to be viewed as an industry leader in the area of HSE performance\n\nRisk management (i.e. identifying and managing hazards and potentially adverse effects of activities on people, the environment, assets or reputation) is a vital part of CR&L's HSE program.  CR&L uses a HSE management system to define and manage risks at the site, and ensure operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  The management system has four basic components:\nA?    Identification\nA?    Assessment\nA?    Provision of controls\nA?    Recovery preparedness\nAssessment of risks and hazards considers the full life cycle of an activity from beginning to end.  All steps are documented.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nCR&L's hazard assessment process : \nA?
