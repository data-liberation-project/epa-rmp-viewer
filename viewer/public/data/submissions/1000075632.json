Anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety\r\nDuring a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of WinCo Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of\r\nthe facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate\r\ntraining of our personnel is key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nA written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations is in place at the facility. A crucial component of this plan is an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency\r\nplanning and coordinating with outside parties. Which enables those who deal with emergencies to have a\r\ncourse of action to effectively deal with a release of ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.20 Facility Description and Substances Handled\r\n\r\nWinCo's distribution center is utilized for temporarily storing and transporting grocery products to the\r\nWinCo's network of  grocery stores. The storage of perishable grocery items requires refrigeration\r\nAccess to the facility is restricted to authorized personnel only (employees, management personnel, and contractors). The ammonia refrigeration system at the facility contains approximately 34,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\r\n\r\n1.30 Release Scenario's\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative\r\ncontrols and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each release.

Offsite receptors were defined using Marplot and the 2010 U.S. census information. This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are located within the release radius.\r\n.\r\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWinCo complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and\r\nregulations. The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published codes and standards in place at the time of construction.  WinCo's written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the facility's refrigeration system. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include:  employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor qualifications (safety), pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, Emergency Action and planning, and compliance audits. The plan is reviewed on a regular basis and is updated as necessary by the WinCo's Facility Maintenance Manager.\r\n\r\nTraining is provided to facility personnel to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures and the safety considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.50 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia within the past 5 Years at WinCo's Modesto Distribution Center\r\n\r\n1.60 Emergency Action Plan\r\n\r\n The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in"
