Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  This is exemplified by Huntsman Odessa having earned OSHA VPP STAR status and ISO 14001 certification.  The Huntsman Odessa facility maintains a working PSM program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained workforce.  The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Polymers Odessa participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.  Since its certification in January 1993, the Odessa Site has been an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.\n\n2. Regulated Substances: Huntsman Polymers Odessa is located in Odessa, Texas.  The Odessa site operates five Program Level 3 processes.  These processes receive, handle, and store flammable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of olefins and specialty grade polymers.  End uses include medical and personal care products, electronic cable coatings, adhesives and sealants, as well as boat and vehicle trims.  Huntsman's Odessa site has large volumes of several regulated flammable substances, such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, butane, and butene.  The Odessa site uses small volumes of toxic chemicals, which are consumed in the process.  The toxic chemicals are:\n- Chlorine - Used for water treatment.\n- Vinyl Acetate - Used as a comonomer in the manufacturing of polyethylene.\n- Hydrochloric Acid - Used for water treatment. \n\n4.

The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training in accordance with applicable standards.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nHuntsman Odessa has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing, and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nHuntsman Odessa has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to site personnel, process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety, health, and the environment, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Associates involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract associates whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\nHuntsman Odessa performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

Teams comprised of associates, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and tracked until resolved.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nHuntsman Odessa investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could possibly have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Odessa utilizes a team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that address the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the investigation.  Huntsman Odessa established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings, recommendations, and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are reviewed with all affected personnel.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nHuntsman Odessa has developed a written action plan for associate participation in all aspects of its process safety management program.
