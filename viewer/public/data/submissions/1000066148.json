(hereafter referred to as LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressurized railcars. The LPG is transferred to storage vessels via transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage vessel.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage vessels via loading stations.  Transfer if driven using fixed facility equipment for all transfer operations except those involving the truck stations in the north east of the facility. Transfer to and from those stations is powered by the truck pumps. For modeling purposes, the flammable mixture was modeled as butane, the component of greatest consequence.\r\n\r\nEmergency Contacts\r\nThere are two Crestwood employees who serve as the primary emergency contacts during off hours: the Terminal Supervisor and the Senior Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Adviser. Both employees can be reached 24 hours per day and are local to the facility.\r\nEmergency planning has started with the local fire department and Office of Emergency Management. An environmental cleanup company is under contract to provide additional assistance in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation Plan\r\nThe written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees are involved in the overall risk management plan. There is a copy of the written plan in the office. The Terminal Supervisor is charged with implementing the plan."

There is a daily tool box meeting covering environmental, safety, and health issues at which any questions or suggestions regarding risk management can be raised.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe required Process Safety Information has been accumulated by the Engineering Department, is stored on site, and is available to employees. The process safety information was also available during the completion of the process hazard analysis. The Terminal Supervisor is responsible for maintaining the process safety information.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe initial process hazard analysis using the HAZOP methodology was completed on January 7, 2013. The process hazard analysis was revalidated June 6, 2017. The process hazard analysis and list of recommendations are stored on site.
