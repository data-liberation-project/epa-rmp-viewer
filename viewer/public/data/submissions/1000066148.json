(hereafter referred to as LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressurized railcars. The LPG is transferred to storage vessels via transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage vessel.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage vessels via loading stations.  Transfer if driven using fixed facility equipment for all transfer operations except those involving the truck stations in the north east of the facility. Transfer to and from those stations is powered by the truck pumps. For modeling purposes, the flammable mixture was modeled as butane, the component of greatest consequence.\n\n\n\nEmergency Contacts\n\nThere are two Crestwood employees who serve as the primary emergency contacts during off hours: the Terminal Supervisor and the Senior Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Adviser. Both employees can be reached 24 hours per day and are local to the facility.\n\nEmergency planning has started with the local fire department and Office of Emergency Management. An environmental cleanup company is under contract to provide additional assistance in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\n\nThe written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees are involved in the overall risk management plan. There is a copy of the written plan in the office. The Terminal Supervisor is charged with implementing the plan. "

Additionally, the Terminal Supervisor maintains an open door policy, and the operators may make suggestions at any time. There is a daily \"tool box\" meeting covering environmental, safety, and health issues at which any questions or suggestions regarding risk management can be raised.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe required Process Safety Information has been accumulated by the Engineering Department, is stored on site, and is available to employees. The process safety information was also available during the completion of the process hazard analysis. The Terminal Supervisor is responsible for maintaining the process safety information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe initial process hazard analysis using the HAZOP methodology was completed on January 7, 2013. The process hazard analysis was revalidated June 6, 2017. The process hazard analysis and list of recommendations are stored on site. The Terminal Supervisor is responsible for resolving the recommendations.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nComprehensive operating procedures have been developed by a team of Crestwood employees. The procedures include all of the operations covered by the regulation. There is a procedure outlining how the operating procedures will be reviewed annually to ensure they are current and updated as necessary to reflect current conditions. The written operating procedures are maintained on site, and the Terminal Supervisor has the responsibility of maintaining them.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEmployees have been trained and tested as required by the training procedure. Training was performed in both the classroom and on the job formats. Testing includes written tests, oral exams, and demonstration.

The program includes: procedures for selecting contractors based on their safety and health performance and safety and health systems; a background check of both the contractor company as well as the individual contractor employee(s) that will work at the facility; an annual training program covering applicable risk management program training, as well as safety and health and emergency information; an annual written test with a required minimum passing score of 80%; and a contractor auditing procedure to ensure contractors are working in compliance with Crestwood requirements while on site. The Environmental safety and Regulatory Group is responsible for selecting contractors to work on site and ensure the background checks are completed.
