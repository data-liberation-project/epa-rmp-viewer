Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFlexitank, Inc. is a privately held, logistics company located in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. We are committed to operating and maintaining in a safe and responsible manner all processes related to bulk chemical transportation and storage. Flexitank complies with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All Flexitank employees are informed of hazards in the workplace and are trained accordingly. Flexitank has procedures in place in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release was to occur, these procedures include but are not limited to the activation of emergency notification and response to ensure the safety of our employees, the community, the environment, and the property.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nFlexitank is an NVOCC (OTI) that specializes in logistics management. We occasionally store ISO-tanks containing chemical products for our customers as an \"added value\" service in our Depot Facilities located on the Zona Portuaria in San Juan. \n\n\n\nFlexitank Depot receives the bulk liquid cargo by the following modes of transportation: tank trucks, ISO tank containers, and flexi-bags (no hazardous products only). The received cargo is stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and it is subsequently dispatched on the same transportation modes as originally received. Flexitank, Inc. does not perform any chemical processing, manufacturing, or product transfer to intermediate storage containers. \n\n\n\nThe following Regulated Toxic Substances are occasionally stored at Flexitank Depot facility and have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant consequences  in the event of a substantial accidental release: \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7)\n\n\n\nOur Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) include, but are not limited to, Emergency response and contingency plan"

General Prevention Program and Regulated Substances Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nActions to prevent the recurrence or spread of fires, explosions, or releases include stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released material, and recovering or isolating containers. In addition, if the facility stops operations in response to an emergency, the Emergency Coordinator will monitor valves, pipes, and other equipment for leaks, pressure build-up, gas generation, or ruptures.\n\n\n\nThe information contained in this program has been prepared following the requirements for a Prevention, Preparedness, and Contingency Plan as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 265.50 through 265.56, as well as any applicable Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws, rules, and regulations. Also, elements of Emergency Response Plans (in accordance with EPCRA requirements), and of Risk Management Plans (40 CFR 63) have been incorporated to minimize hazards to human health or the environment resulting from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials or any of its constituents to the air, soil or surface water.\n\n\n\nThe hazardous materials storage facilities are inspected on a weekly basis. The inspection forms include a written checklist to be followed during the inspection. The facilities are inspected for signs posted, safety features, liquid level, tank or container identification, ruptures, corrosion, leaks, conditions of vents, integrity of dikes, materials inside dikes, and others. Any deficiency is immediately reported and corrective actions are taken as soon as possible. Records are maintained until the next internal inspection is conducted or five years have passed, whichever is longest.\n\n\n\nAll fire extinguishers must comply w"

Any operational personnel that will be involved in any way in the response to an incident involving hazardous materials, waste, or substances must receive the appropriate training.\n\n\n\nThe following trainings are taken by the appropriate personnel:\n\n\n\n?    24-hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (First Responder Operations Level Course) - Personnel that will help in the control of the incident but that will not apply defensive measures to control the spill.\n\n?    40-hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (Hazardous Materials Technician Course) - Personnel that will actually become in contact with the spilled material and that will employ defensive strategies in order to stop the release.

Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nFlexitank performed a worst-case release scenario analysis to identify the potential reach and effect of hypothetical worst-case accidental release for each toxic and flammable substance held above the applicable threshold quantity in the process, that if released under worst-case conditions, would potentially affect the largest geographical area around the facility and public receptors.\n\n\n\nAlso, Flexitank performed alternative release scenario analysis to identify the potential reach and effect of hypothetical accidental releases under more realistic circumstances and identify and analyze reasonable release scenarios that are more likely to occur than worst-case release scenarios and that reach an off-site endpoint.\n\n\n\n5.
