The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Western Illinois Grain Co. Are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Colchester Fire Dept. Of the County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\n\nThe maximum quanity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 140106 lbs. The maximum quantity handled in the largest tank would be the 1-30,000 gal. Ammonia Storage Tank holding 140196 pounds.\n\n3.The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\n\nWorse-Case: The worse-case scenario would be the total contents of a storage tank (or rail tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 140196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles, which would encompass an area of 8.04 sq. Miles with the potential of impacting approximately 2500souls in the surrounding area.\n\nAlternative Case:  The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 2 inch Diameter transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.6 miles, which would encompass an area of 1.13 sq.miles, with the potential of impacting approximately 1500 souls in the surrounding area.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requiremen"

And the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia (from our fixed sources) in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility: nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damages.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place and has coordinated this program with the Colchester Fire Department and with McDonough Co. LEPC. We train our staff on the elements found in our response program (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120) and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. This facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
