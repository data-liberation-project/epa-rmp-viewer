The combined stream is sent through to the next process step.\n\nThe next step in the overall process uses Greyrock\u0092s proprietary Liquid Fuel Production process and GreyCat\u00ae catalyst technology to convert the syngas into drop-in, liquid hydrocarbon transportation fuels.\n\nThis Liquid Fuels Production (LFP) process also produces a Tail-gas composed of unconverted syngas plus the non-condensable hydrocarbon and gaseous components produced by the catalyst (e.g., methane, ethane, carbon dioxide). A portion of this tail gas is recycled to the LFP reactor for additional conversion with some purged to fuel for the furnace used to heat the gases.\n\n \n\nThe Infinium Corpus Christi facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Net Zero Carbon One, LLC identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Infinium Corpus Christi facility are a mixed hydrocarbon product containing 1-butene, 1-pentene, 2-methyl-1-buten, butane, pentane and propane as well as additional heavier hydrocarbons, which may be sold as a blended product or distilled on site to produce eNaphtha containing these same constituents.\n\nThe Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials to report. \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Net Zero Carbon One, LLC to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Infinium Corpus Christi facility is located at 1202 McBride Lane, Corpus Christi, Texas in Nueces County and is owned by Net Zero Carbon One, LLC and operated by Infinium Operations, LLC.\n\nThe Infinium Corpus Christi facility \n\nThe Infinium Electrofuels technology converts carbon dioxide and water into drop-in, liquid hydrocarbon transportation fuels through a series of reactions using proprietary catalysts.\n\nThe first step is the production of hydrogen from water using electric energy as a motive force. The facility has two installed 5MW electrolyzers, one that is based on alkaline technology and the second based on PEM technology.\n \nThe second step uses a catalytic  reaction to convert a) carbon dioxide which is delivered to the site in liquid form and then vaporized prior to use or alternatively delivered in gaseous form over the fence from a third party, and b) hydrogen which is delivered by on site electrolysis or alternatively delivered in gaseous form over the fence from a third party) into carbon monoxide and water. This reaction is effected in the presence of a  proprietary catalyst that enables the efficient and stable conversion of carbon dioxide at temperature and pressure. After c"
