      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Wauna Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the Wauna Mill workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Wauna Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.  This revision is also intended to meet the regulatory requirement mandating the review and update of the RM Plan every five (5) years.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule\n \n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes)\n \n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Wauna Mill. In fact, the facility has a comprehensi"

When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe Wauna Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility works with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at The Wauna Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Wauna Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the en"

The Wauna Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President/Mill Manager.\n\n\n1.2 The FJ/Wauna Mill and Its Regulated Substances\n\nThe FJ/Wauna Mill is located on 1200 acres adjacent to the Columbia River in Clatsop County, Oregon.  The mill is a fully integrated pulp and paper mill that produces a variety of paper products.  These products include towel and tissue products for retail stores and the commercial market, and uncoated printing papers. \n\nAs part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores chlorine dioxide (C102) for use in the bleaching process. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.\n\nIn addition, the facility stores and uses anhydrous ammonia to as a requirement to reduce emissions from one of the facility\u00bfs boilers.  The ammonia system, which includes the storage and distribution of ammonia, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.\n\n\nChlorine Dioxide Generator and Associated Chlorine Dioxide Storage:  An R8 process is used to generate chlorine dioxide on-site for subsequent use in the kraft bleach plant.  In this process, methanol is added to a heated solution of sodium chlorate and sulfuric acid in a reaction vessel which is under a vacuum.  The resultant chlorine dioxide gas is absorbed in cold water and then stored as a nominal 1% solution.  The maximum chlorine dioxide solution strength could be as high as 1.4%.  \n\nFluid Bed Boiler NOx Control and Associated Ammonia Storage:  The Fluid Bed Boiler at Wauna uses ammonia injection as part of its Fluid Bed Boiler (FBB)"

Liquid ammonia is purchased and stored on-site.  From the storage tank, ammonia is added to the mill's fluid bed boiler as needed to control emissions.\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n \nWauna Mill has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n \n1.4.1 Program Level 3 Prevention Program\n \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Wauna Mill Program Level 3 Prevention Program that addresses the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n \n1. Employee Participation The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of The Wauna Mill employees are addressed. The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n \n2. Process Safety Information The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes.

The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all the Wauna Mill employees, and local emergency responders. All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained at the facility.  Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, including non-regulated substances in the covered process. MSDS's for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the control rooms so the operators have ready reference to this information. In addition, MSDS's are provided to the Plant Emergency Response teams and local emergency responders for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.  \n \nMany of the operating parameters are included in the technology information to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazard analysis, and (3) to help maintain the equipment to the design specification.\n \n3. Process Hazard Analysis.  The Wauna Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If'\" technique, supplemented with checklist, to perform this analysis. The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including recommendations. Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety"
