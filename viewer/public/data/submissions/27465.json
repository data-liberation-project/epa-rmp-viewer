      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt the Martin Resources, LLC (Martin) Plainview, Texas facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered a hazardous toxic gas by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Plainview Fire Department to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nWe at the Martin use anhydrous ammonia in the manufacturing of ammonium sulfate, fertilizer pellets, and liquid fertilizers. Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to our facility via rail car or truck transport and is stored in aboveground storage tanks at the facility prior to process use. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is administratively limited to 89% of the facility?s capacity.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at our facility is anhydrous ammonia.

The entire contents of the tank are assumed to be released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  Passive mitigation measures (e.g., enclosures) may be taken into account. The toxic endpoint is the threshold for serious injury from exposure to a toxic substance in the air.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur. In reality, a vapor release would not occur; some quantity of anhydrous ammonia would remain in liquid form. During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility?s mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp? the EPA recommended software. The toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 milligrams/liter (mg/L) or 200 parts per million (PPM). Based on 270,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 8.9 miles from the location of the storage tank.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur at the facility is the failure of a flexible liquid transfer hose while transferring anhydr"

Excess flow valves at the storage tanks and rail car function to stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia out of the storage tank and rail car. Therefore, the anhydrous ammonia released would be limited to 600 pounds, the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the transfer hose and iron piping between the rail car and the facility's storage tanks. \n\nThe entire contents of the flexible transfer hose and iron piping will be released within the estimated time it would take facility personnel to identify a failure and implement actions to stop the release.  RMP*Comp? estimates the distance to the point of dispersion to 200 PPM or to disperse enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.5-mile.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMartin complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)?s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA?s Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules and with all applicable state codes and regulations. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. Additionally, our facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of 29 CFR Part 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMartin maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur personnel conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with "
