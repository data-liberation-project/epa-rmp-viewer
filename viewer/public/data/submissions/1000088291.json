              "Description": "COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has installed multiple safeguards and systems to reduce the likelihood of ammonia incidents, including:\n\n* Equipment is designed and built to national standards for ammonia service.\n\n* The system is equipped with instrumentation that controls the operation within safe limits.\n\n* Emergency shutdown systems are installed to immediately isolate the system and minimize upsets.\n\n* Storage tanks, pumps, and compressors curbed and located in a partial shed to reduce the rate of release to the outside air.\n\n* Ammonia detectors are installed at key locations to provide early warning of potential problems.\n\n*Relief devices prevent overpressure of the system and will safely discharge the material should an upset occur.\n\n\n\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS has established programs and activities to ensure safe operation of its ammonia system. Some examples include:\n\n* Production and maintenance personnel are trained in the safe operation and repair of the system.\n\n* Written operating and maintenance procedures are in place and updated regularly.\n\n* Full in-depth hazard and operability studies are conducted by qualified personnel at least every five years.\n\n* Complete safety reviews are conducted prior to making any changes to the operation or equipment.\n\n* Health, environmental, and safety audits are conducted at least every 3 years to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\n* Maintenance work is planned ahead of time and work permits issued to assure work is performed safely.\n\n*Regular inspection of equipment, instruments, and piping are conducted to assure integrity of the system.\n\n* Scheduled preventative maintenance work is performed to assure equipment is safe, reliable, and efficient.\n\n* All incidents are investigated and actions are taken to prevent reoccurrence.\n\n\n\nCOOPER RIVER PARTNERS trains employees on the safe handling of ammonia and how to respond appropriately, should a release occur. Preparation and training includes:\n\n* Written procedures to handle all types of emergencies.\n\n* Regularly scheduled safety training for operators and maintenance personnel responsible for the ammonia system.\n\n* Trained and experienced on-site emergency response teams (Fire & Rescue, EMS, and Hazmat).\n\n* Emergency planning with the local fire department and county emergency preparedness personnel.\n\n* Planning and training with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and participation in annual drills.\n\n* Routine testing of plant emergency response, alerting, and communications systems.\n\n* Fully equipped emergency response vehicles (fire truck, ambulance, and hazmat truck).\n\n* Emergency response personnel trained annually at nationally recognized schools.\n\n* Certified Hazmat Team to respond to off-site transortaqtion and distribution incidents.\n\n",

In addition, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS's site emergency plans have been integrated with the emergency plans of the county and local fire departments. COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has participated in every disaster drill\n\nheld annually by the LEPC.\n\n\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\nAt COOPER RIVER PARTNERS, we work with the citizens of our community to help protect and improve the quality of life we all enjoy. Protection of our employees and neighbors is our highest priority, and that is why we have installed multiple safeguards to ensure that all chemicals are handled safely. We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks. In keeping with our commitment, COOPER RIVER PARTNERS has developed a risk management plan in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases. Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nCRP is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119. PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment. The COOPER RIVER PARTNERS Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.\n\n\n\nIII.

      "SummaryText": "ted in 40 CFR Part 68. The RMP includes COOPER RIVER PARTNERs ammonia refrigeration system and ISO storage of trimethylchlorosilane. The Ammonia system contains liquefied gas under pressure, and is regulated as a toxic substance. The site stores ISO vessels containing trimethylchlorosilane, which is also regulated as a toxic substance.The COOPER RIVER PARTNERS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nCRP uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the plant-wide refrigeration system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat. Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\n\n\nCRP also provides interim short-term storage of trimethylchlorosilane, pending shipment to its final destination. Predictive Filing has been selected since the actual quantity stored on-site at any one time will vary. Trans-loading operations are performed solely by a knowledgeable and trained third-party contractor. However, trans-loading operations are included in this RMP to ensure all risks are appropriately addressed.\n\n\n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nA worst case and alternative case scenario is included in the plan for ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane. \n\n\n\nToxic end-point or Level of Concern (LOC)\n\nThe Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 - Level of Concern (ERPG2-LOC) is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or serious health effects, or symptoms which impair their ability to take protective action. The release impact distance is the distance down wind to the ERPG2-LOC concentration. The ERPG2-LOC for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L and the EHS-LOC for Trimethylchlorosilane is 0.05 mg/L.\n\n\n\nThe Extremely Hazardous Substance Level of Concern (EHS-LOC) is the airborne concentration 10 times safer "
