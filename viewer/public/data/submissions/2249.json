Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at City of Tomball Waste Water Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with City of Tomball Police Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Treatment of wastewater for the City of Tomball.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Chlorine is used for the disinfection of wastewater.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 6000.00 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Comp, Ver. 1.06, taking into account process area detectors.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Wastewater Treatment Plant.
