The facility uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant and have several rooms in the facility that use the system including production and storage areas. The RMP-regulated process at the facility consists of ammonia refrigeration system which includes high pressure storage vessel, evaporators, condensers and associated piping. The facility has determined that RMP program level 3 would apply based on the worst case scenario which determined that public receptors are within the distance to the end point. Further, the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management(PSM) program.\n\n2. It is company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local regulations. The management of the facility regards employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working and public environments. Frick's Quality Meats is a non-responding facility and will call 911 to report an ammonia release.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility complies with the OSHA PSM rules.Employees are trained to recognize the hazards of ammonia process and all changes to the process are reviewed to insure that the safety, health and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to making the change. This facility has a strong commitment to the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia and to minimize the probability of an accidental release. This is achieved through a combination of safety equipment, personnel training and operating procedures. The safety equipment includes pressure relief devices, ammonia detectors, manual/automatic shut-offs, alarms and sprinkler system. The Franklin County LEPC is notified annually about presence of anhydrous ammonia at the facility through submission of Tier II reports.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThi"
