The risk management program has been in place since 1988 and includes process safety information according to a documentation plan. \n\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted on a five year schedule by the Hazard Analysis Team (Team).  The Team is composed of members of the Environmental Resources Department, members of the engineering staff, operations and/or maintenance supervisors or other members of the Facilities Maintenance and Production Departments, and technical consultants as necessary.  The results are compiled in a written report and the recommendations are tracked by the Environmental Resources Department.\n\nThe Manager-Production is directly responsible for preparing, communicating, and maintaining standard operating procedures (SOP's).  This person is responsible for preparing SOP's, maintaining the SOP master file and current index, ensuring that SOP's and changes are communicated to operators, conducting annual reviews of the procedures, and generating and incorporating modifications to SOP's.  Written standard operating procedures are kept in the System Control Room, the Plant Control Room, the Environmental Resources Central File, the office of the Managing Director - System Operations, Facilities Maintenance, and Technical Support, and various supervisors' offices.  \n\nResponsibility for the Operator Training Program resides with the Manager - Production.  Written training materials include the Chemical Safety Training Handbook and the Haworth Water Treatment Plant Emergency Response Plan.  The Operator Training Program requires on-the-job training in addition to annual classroom training.  At the end of the classroom training written tests and oral examinations are used to ensure an understanding of"

The program consists of 1) periodic inspection, testing, and servicing of equipment, and 2) procedures for recording repairs, approved modifications, and replacement of equipment.  The facility maintains an inventory list of all equipment in service.  Documentation and drawings that are necessary for proper servicing of equipment are part of the preventive maintenance program.  The program also includes training of preventive maintenance personnel.  The HSB database is used to implement and document the program.  Equipment maintenance history is analyzed for task completion on a periodic basis by the Manager - Environmental Resources.  Lock-out/tag-out, confined space entry permits, and hot work permits have been incorporated in the program.\n\nThe Management of Change program is a written program that is assured by the Managing Director - System Operations, Facilities Maintenance, and Technical Support.  All changes are described in a written report which must be approved and authorized by the Managing Director - System Operations, Facilities Maintenance, and Technical Support.  The reports are maintained in the Environmental Resources Central File.  Temporary changes are also addressed by this program.\n\nThe Manager - Environmental Resources is responsible for the written pre-startup Safety Review and the written Compliance Audit programs.  The review/audit is performed by members of the Environmental Resources Department, operations/maintenance/production supervisors/staff, and/or technical consultants as necessary.
