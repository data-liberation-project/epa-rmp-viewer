This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program covering areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and personnel training associated with the processes at CCC/GAR.  It is CCC/GARA\u00bfs policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, CCC has an emergency plan in place coordinated with the Hannibal Rural Fire Department, City of Hannibal Fire Department, and Ralls/Marion County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These local agencies provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\r\n\r\nRMP comp provided evidence that CCC/GAR does not have a public receptor within the distance to endpoint determined from a worst-case scenario release.  Additionally, no accidents with specific offsite consequences have occurred at the facility within the past five years.  CCC/GAR processes flammable solvents as an alternative fuel source in heating the kiln and 40 CFR 68.126 provides a fuel exemption stating, \"A flammable substance listed in Tables 3 and 4 of 68.130 is nevertheless excluded from all provisions for this part when the substance is used as a fuel\".  For the reasons detailed above, CCC/GAR will not include acetaldehyde and ethyl ether which were included in the previous presumptive filing in 2014 and will exclude those flammable chemicals to file as a level 1 RMP facility.\r\n \r\n2.0\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nCCC is a Portland cement manufacturer located approximately 3 miles"

      "SummaryText": "south of downtown Hannibal, Missouri.  The original cement manufacturing facility was constructed in 1905.  The facility was continuously upgraded and enlarged to its current capacity.  The dry rotary cement kiln system currently online was erected in 2008.  In 1986, CCC was granted interim status under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to operate an alternative WDF facility (GAR).  A mixture of various substances, regulated as hazardous waste primarily due to flammability, are received, stored and prepared for use as alternative WDF in the cement kiln system.  The alternative WDF burns cleaner than coal and serve as a direct replacement of coal.  The alternative WDF consists of spent products such as paints, inks, solvents, oil, and other flammable or combustible organic materials.   Both solid and liquid alternative WDF are received at CCC/GAR.\r\n\r\nCCC/GAR tests the WDF regularly to determine concentrations and quantities of regulated substances as defined by the facilities permit.  Therefore, CCC/GAR has based this Level 1 Risk Management Plan on the storage and processing of chloroform, vinyl acetate, and formaldehyde.  \r\n \r\n3.0\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Include Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario. To evaluate the worst-case scenarios, CCC/GAR used a consulting firm, RMP comp software and EPA regulations obtained in 40 CFR 68.\r\n \r\nThe RMP is based upon Alternative Waste-Derived Liquid Fuels Blending and Storage as a Program 1 process.  The worst case scenario considered for this process involves the  toxic substances Chloroform, Formaldehyde, and Vinyl Acetate.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThe worst-case scenario considered for the toxic substances utilizes releases of the toxic substances with passive mitigation (diked area smaller than maximum area) and are as follows: Chloroform distance to endpoint of 0.4 mile; Formaldehyde distance to endpoint of 0.2"

These distances are less than the distance, .55 mile, to the nearest public receptor.  \r\n \r\n \r\n4.0\tFive-year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances at CCC/GAR within the last five (5) years that have led to offsite deaths, injuries, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.    \r\n \r\n5.0\tEmergency Response Plan Program\r\nCCC/GAR has coordinated an emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials, fires and explosions.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n \r\nTo ensure proper functioning, the facilities emergency response equipment is inspected and serviced periodically.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes requiring a modified emergency response.\r\n \r\nRalls/Marion County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the facilities emergency plan has been discussed and coordinated.  CCC/GAR is an active member of the LEPC.\r\n\r\n6.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCCC/GAR has made several modifications to its process to improve safety.  CCC/GAR has raised six storage tanks located in the alternative liquid WDF blending and storage facility.  The purpose of raising the tanks is to allow for tank bottom inspection and enhanced leak detection.  Other process improvements include the installation of double mechanical seals on existing pumps and the replacement of fuel straining equipment with in-line grinding units.  These improvements reduce the occurrence of leaks and fugitive emissions from the process equipment.  All of the changes have the approval of EPA/MDNR. \r\n\r\nCCC/GAR has proposed no other changes to impro"
