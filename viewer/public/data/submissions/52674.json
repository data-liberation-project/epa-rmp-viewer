ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\n\nAt Schwan\u00bfs Global Supply Chain of Stiwell, OK, we utilize anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Schwan\u00bfs strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Stilwell Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the production of frozen foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nSchwan\u00bfs has three independent systems at this site.  The regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia. The largest system contains 54,000 pounds of ammonia.  The maximum total amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 113,000 pounds.  We have the capacity for 122,000 pounds but our written policy limits our storage to 80% of total capacity.\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "ELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S), INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of our largest receiver.  Schwan\u00bfs policy restricts the maximum capacity of this 7,555 pound tank to 80% of capacity.  The greatest amount stored in that tank is 6,063 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).  \nDistance to endpoint: 0.87 miles (1,536 yards)\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to the failure of a pressure release valve.  The emergency valves shut-down release would engage and stop the flow or the monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 34 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 1,168 pounds of ammonia.  \nDistance to endpoint:  0.08 miles (141 yards)\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\nTo date, this Schwan\u00bfs facility has had no reportable releases.  \n\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Mr. David Anderson, Environmental and Safety Manager.  Mr. Anderson will administrate in conjunction with the Schwan\u00bfs management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Stilwell Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThe Schwan\u00bfs facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom training plus On-The-Job (OTJ) training.  They are able to demon"
