If the facility is modified, the Emergency Response Plan (ICP) is updated as needed to include any new refinery units and changes to operations and facility personnel are informed of the change(s). \n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\nThe Refinery Manager is ultimately responsible for implementation of the risk management measures set forth in this document. The PSM Lead is responsible for upkeep of the Risk Management Plan and Hazard Assessment, and all supporting documentation. The individual departments assigned above implement each element of the Prevention Program.\n\nENHANCEMENTS TO SAFETY\nPhillips 66 is committed to the continuous improvement of safety at the Ferndale Refinery. The use of prevention programs required by RMP (including PHAs, incident investigations, audits, and testing and inspection results), as well as other safety and risk reduction initiatives, ensure that the necessary modifications are implemented to maintain and enhance safety at the facility.\n \nThe following are examples of the types of safety-enhancing modifications made to the facility during the period from 2018 to 2023:\n1. Additional improvements have been made to pumps and compressors to prevent seal failures, such as pump replacements, seal modifications, safety interlocks, etc.\n2.

The facility is a responsible member of the community by protecting the refinery and neighbors from damaging effects of emergency situations. The facility design, maintenance, operating procedures, and training provide for risk minimization should an accident occur. In spite of all these things, emergencies can arise, sometimes through forces beyond our control. The facility emergency response plan known as the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), along with training and drills, is designed to prepare the facility to recognize emergency situations of various types and react promptly and correctly to minimize any ill effects. Local, state, and federal safety rules dictate that the facility study and understand the principles and specifics covered in this preplanning effort and fully understand all roles in the plan. Local, state, and federal emergency planning and response organizations are provided a copy of the ICP.\n\nThe purpose of this emergency plan (ICP) is to provide a cohesive, written procedure for coordinating an effective response by all refinery personnel so that danger to employees, contractors, the general public, and the environment may be lessened in the unlikely event of an emergency. The emergency response procedure covers the entire facility, including refinery units that don\u2019t handle or produce regulated substances. It includes but is not limited to: first-in response, evacuation, emergency shutdown, decontamination and medical response to chemical exposure, agency notification, public notification if potential for impact, personnel accounting, and clean-up.\n\nTraining for emergency response is handled through the HSE Department, and is conducted frequently with classroom, tabletop, and field exercises.

In addition to incidents that have the potential to result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance, it also covers all other incidents and near misses that occur at the refinery. Examples include, but are not limited to: process safety incidents, occupational injuries and illness, unit upsets, production loss, property damage or loss, and environmental incidents such as spills or releases. Incident investigation is the responsibility of the PSM Lead.\n\nThe intent is to ensure that investigations are conducted in a timely, organized, and objective manner. The purpose of an investigation is not to fix blame, but rather to determine the facts surrounding the incident, present the findings and conclusions, and make recommendations for corrective actions that will prevent a similar occurrence in the future. An incident investigation team will investigate all incidents as defined in Section 68.81 of the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\nAll process safety near misses and incidents are reviewed during the 5-year revalidation of the unit PHA studies, to provide the PHA team with insight into hazards that may occur.\n\nPP12.\tCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ferndale Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.\n\nThis facility verifies RMP compliance every three years with an audit.

It receives crude oil from multiple sources, which it processes into petroleum products, including gasoline, transportation fuels, LPG, and oils. In addition to the flammable materials associated with crude oil processing, the facility uses hydrofluoric acid in the Alkylation Unit, which is a standard refining application. The processing of the crude oil results in the generation of hydrogen sulfide. Sulfur Recovery Units process the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to recover sulfur for sale and to limit SO2 and CO2 emissions to atmosphere at quantities below the allowable limits. \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe federal Risk Management Program requires the Phillips 66 Ferndale Refinery to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any processes containing regulated substances above their threshold quantities (TQ) at the Ferndale Refinery. The Ferndale Refinery handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect its employees and contractors, the surrounding community, and the environment. The facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, to plan for emergencies, and to maintain the equipment needed if an emergency does occur. The RMP summarizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\nThe Ferndale Refinery processes oil into gasoline and refining products. The facility receives oil from many sources via ship, pipeline, and rail, stores it in tanks onsite, and then processes the oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, barge, or truck. The refining process separates the crude oil into five products: gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), heavy fuel oil, and sulfur. All products are stored onsite prior to shipment.
