Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nNestle Professional Beverages has long been committed to maintaining a high degree of employee safety and community relations.  To these ends, the facility maintains an active safety management program to prevent releases of ammonia.  The facility's overall approach to safety is the prevention of accidents, and emphasis on safe work practices.  A planned schedule of inspection and maintenance activities, augmented by worker training, is intended to prevent accidents and releases.  A system of automatic detection and alarm devices is employed to give early warning of releases.  The facility manually integrates alarm situations with off-site response providers, such as Siemens Life System, and the Chicago Fire Department.\r\n\r\nSenior management remains committed to this program of safety and safe procedures.  The implementation of safe working procedures and chemical safety is directed at the level of Vice President, who is responsible for corporate policy and facility compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nNestle Professional Beverages is a food manufacturer engaged in the blending and packaging of a variety of beverages in food service packages.  Located at the boundary between an industrial area and a residential area, the facility imports by truck a variety of juice concentrates and blends them into finished products.  Packaging materials, wrapping, and shipping materials are also brought to the site.\r\n\r\nThe need to keep raw materials and finished products refrigerated or frozen requires a large refrigeration capacity.   To supply the demand for this refrigeration capacity, the facility operates an in-plant anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  This refrigeration plant was upgraded in 2011.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only regulated substance handled at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.
