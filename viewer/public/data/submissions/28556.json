The City of Arcadia Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) facility was installed to treat wastewater for Desoto County, City of Arcadia service subscribers.  The facility is located at 223 South Parker Avenue (27?13?03? North Latitude and 81?52?27? West Longitude) and includes a chlorine storage area containing liquid chlorine containers, chlorinators, and various types of related safety equipment as well as process treatment tanks and equipment.  A maximum of four (4) one-ton containers of chlorine are found in the chlorine storage area (two on-line and two for backup.)  The facility is staff 16 hours a day 7 days a week on site with on-call coverage 24 hours a day, and qualifies as a Program 3 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\nb.    The City of Arcadia accidental release prevention program at the Parker Avenue facility involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and adheres to all applicable procedures of EPA.  The City of Arcadia emergency response program is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program (?ERP?) requirements.\n\nc.    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as ?worst-case release? and ?alternative release.?  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, ?the owner or operator shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as a gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.?\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by EPA of 3 parts per million (?ppm?), whic                                                                                                                                             "
