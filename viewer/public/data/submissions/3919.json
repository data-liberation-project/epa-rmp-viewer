      "SummaryText": "\n\nAjinomoto USA Inc.  uses ammonia in its fermentation processing as a source of nitrogen and pH\ncontrol.\n\nThis facility complies with all applicable OSHA requirements for storage and handling of\nof anhydrous ammonia.\n\nOur worst case scenario involves the failure of one 30,000 gallon tank of ammonia, filled to the \ngreatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud.  According to the EPA look-up tables\nthe distance to endpoint would be 4.4 miles.  Within that radius is a population of 1,000 people.\nThis includes the City of Eddyville, which is to the northeast of the facility.\n\nOur alternative release scenario involves a smaller release, from the failure of a transfer hose,\nused in delivery unloading.  This would result in a vapor cloud, of a smaller size.  According to\nthe EPA look-up tables the distance to endpoint would be 0.7 miles.  The population density in\nthis radius would be 28 people living in residences.\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA accident prevention rule, all applicable state and local codes\nand regulations.  The ammonia system is installed to all regulations required and is regularly\ninspected and maintained for safe operation.\n\nSince the startup of this facility, there has never been a reportable release of ammonia from this\ntank causing injury, death, environmental or property damage.\n\nAjinomoto USA, Inc.  has emergency response procedures in the event of a situation such as \ndiscussed above.  In the event of an emergency with our ammonia system, it is our policy to\ncontact the Eddyville Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  This policy is\ncommunicated to all employees at this facility and has been discussed with members of the\nEddyville Fire Dept..  Members of the Fire Department have visited this facility site and have\nseen the ammonia tankand system."
