      "SummaryText": "Paul Chemical and Fertilizer is an agricultural retail outlet, selling fertilizer and chemicals to farmers for crop production. We realize that the safe use of these products is a great benefit to our customers, enviroment, and the local residents. We also realize that the misuse and mishandling of some of these products can be dangerous. For this reason, we encourage and promote the safe use of these products in handling, storing, and usage.\n    Paul Chemical has invested a considerable amount of time and money in keeping our facility the safest it can be, from training our employees on how to use and transport chemicals and fertilizers, to building containment structures to stop andy leaks and accidental releases of products to the enviroment.\n   Any risk to the enviroment is with our storage of anhydrous ammonia. This is stored in one 10,000 gal tank and one 12,000 gal tank. These tanks are made to withstand very high pressures and high impacts. The worst case secenario release of ammonia would most likelty occur if on of the two inch pipe lines that service the storage tanks would break. This would allow ammonia from the storage tanks to enter the enviroment. This would not be an immediate loss of the full contents of the storage, but it would take 4 hours for all the ammonia to escape the tanks. This would allow the ammonia to dissepate innto the atmosphere at a rate that would keep the impact area relatively small. The prevailing winds usually blow from the west, which could blow the ammonia away from any nearby residences.\n   In the case of a release of ammonia into the enviroment, we would immediately contact the West End Fire Department. They would, depending on the situation, spray a water mist over the rupture to capture the ammonia with water to prevent it from escapeing into the enviroment. The residences and businesses in the impact area would be notified immediately as to a safe place to evacuate.\n  Ammonia is not a gas that readily seeps through stru"

But readily dissipates into the atmosphere with any wind disturbance.\n   Paul Chemical has an active safety program with training for the empoloyees both on the job and classroom study. We have SCBA's which our crew has been trained in the use and care. All of our crew that handles ammonia has passed a training program. We have not had a reportable accident in the last 5 years. \n   We try to work closely with our local fire department. They have taken tours of our facility, so they know what hazards we have and where they are. They have also shown us things that we need to improve to make our facility safer for them and for us. We take an active part in our community in regards to safety of hazardous materials. We have one employee that is a volunteer fireman and another that is on the local emergency planning committee. Also the president and owner of the company is a local resident, concerned about our community and how Paul Chemical might impact the local enviroment.\n   In the future, Paul Chemical plans on improving and updating its equipment to keep up with the new developments in the industry and to keep its facility safe for the employees and surrounding community. We will continue to train our employees in the proper handling of ammonia and the safeguards that need to be used. We will also continue to work with our local emergency responders to have a good working relationship for the benefit of both organizations"
