This rule was developed to assist facilities in evaluating the relative risk and impact of an accidental release of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMProgram applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that stores or uses a listed chemical above a pre-determined threshold quantity (' 68.115).\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements with different levels of detail. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with off-site consequences in the last five years and will have no off-site receptors in the event of a worst-case release, as defined by ' 68.22.  Program 3 applies to facilities in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe Chemical Plant (CP), a raw water pre-treatment facility, owned and operated by The Water Works and Sewer Board of the City of Birmingham (Board) uses gaseous chlorine, in amounts above the threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs., which is added to the raw water for the control of algae growth in the transmission main. \n\nDue to the proximity of public receptors and that OSHA's PSM standard was not applicable, eligibility as a Program 1 or 3 facility was eliminated. Therefore, the CP was reviewed and a RMProgram established under the requirements for a Program 2 facility (' 68.12).\n\n' 68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe CP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with off-site responders, that must be followed i"

These policies are presented in the Prevention Program (PP) and Emergency Response Program (ERP) sections of the RMProgram as required by 40 CFR Part 68 Subparts C and E.\n\n' 68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the CP chlorination facility.   The facility is equipped with chlorine detectors.  Audible alarms automatically sound when chlorine levels reach 1 part per million, within the facility, which allows safety personnel time to respond to emergencies.  In the unlikely event of a chlorine leak, an alarm in the control room of the CP informs the operator of the release and procedures in the ERP section of the RMProgram are initiated.\n\n' 68.155(c) Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\n As a Program 2 process, two scenarios were assessed for the chlorine facility, one worst-case and one under alternative release conditions.\n\n\n\nParameter\n\nWorst-case Scenario\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nEndpoint (mg/L)\n\n0.0087\n\n0.0087\n\nWind Speed (m/s)\n\n1.5\n\n3.0\n\nDirection of Wind\n\nNW\n\nNW\n\nAtmospheric Stability Class\n\nF\n\nD\n\nAmbient Temperature ((C)\n\n37.2\n\n25.0\n\nTemperature Adjustment Factor\n\n1.0123\n\n1.0\n\nHumidity (%)\n\n50\n\n50\n\nSurface Roughness\n\nRural\n\nRural\n\nDense or Buoyant Gas\n\nDense\n\nDense\n\nTemperature of Released Gas ((C)\n\n25.0\n\n25.0\n\nAmount of Release (kg)\n\n870\n\n143.8\n\nLength of Time for Release (min)\n\n10\n\n60\n\nHeight of Gas Release (m)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTable ES-1: Off-site Consequence Analysis Parameters\n\nTable ES-1 presents the required model inputs for the use of pre-calculated values found in Puglionesi et. al.

The worst-case scenario was defined as the release of the contents of one 2,000 lb. container of chlorine, stored outside, to the air over a ten-minute period.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA bad connection or valve failure was assumed for the alternative scenario, resulting in the release of gas through a 0.79 centimeter (5/16 inch) diameter valve.  The hypothetical release simulated a container stored horizontally with chlorine escaping as a gas.  The hypothetical release occurred over 60 minutes at a rate of 4.76 kilogram per minute (10.5 lbs./min) (Puglionesi et. al., 1998).  Both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios resulted in off-site impacts.\n\n' 68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe PP elements are presented in the PP section of the CP RMProgram, as required by Subpart C.  The following elements of the PP were developed with the intent of reducing the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from an accidental release of chemicals:\n\n* Safety Information         ' 68.48\n* Hazard Review            ' 68.50\n* Operating Procedures        ' 68.52\n* Training                ' 68.54\n* Maintenance            ' 68.56\n* Compliance Audit            ' 68.58\n* Incident Investigation        ' 68.60\n* Management System        ' 68.15\n\n' 68.155(e) Five-year Accident History\n\nThe CP has not had an accident, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), within the last five years.\n\n' 68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe ERP, as required by Subpart E, is provided in the CP RMProgram. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with local emergency planning agencies to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release, thereby protecting the public health and environment.\n\n' 68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations may be made upon the review of any accidents and/or when the RMProgram is update every five years. \n\n\nReferences\n\nPuglionesi, Peter S., Howard S.
