      "SummaryText": "Slack Chemical Co., Inc., an ISO 9001:2008 certified company, has utilized its Quality Manual to develop, implement and control policies and procedures of which pertain to the elements described within this plan. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been assembled in order to satisfy the requirements set forth within Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Slack Chemical's stationary source subject to this RMP is located at 465 South Clinton St., Carthage, NY 13619 and the regulated substances present in more than a threshold quantity are Chlorine as a liquefied gas stored in 150 pound cylinders and 2,000 pound containers and Ammonium Hydroxide (Aqueous Ammonia or Aqua Ammonia) stored in a bulk tank.\n\nThe worse-case release scenario is a total release of regulated substance from the largest storage vessel on-site, that being a 2,000 lb (ton) container of chlorine or the 15,000 gal capacity aqueous Ammonia tank. A puncture or breakage of a 150 lb chlorine cylinder has been considered as the alternative release scenario as well as for a 330 gal IBC tote of aqueous Ammonia. \n\nThe Ammonium Hydroxide and Chlorine are subject to this RMP covered by Prevention Program 2 and 3, respectively. The elements within both Programs have been satisfied and implemented as described further in each section.\n\nThe Carthage facility has been handling and storing both substances for several years and has, to date, no incidents involving the release of regulated substances from a covered process nor have any possible incidents occurred that may have resulted in a release.\n\nProcedures concerning an emergency response plan or action plan have been created and applied in accordance with OSHA standards.
