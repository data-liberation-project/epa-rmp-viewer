The odor threshold for TDI is 0.17 parts per million (ppm).  Acute exposure to high levels of TDI in humans, via inhalation, results in severe irritation of the skin and eyes and affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and central nervous systems (CNS).  The toxic endpoint for acute exposures established by EPA for Risk Management Programs is 7 mg/m3 (1 ppmv).\n\n\n\nTDI, which presently is delivered to "

The railcar and the tank truck share the unloading platform which is used to fill up to six storage tanks (1 - 5000, 3 - 4295 and 2 - 3431) for a capacity of 24,747 gallons located inside of the plant, within a specially designed containment room.  The threshold quantity for the Risk Management Plan for TDI is 10,000 lb. With a density of 10.2 lb per gallon the maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at the plant is 254,867 lbs, which includes 4 - 60 gallons day tanks.\n\n \n\nWhen the truck/railcar arrives it is inspected for any visible signs of damage or leaks.  Appropriate precautions and procedures are implemented if a truck/railcar is found to be deficient.  The railcar/truck is depressurized prior to connecting the offloading system.  Once the railcar/truck is depressurized the offloading system is connected and then the railcar/truck and storage tanks are slightly pressurized with a dry air blanket to prevent moisture buildup in the system.  The entire contents of the railcar/truck is transferred into six indoor storage tanks using blanket pressure; or our alternative pump system.  Due to the continuous operation of foam production, when TDI is required to be transferred to wet system day tank the pump in the storage tank room is activated.  The transfer operation ceases when the day tank sensor indicates that it is full or if filling has not been completed in a specified time (which could indicate a fill problem or leak).\n\n\n\nThe 60-gallon day tanks for each line are located on mezzanines.  Each day tank has a dry air blanket to prevent moisture.  TDI is transferred to the pour head through the \"wet system\", consisting of a conditioning pump, filter and heat exchanger followed by a metering pump (4000 psi) and which sends high pressure TDI through stainless steel piping to the pour heads.  The conditioning pump ensures a constant pressure and flow of TDI to the filter and heat exchanger to the metering pump.  A retu"

The filter and heat exchanger ensure the purity and appropriate temperature of TDI for foam production.\n\n\n\nA high pressure flow of TDI is received from the wet system to a flexible hose.  The pour head mixes the component raw materials (TDI and polyol / catalyst mixture) to a uniform mixture and transfers the mixture to the molds.  TDI pour head calibration is conducted on a preset schedule and interim adjustments are made as necessary.  To perform the calibration an operator sets the pour head to calibration mode, which injects one chemical at a time.  TDI is poured into a bucket and weighed to determine that the correct quantity of TDI is injected and the TDI is then either returned to the day tank or appropriately disposed. During molding operations once the TDI/polyol mixture is injected into the mold the mold is closed and an exothermic chemical reaction takes place that transforms the mixture to a polyurethane foam product.  Once this reaction takes place TDI is no longer present in quantities exceeding 1% marking the terminal node of the RMP regulated process.\n\n\n\nThe TDI process has numerous safeguards in place that help prevent the release of TDI and prevent on and off-site exposure if a release were to occur.  These include:\n\n?    A spill pad, trench and piping system in the rail/truck unloading area that will collect spilled TDI and passively transfer it to a lined holding pond;\n\n?    Isocyanate detectors which would set off alarms in the TDI storage room, mezzanine and pour head areas;\n\n?    Flow, temperature, timing and pressure systems with interlocks;\n\n?

Given that the TDI process contains substantial quantities of that if released outdoors could affect public receptors, it does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to this facility because it is not subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  \n\n\n\n \n\n3.0 OFF-SITE HAZARDS ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate RMPlans, the U.S. EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be utilized as administrative guides for planning purposes.  In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by \"worst-case\" analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized \"worst-case\" defined by the U.S. EPA methods and an alternative case, which is considered by Adient to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.\n\n \n\nTo ensure that mitigation measures and emergency response plans are appropriate, potential release scenarios are considered.  The Adient Greenfield facility works closely with the local LEPC and Fire Department.  Thus, the sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both the worst-case and the alternative case, believed to be somewhat more probable, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety provided "

      "SummaryText": "by the programs which constitute the Adient Risk Management Program.\n\n  \n\nThe RMP regulation defines a worst-case release of a liquid as an instantaneous spill of a single vessel accounting for passive mitigation including physical barriers that prevent the spread of the resulting pool and enclosures which would limit the rate of evaporation.  The temperature of the release is the maximum daily temperature over the past three years or the process temperature, whichever is higher.  The release to the atmosphere is assumed to be at ground level and dispersion conditions are set to atmospheric stability category F (very stable) and a surface (10 m) wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.\n\n   \n\nIn accordance with revised Risk Management Plan requirements promulgated on April 9, 2004 and in deference to the concerns of the Department of Homeland Security, this executive summary does not include a description of the release scenarios and their consequences.  Specific information regarding the off-site hazards assessment for worst-case and alternative releases is included in the RMP data elements.\n\n \n\n\n\n4.0   ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\n\n\nThe processes subject to the Risk Management Program 2 requirements to which the Adient facility is in full compliance.  Adient has in-place specific operational programs to address RMP Program Prevention Program requirements. These include: \n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Hazard Review\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training procedures for operators and general safety training for all employees\n\n?    Maintenance Procedures \n\n?    Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\nIn addition to these programs, Adient has designed and constructed the TDI system to meet stringent safety requirements.  \n\n\n\n\n\n5.0   FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there has been one incident at the Adient Greenfield, Ohio facility that qualifies for reporting.  The incident occurred on 3/13/19 at the railcar unload site where a bad valve on the railcar caused"

      "SummaryText": " a sudden release of 100 lbs. of Lupranate T80 Type 1 Isocyanate.  The incident caused one on-site injury.  Off-site Emergency response was called and regulatory authorities were contacted.  \n\nIn conjunction with the current ARP and Prevention Programs in place at the Adient facility, there is a standard management practice that requires immediate internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected.  The incident information is reviewed by supervisory staff and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are promptly notified.\n\n \n\n \n\n6.0   EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the Adient to place the highest priority on employee safety and health and on protection of the community from all plant-induced environmental conditions. Experience has shown that proper planning and an organized approach will reduce the effects of emergency events.  Prompt internal and external communications, emergency equipment, and trained personnel are the key ingredients of this plan.  Adient's policy provides for external communications with local and county-wide response agencies.  The Highland County HAZMAT Team has the lead responsibility in responding to major releases of TDI that would have the potential to affect off-site locations.\n\n\n\n \n\n7.0   PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAdient, under the recent RMP program, and earlier Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs, has organized its management system to effectively address hazards and potential risks.  Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, emergency preparedness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a"
