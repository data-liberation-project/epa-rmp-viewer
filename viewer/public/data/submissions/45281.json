The refrigerant used is anhydrous ammonia, a freon system is also on sight but does not require EPA compliance.  The refrigeration includes flash freezers and storage areas.  The system is designed and installed in accordance with industry standards.  All maintenance personnel and operators are trained in accordance with industry guidelines.  The facility has been in operation since 1998, and has not been modified until 2006 when an additional ammonia refrigeration system was installed.  The RMP was filed in conjunction with this addition.  There has been no incidents or releases of ammonia since 1998."
