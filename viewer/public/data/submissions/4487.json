      "SummaryText": "M.C Aluminum America and its management are committed to maintaining the safest working environment possible.  It is the companies' goal to maintain a safe and productive operation for the benefit of the employees and the community.  This is accomplished by safety committees, employee suggestions, monitoring devices, established safety procedures and guidelines and chemical specific training.  If management becomes aware of an issue that jeopardizes safety, plans will be implemented to correct this problem in a timely manner.\n\nFacility Description\n\nM.C. Aluminum America is a Secondary Aluminum Smelter S.I.C. 3341.  Our process involves the receiving of many types of aluminum scrap.  Much of the scrap we receive is aluminum turning chips that contain oils and cutting fluids.  The turning chips are dried in any of 2 rotary kiln dryers.  The dried turning chips along with other aluminum scrap such as wheels, radiators, window frames and various other aluminum scraps are melted in any of 3 reverberatory furnaces.  After a furnace is full, samples are taken to insure that all elements are within customer required specifications.  \n\nOn 1 of the 3 furnaces we will inject chlorine to reduce the magnesium content as requested by some of our customers.  We inject chlorine at a rate of 100 lb an hour.  On average we add a total of 200 lb of chlorine to each lot we produce.  It takes approximately 20 hours to produce I lot and we produce an average of 10 lots per month that require the use of chlorine.  This equals an average of 2000 lb of chlorine used per month and the total time that chlorine is in use averages out to 20 hours a month in 2 hour increments.  To accommodate this usage we maintain approximately 3000 lb of chlorine on site.  The chlorine is stored in 2, 1 ton containers in an enclosed cement block building behind the main production building.\n\nWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nA worst case release scenario was conducted using RMP Comp.  A wo"

      "SummaryText": "rst case release would mean a release of 2000 lb of chlorine in 10 minutes at a release rate of 200 lb/ min.  We keep our chlorine inside a building that would reduce the release rate to 110 lb/ min.  This scenario would have a toxic to end point of 0.9 miles.  Within this 0.9 mile there are approximately 50 homes, 20 businesss and a day care center.\n\nThere are only three ways that a worse case release could happen;\n\n1.  Something knocking a hole in the container. We have our chlorine in a building that nothing can enter to put a hole in the container.  The building is also located in a place away from all operations.\n\n2.  The ton container has a fusible plug that ruptures when the temperature of the plug reaches 158 ~ 165  F.  The reason for this is to prevent excessive pressure from building up inside the container.  To protect the containers from reaching these temperatures the building is located away from any heat sources and  because the containers are inside a building they are not exposed to the heat of the sun.  the building also has venting to prevent heat build up inside the building.\n\n3.  The third possibility of a worst case release comes from a container valve breaking off.  Each ton container has a valve that is attached by the supplier.  The valve is where the user makes the connection to the process.  Because of material construction, supplier maintenance and thorough operator training  and the fact that it would take a tremendous amount of force to break the valve it is highly unlikely that this situation would occur.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release\n\nGeneral accidents are a possibility, however by following the guidance of OSHA PSM and the procedures and policies implemented through the PSM such as our emergency shut off system, established operating procedures and managerial type controls we believe that  even a general type release is highly unlikely.  The following, lists our most important factors for this belief;\n\n7 Only trained and competent ope"

This shutoff system can be activated at any station throughout the process by pressing an emergency stop button.  The system will also automatically close the container if our monitoring system detects a leak.  This shutoff system has a battery backup.\n7 If the system is activated, the flow of chlorine is stopped within 1.5 seconds\n7 Once the system is activated, any chlorine remaining in the system empties into our furnace were it is of no danger of any negative effect \n7 Our chlorine system is not used during weather which may impact the safety of our operation, i.e.  thunderstorms or something that would terminate the electricity.\n\nFive year accident history\n \nWe are pleased to announce that we have not had a release since we began using chlorine 4 years ago.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe have an emergency response program that that has been established under the guidelines set by OSHA and enhanced using the guidelines set forth by RMP.  The program addresss the recognition of a chlorine release that warrants the activation of our emergency response plan.  The response plan explains the safe and swift removal of all non-essential personnel to a safe place of refuge were all can be accounted for.\n\nThe LEPC is our liaison for the hospital, police, sheriff's department and is also the agency who would actually evacuate the effected community in the event of an emergency.
