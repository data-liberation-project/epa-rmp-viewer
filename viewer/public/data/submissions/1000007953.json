      "SummaryText": "Aqueous ammonia (ammonia) is the most commonly used substance for reducing oxides of nitrogen from the electric power generating stations. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses ammonia for reducing the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from its Harbor Generating Station (HGS). Storing and handling large quantities of ammonia can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as it takes in power generation. The LADWP HGS ammonia handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program. The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs). The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of anemergency. LADWP prepared and submitted the original RMP for the HGS in June 1999.  This 2009 RMP submittal is the third five-year update of the original RMP. The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \r\n\r\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\r\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\r\n* Five-year accident history summary.\r\n* Emergency response program summary.\r\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nThe above information for the HGS is provided below.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.

Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department) to respond to any ammonia release that may occur at the HGS.\r\n\r\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nHGS is located in Wilmington, California. The HGS is a gas-fired electricity generating facility that supplies electrical power to the LADWP system. The facility is managed and operated around the clock. There is a minimum crew of three operators and one shift supervisor. On a normal day shift, there are approximately 75 on-site personnel including Operations, Technical, Maintenance, Clerical, and Warehouse staff.\r\n\r\nThe facility consists of two main 80-megawatt (MW) natural gas combustion turbines. These combustion turbines exhaust hot gases through two Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) to produce steam to drive a conventional 80 MW steam turbine. The HGS facility also installed five additional simple cycle gas or distillate oil fired turbines in 2001. These combustion turbines are capable of generating about 47 MW each of power.\r\n\r\nThe main combustion turbines and the five simple cycle turbines installed in 2001 are equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a combustion byproduct that is a precursor to ozone. In the presence of a catalyst housed in the SCR, ammonia (NH3) gas, a reducing agent, is injected into the flue gas to react with NOx to form nitrogen gas (N2) and water vapor (H2O) according to the following chemical reactions:\r\n      \r\n   4 NH3   +   6 NO --> 5  N2   +   6 H2O\r\n   8 NH3   +   6 NO2 --> 7  N2   +   12 H2O\r\n   \r\nAmmonia Process Description\r\n\r\nThe ammonia solution storage and supply system (ammonia process) has the dual function of injecting ammonia for NOx emissions control in each heat recovery steam generator and exhaust from f"

The ammonia process consists of three subsystems:\r\n\r\n* Ammonia Handling and Storage.\r\n* Emission Control.\r\n* Chemical Feed.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Handling and Storage\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia handling and storage subsystem supplies ammonia solution to the nitrogen oxide emission control catalyst and to the Chemical Feed subsystem. Aqueous ammonia solution is used instead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards requiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing.  The risks and safety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.\r\n\r\nAmmonia solution stored in aboveground tanks which are surrounded by a concrete containment system. Two pumps, each fully redundant, dispense ammonia solution to the emission control equipment. Other safety equipment associated with these tanks are: pressure/vacuum relief valves, liquid level alarms, two ammonia vapor scrubbers, quick fill connections, vapor recovery and associated piping, seven strategically-located ammonia vapor detectors, and three emergency eyewash/shower stations.\r\n\r\nAmmonia solution is delivered by truck into the storage tanks through a quick fill connection, located behind safety/collision barriers. The truck parks within a sloped containment area, which drains to a sump in the adjacent containment dike. The solution unloading to the storage tanks is done through a quick fill connection. A truck-mounted vapor recovery system is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading. The storage tanks are equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tanks are maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nA redundant dispensing pump is placed into service when either the main pumps fails or are out of service for preventative maintenance.

The loading operator is provided with a readily accessible water supply to wash spills quickly into the 8-foot trench for rapid containment. All spills are conveyed to a wastewater sump for treatment prior to discharge. Flashing lights and audible alarms at the tanks and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 20 parts per million in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nEmission Control\r\n\r\nAmmonia solution is pumped from storage tanks to two evaporator and air mixing chamber systems, one for each HRSG. These systems are located outside of the Power House building, along the southern wall at the southwestern corner. Heated air is provided to the air-mixing chamber by dilution air fans and heaters. The air/water vapor/ammonia mixture is then piped to the Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG) in the HRSG using an arrangement of nozzles to assure an even distribution throughout the flue gas.  The flue gas enters the SCR bed where the catalyst promotes the reaction.  Flow control valves operated as a function of combustion turbine load, the turbine exhaust flow rate, and the final stack exhaust nitrogen oxide concentrations control the feed rate of the ammonia solution.\r\n\r\nChemical Feed\r\n\r\nAmmonia solution from the storage tanks is automatically fed to a 200-gallon dilution tank where the solution is further diluted to 0.3%. The diluted solution is pumped to the boiler feed water system at a flow rate of up to 3 gallon per hour and 300-psig, based on the specific conductivity measurements of the feed water at the boiler feed pump discharge.
