This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Site personnel are trained to respond, control, and contain the release.\n\nIn addition, the facility has conducted informational safety meetings for members of the general public located within a one-mile radius of the plant and a half-mile radius of the Department of Transportation (DOT) pipeline and public responders from the surrounding area.  The safety program implemented by the facility also included a mass mailing of safety information brochures to the surrounding community.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Site is located approximately seven miles south of Clay City in Wayne County, Illinois.  The plant operates a variety of processes to refine field gas into various natural gas products.  The regulated substances handled at the facility include natural gas liquids such as propane, butane, pentane, and hexanes; condensate from natural gas; hydrogen sulfide; sulfur dioxide; ethyl mercaptan; carbon dioxide; diethanolamine; and lubricating oils.\n\nAPPLICABILITY\n\nBased on the definitions provided in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 68 (40 CFR 68), the Site operates one process that consists of the entire plant piping network, process vessels, and product storage.  \n\nBased on volume estimates and substance concentrations, the following substances exceed the reporting threshold as defined in 40 CFR 68.130:  propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane.

Therefore, the Site is considered part of Program 3 under 40 CFR 68.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nSince processes at the Site that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the Site OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Site encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Site and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Site has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various operational areas of the plant, including plant control operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\nThe facility conducts monthly safety meetings and quarterly safety breakfasts to discuss safety issues and hazard analysis at the Site.  The facility personnel utilize a Spill / Incident Review form to document spills or releases, to determine the cause, and prevent a reoccurrence. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe plant manager maintains a variety o"

These technical documents address chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories; equipment design; and basis process flow configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan is in place that addresses employee participation, and process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  The gas plant is equipped to ensure that the production and refining process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe plant manager also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction; design pressure and temperature ratings; and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Site has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Site primarily uses the fault tree analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  Fault tree analysis is recognized as a systematic hazard"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant manager periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. \n\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the  process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe plant manger maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

In addition, the plant manager maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Site uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Site personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

In addition, the Site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Site conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Site has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Site has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Site has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before"

Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Site promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Site periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent aud"
