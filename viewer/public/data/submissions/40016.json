Hutchinson Technology Incorporated's (HTI) accidental release prevention program involves policies and procedures that integrate technology, engineering, written procedures, and management practices to allow safe operation of the chlorine system.  HTI follows all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program.  These are summarized in Part (d) below.  HTI's emergency response program includes response plans that are coordinated with emergency response activities available in the community.  The emergency response program, summarized in Part (f) below, is in compliance with the USEPA's Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb. HTI uses a chemical process for etching stainless steel and stainless steel/polyimide/copper clad sheets (also called metal clad sheets).   These sheets are eventually processed into computer suspension assemblies used in the hard disk industry.  HTI's Hutchinson, Minnesota, facility uses only one chemical included in the RMP regulations:  chlorine. It is used in etchers for oxidation purposes to improve the performance of the etchant.\n\nChlorine is supplied to the etching process to maintain the etchant solution (iron chloride) in optimal etching condition.  The chlorine is received as a liquid in DOT specified metal tanks which are stored in two specially-engineered totally enclosed hold bunkers (half submerged below ground).  These bunkers can hold a total of eight 1-ton chlorine tanks (four in each bunker), but only one tank feeds the system at a time.  The liquid chlorine flows from the tanks to a system that converts the liquid to a gas (vaporizer).  The chlorine gas then flows to the mixing/holding etchant tanks (called sumps) where it enters the solution to chemically maintain the etchant.  Chlorine is fed into the etchant sumps in a controlled manner by sensors that signal the feed rate.  The storage bunkers, vaporizer, and delivery system contain multiple controls for redundancy, a"

An emergency response team is on call 24 hours a day to respond should there be a leak.\n\nc.  The off-site consequences analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios called \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release\".  The worst case scenario is defined by the USEPA as a scenario where \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified accident or failure.  This scenario does not depend on how or why it occurred and does not depend on whether it has ever been observed to have happened anywhere.  The requirements do not allow for any control of chlorine to be assumed except for a control that is \"passive\" (not human, electrical, or otherwise actively activated).  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario,\" but there are no other requirements as to defining the quantity released, except that active controls can be included thereby reducing the likelihood of  a release occurring or reducing the quantity that could potentially be released.  Consequently, HTI determined the alternative release scenario would be one that could reasonably occur  (even if it had not been observed) and would be one where a chlorine release could be controlled.\n\nHTI's worst case scenario for chlorine is the release of one chlorine tank contents.  HTI's alternative release scenario is a valve failure in the storage pit releasing one pound of chlorine of which 0.75 pound is captured and controlled by the scrubber and 0.25 pound is released to the environment.  \n\nHTI's Hutchinson, MN facility population estimate within the worst-case scenario distance to end-points was calculated by using software from the US Census Bureau.  The software is the Census 2000 Summary File 3, Census of Population and Housing, DVD issued January 20"

The HTI accidental release prevention program is part of a long-established operating management system.  The prevention program contains the following key components:\n\n-- High level training for personnel involved in the chlorine system and operators of the etchant\n-- Predictive preventive maintenance programs for all components of the chlorine system\n-- Use of state-of-the-art safety equipment, including chlorine monitors and control systems\n-- Use of chlorine monitoring equipment and alarms\n-- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of employees\n--  Regular process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n--  Use of an auditing and inspection program\n\nThe prevention program also includes chlorine-specific exposure prevention steps including: (1) awareness training of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, (2) presence of chlorine detectors, and (3) special ventilation systems that can be manually activated when chlorine is detected.  This special ventilation enhances employee safety by reducing chlorine exposure.\n\ne. No accidental release of chlorine has occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.
