      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for Chemtrade Logistics, Inc., Cairo Sulfur Products\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Cairo Sulfur Products are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Allen County Emergency Services and Cairo Fire Department, which provides highly, trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass production of sulfuric acid and liquid sulfur dioxide. We have four (4) RMP regulated substances present at our facility in significant quantities.  These substances include sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia and oleum, a mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid and is sold as a product. Oleum is used for producing sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is used in water treatment. Ammonia is used in refrigeration.\n\nThe maximum inventory of oleum that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is 18000 lb. The maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is 500,000 lb. The maximum inventory of chlorine that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is 1350 lb, which is below the Threshold Planning Quantity for RMP. The maximum in"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The sulfur dioxide processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nCairo Sulfur Products maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (time period).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cairo Sulfur Products maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCairo Sulfur Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedu"

Refresher training is provided at least every three   years and more frequently as needed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\nCairo Sulfur Products carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Cairo Sulfur Products to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cairo Sulfur Products.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCairo Sulfur Products conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCairo Sulfur Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nCairo Sulfur Products truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  \n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Cairo Sulfur Products has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nCairo Sulfur Products has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, No accidental releases have occurred during this period. \n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nCairo Sulfur Products carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  \n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pert"
