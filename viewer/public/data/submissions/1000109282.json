EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe ISP Chemicals LLC (ISP) facility located in Calvert City, Kentucky, (Site), a division of Ashland Specialty Ingredients, is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation and is RC14001 certified.  In addition, as part of this commitment, ISP has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the ISP Calvert City plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rule 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the RMP at the ISP Calvert City plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the RMP.\n\n1.1\t\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n     ISP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  ISP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  ISP evaluates each situation; evacuates workers, as necessary; responds based on our capabilities, skills and training; and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid Association,"

Calvert Industry, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Calvert City Fire Department have also established a system for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\nISP\u0092s Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP for EPA-regulated processes at their respective facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment, and RMPlan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Manager; Safety Health and Security Manager; and Safety Engineer.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n1.2\t\tISP's Calvert City Plant Regulated Substances\n\n The ISP Calvert City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in the Purchase Area of far Western Kentucky, in Calvert City, in northern Marshall County.  The ISP Plant is one of the largest industrial employers (approximately 385 site employees) in Marshall County.  We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: acetylene, ammonia, benzene, acetone, ethanol, butanediol, vinyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, iodine, styrene, methanol, propane, cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, isobutylene, and isopropyl acetate. The ISP Calvert City Plant makes a variety of products:  Butyrolactone, 2-pyrrolidone, Vinyl Pyrrolidone, Poly Vinyl Pyrrolidones,"

Because processes at ISP that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for chemical manufacturing facilities, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended, where necessary, to satisfy EPAs Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n1.4.1\tEmployee Participation\n     \n ISP encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and plant and process inspection teams.  Employees have access to information created as part of the Site accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Safe Work Practices Procedures (SWPP) 29.  SWPP 29, known as the Employee Participation Plan, is maintained at ISP and addresses each accident prevent"

In addition, ISP has a number of initiatives underway that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\nThese initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of ISP, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n1.4.2\tProcess Safety Information\n     \n  ISP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within ISP are assigned responsibility for maintaining up to date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets.  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, ISP has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating manuals.  ISP ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nISP also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility change"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nISP primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team\u0092s recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution.  Implementation of safety improvements, in response to PHA findings, is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a layer of protection analysis (LOPA) method to guide in the prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to the PHA team\u0092s recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, ISP periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating."

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them, as necessary, to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use, as necessary, to safely perform their job tasks.\n     \n1.4.5\tTraining\n\n     To complement the written procedures for process operations, ISP has implemented a training program for employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training on plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, new operators are paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
