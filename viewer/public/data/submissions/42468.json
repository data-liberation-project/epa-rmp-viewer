              "Description": "Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA guidelines. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety information\n\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n Process Hazard Analysis\n\nWe conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is  HAZOP and /or  What If analysis whichever appropriate.  A team has performed all the process hazard analysis (PHA) with expertise in engineering, and process operations. All the PHAs are updated and revalidated by a competent team described above and all action items/ recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown .  \n\nWe have a system in place so that all the required operating procedures stay current and accurate. It is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\nWe have a  system in place so that all required training are conducted in a timely manner as required by law.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten  procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by  a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nWe conduct audit on a regular basis to determine whether provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out atleast every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken  in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWe believe that  accident prevention through implementation of PSM/RMP is a team effort. Company employees routinely participate in process hazard analysis study, operating procedures update, department inspection, accident investigations,  updating safe work permit procedure, emergency drills etc. \n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, we hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selection of a contractor, a through evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. We have a  strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.    \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nVinyl Acetate & Acrylonitrile storage tanks\n\nWe have constructed  vinyl acetate and acrylonitrile storage tanks applying safe engineering practices. We conduct  mechanical integrity testing of the tanks on a regular basis. The tanks have secondary containment and hydrant mounted monitors to minimize the impact  in case of a release.\n\nEthylene Storage Tank\n\nThe ethylene storage system was built in 1997 as per applicable engineering standard. The access to the tank is restricted. It has been pressure tested prior to placing in service and  we conduct  mechanical integrity testing of the tank on a regular basis. All electrical accessories  such as pump, instruments and wiring is explosion proof and constructed as per applicable electrical codes. It has a state of the art redundant pressure relief system and is monitored 24 hours a day by a remotely located video camera.  The loading of  the product is generally conducted during daytime only  and any excess emission of ethylene is passed through a flare system.",

              "Description": "Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA guidelines. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety information\n\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n Process Hazard Analysis\n\nWe conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is  HAZOP and /or  What If analysis whichever appropriate.  A team has performed all the process hazard analysis (PHA) with expertise in engineering, and process operations. All the PHAs are updated and revalidated by a competent team described above and all action items/ recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown .  \n\nWe have a system in place so that all the required operating procedures stay current and accurate. It is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\nWe have a  system in place so that all required training are conducted in a timely manner as required by law.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten  procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by  a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nWe conduct audit on a regular basis to determine whether provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out atleast every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken  in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWe believe that  accident prevention through implementation of PSM/RMP is a team effort. Company employees routinely participate in process hazard analysis study, operating procedures update, department inspection, accident investigations,  updating safe work permit procedure, emergency drills etc. \n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, we hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selection of a contractor, a through evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. We have a  strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.    \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nVinyl Acetate & Acrylonitrile Storage tanks\n\nWe have constructed  vinyl acetate and acrylonitrile storage tanks applying safe engineering practices. We conduct  mechanical integrity testing of the tanks on a regular basis. The tanks have secondary containment and hydrant mounted monitors to minimize the impact  in case of a release.\n\nEthylene Storage Tank\n\nThe ethylene storage system was built in 1997 as per applicable engineering standard. The access to the tank is restricted. It has been pressure tested prior to placing in service and  we conduct  mechanical integrity testing of the tank on a regular basis. All electrical accessories  such as pump, instruments and wiring is explosion proof and constructed as per applicable electrical codes.

      "SummaryText": ".  A team has performed all the process hazard analysis (PHA) with expertise in engineering, and process operations. All the PHAs are updated and revalidated by a competent team described above and all action items/ recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, we maintain written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown  etc.  \n\nWe have a system in place so that all the required operating procedures stay current and accurate. It is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. \n\nWe have a  system in place so that all required training are conducted in a timely manner as required by law.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten  procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by  a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nWe conduct audit on a regular basis to determine whether provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out atleast every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken  in a safe and prompt manner"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWe believe that  accident prevention through implementation of PSM/RMP is a team effort. Company employees routinely participate in process hazard analysis study, operating procedures update, department inspection, accident investigations,  updating safe work permit procedure, emergency drills etc. \n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, we hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selection of a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. We have a  strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.    \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nVinyl Acetate & Acrylonitrile Storage Tanks\n\nWe have constructed  vinyl acetate and acrylonitrile storage tanks applying safe engineering practices. We conduct  mechanical integrity testing of the tanks on a regular basis. The tanks have secondary containment and hydrant mounted monitors to minimize the impact  in case of a release.\n\nEthylene\n\nThe ethylene storage system was built in 1997 as per applicable engineering standard. The access to the tank is restricted. It has been pressure tested prior to placing in service and  we conduct  mechanical integrity testing of the tank on a regular basis. All electrical accessories  such as pump, instruments and wiring is explosion proof and constructed as per applicable electrica"

The loading of  the product is generally conducted during daytime only and any excess emission of ethylene is passed through a flare system.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere was one incident over the last 5 years which resulted in significant property damage at the site. \n\n5.   Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe have a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning for potential chemical accidents, we communicate and work closely with local emergency planning committee and other community responders, such as fire department, ambulance crews, etc. These responders and our employees perform emergency drills together periodically. The emergency plan is updated promptly to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn March 2003, we conducted a thorough inspection of our vinyl acetate storage tank and seals. The primary and secondary seals were found to be intact and in good condition. However the primary and secondary seals were replaced as a proactive preventative measure."
