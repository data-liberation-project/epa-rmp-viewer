Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders i"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  The substance is Formaldehyde present as a 37% aqueous solution.  Formaldehyde is warehoused at the facility for distribution to industrial users.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde solution at our facility exceeds the RMP threshold for formaldehyde.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(Including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Formaldehyde.  The scenario involves the release of 55 gallons of Formaldehyde solution.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of 1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.06 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
