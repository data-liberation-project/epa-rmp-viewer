As part of this commitment, BSE has established a system to help ensure safe \r\noperation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program \r\n(RMP) for anhydrous ammonia that helps manage the risks at BSE and that complies with the requirements of \r\nthe United States Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (USEPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release \r\nPrevention Requirements:  Risk Management Program.  \r\n\r\nOne of the requirements of RMP is to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the RMP \r\nelements at BSE.  This document, in conjunction with BSE\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual, is \r\nintended to satisfy the management requirements of RMP.  The following is a summary of BSE\u00bfs RMP:\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\r\nBSE is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors, visitors, and the surrounding public, and to \r\nthe preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous \r\nsubstances.  BSE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  \r\nBSE personnel are trained to respond defensively to releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Their response \r\nincludes the prompt notification of emergency response personnel.  The facility has coordinated \r\nemergency response procedures with the local fire department and Green County Emergency \r\nManagement.  In the event of a release, which could result in an off-site impact, Green County Emergency \r\nManagement will be contacted to alert the general public.\r\n\r\n2.\tBadger State Ethanol and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\nThe BSE facility in Monroe, Wisconsin, produces fuel-grade ethanol from corn.  The BSE facility has a \r\nProgram 3 covered process due to the on-site storage and use of an"

Anhydrous \r\nammonia is used at the facility to control the pH of the slurry tank and to provide nutrients for the yeast \r\nthat is used for fermentation of the grain.  An administrative limit has been implemented to limit the \r\nmaximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in this system to 74,880 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThis facility is covered by both the USEPA\u00bfs RMP Rule and Occupational Safety and Health \r\nAdministration\u00bfs (OSHA) PSM Rule for the anhydrous ammonia process.  This facility implements one \r\ncombined Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  This program consists of a written \r\nmanagement system.  The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This \r\nprocedure enables the facility to initiate and complete process changes associated with the anhydrous \r\nammonia system while maintaining the Process Safety and Risk Management Program requirements at the \r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nBoth the worst-case and alternative release scenarios were based on equipment failure; therefore, the \r\nmechanical integrity element of the program is key in preventing releases from the anhydrous ammonia \r\nprocess.  This facility utilizes a computerized maintenance management system to implement the \r\npreventive maintenance, testing, and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia system.  The maintenance \r\nmanagement system supports the routine preventive maintenance program, which in combination with \r\nBSE\u00bfs employee and contractor training programs provides ongoing assurance that the anhydrous \r\nammonia system is operated in a safe manner.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe 5-Year Accident History\r\nThis facility began operation on October 22, 2002.  BSE has not experienced an RMP reportable release or \r\naccident involving anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Emergency Response Program\r\nThe BSE emergency response program is based on OSHA\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan requirements under \r\n29 CFR 1910.38.

The facility will continue to make improvements as \r\nidentified by BSE employees, visitors, and contractors."
