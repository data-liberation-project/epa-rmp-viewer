Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, employee training and management practices.  \n\n\n\nThe Company's emergency response plan involves the preparation of action plans and training of employees. The Company's refrigeration personnel are trained in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119\n\n\n\nAt The Company, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n?    Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n?    Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n?    Reduce the threat to the community\n\n\n\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nMcDougall & Sons Inc. North Baker Flats Facility is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 5905 Nelpar Drive East Wenatchee, Douglas County, WA.  The facility receives fruit from the surrounding area and packages them for shipment to wholesale and retail customers. The facility is also used as a refrigerated warehouse to hold fruit in storage till it can be packaged for shipment. \n\n\n\nThe hazardous substances which exceed the threshold quantity IAW EPCRA at North Baker Flats are: \n\n1.    Anhydrous Ammonia, AKA NH3, or R717. Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility as refrigerant. CAS number is 7664-41-7\n\n2.    Sulfuric Acid which is used as an electrolyte for batteries that power forklifts used in the movement of product throughout the facility. CAS number is 7664-93-9\n\n\n\nC.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Company's accidental release prevention program is based on the following ke"

Technology in the form of a remote controls system, through phone land lines and cellular networks, which allows constant 24 hour monitoring by engineers. System parameters and controls can be accessed by this system. This provides for immediate response to system malfunctions or emergencies.\n\n?

Written safety procedures and safety equipment which is part of the Process Safety Management program required by the state of Washington and the Federal government\n\n?    Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures which is part of the Process Safety Management program required by the state of Washington and the Federal government\n\n?    Strict adherence to codes and rules in construction and repairs of system components. \n\n\n\nC.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe North Baker plant was brought online in February of 2014. \n\nThere have not been any reportable incident since that date. \n\n\n\nD.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, The Company has established Emergency Action plans for this facility. This plan provides guidance for employees on actions to take in the event of an ammonia release.  These actions include initial action procedures, evacuation procedures, reporting procedures and control procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Company  will work with the local LEPC to ensure it is aware of the emergency actions which will be taken in the event of a release at the North Baker facility. \n\n\n\nE.    Planned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM / RMP program, McDougall & Sons looks continuously for possible ammonia system changes to improve safety of our process and our employees. \n\n\n\nWe will continue to seek educational opportunities to build on our knowledge to improve employees ex"
