      "SummaryText": "This document is the Executive Summary of the Star of the West Milling Co. - Risk Management Program - for the Ligonier Flour Mill.  The flour mill has chlorine gas on site in the form of one ton containers.  Star of the West works together with our chlorine supplier and local and regional fire departments to establish effective procedures for an immediate response in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas.  We have written procedures for the handling of chlorine and conduct annual employee training on the hazards associated with chlorine and the safe handling of chlorine.  Our chlorine monitoring system monitors any potential leakage in the chlorine storage areas and the agitators. Sensors are equipped with gas generating devices which tests the systems efficacy daily.  Sensors are connected to a Halogen Valve Controller system with Eclipse actuators which is an automatic closure system to provide further safety redundancy to the manual operation of chlorine supply valves.  We have also installed amperage meters on the Blowers to and from the agitator to prevent an unintended discharge.\n\n    We are committed to the safety of our employees and our community.  The flour mill provides top quality flour to a number of food companies in the midwest.  We use chlorine gas to bleach certain brands of flour and adjust their Ph.  We typically have eight one-ton containers on site.  Four are connected at any given time; four are reserve tanks.  The containers are stored in a separate, isolated block building, which is adjacent ot the flour mill.  Our piping is designed for use with chlorine gas and is inspected regularly.  We have not had any reportable accidents in the past five years.  We continually strive to improve the safety of our imployees and community with safe handling and usage of chlorine at our mill."
