      "SummaryText": "1.  The owners, management and employees of Champaign Landmark, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with local fire departments, or any other authorities to mitigate any relase and minimize the impact of the release on the public and the environment.\n\n2.  The Horton facility is located in the country due north of West Mansfield along the CSX railroad.  The Horton facility is a grain and fertilizer facility that uses anhydrous ammonia for the direct application of crop production nutrients.  Horton receives anhydrous by both rail and semi.  Horton has a 18,000 gal tank that would have a maximum of 79,560 lbs storage.  The maximum amount handled would be while unloading a semi truck holding 42,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 79,560 lbs which represents 85% of the storage tank.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion of 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario based on a five year accident history or the most likely potential is a release from a break in a 2\" transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .48 miles, with a release of 11,908 lbs.\n\n5.  There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\n6.  Champaign Landmark's Emergency Response Plan has been reviewed recently and gone over with all personnel.\n\n7.Our company policy is to remain proactive in the areas of safety and accident prevention.  With the ODA - Workers Comp and our own audits we feel that the chances for accidental releases are minimal.  We are making no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes at this time."
