They are; The Aqueous Ammonia Production unit where Anhydrous Ammonia and Ammonia Solution > 19% are used, the Dispersant Production Unit where Oleum and Formaldehyde are used and the Chemical Distribution production unit where Hydrofluoric Acid, Formaldehyde and Ammonia Solution are used.\n\n The Aqueous Ammonia Production Unit produces 29% Ammonium Hydroxide by mixing Anhydrous Ammonia with de-ionized water. \n\nThe Dispersant Production Unit produces a dispersant which is used as a super plastisizer in concrete. Textiles also use the dispersant to disperse various pigments ancillary to the preperation of dyes.  \n\nThe Chemical Distribution Production Unit facilitates the distribution chemicals to industry and municipalities. It does not manufacture chemicals. The Chemical Distribution Production Unit procures chemicals from other manufacturers, stores the chemicals, in some cases re-packages the chemicals and then distributes them to the market place. \n\n Has process safety information been compiled for each chemical?\n\nBorden & Remington has assembled process safety information as required by 40 CFR 68.65 for each of the RMP regulated chemicals on site. The safety information includes offsite consequence analysis where theoretical worst case and alternative case chemical release migrations were plotted. The information was utilized by the different Process Safety Teams to conduct process hazard analyses for the production unit specific to the listed chemicals. The process safety information is reviewed on an annual basis and annotated if the information changes.\n\n Have Process Hazard Analyses been completed and subsequent recommendations developed? \n\n Borden & R"

Piping and instrument diagrams and other safety information were used to consider deviations from design intention. Consequence, cause and existing safeguards and their corresponding level of risk were considered when developing recommendations to reduce risk. A number of recommendations have been chosen as action items and a schedule has been developed to implement the same.\n\nHave operating procedures been developed/updated for processes utilizing the listed chemicals?\n\nBorden & Remington has developed standard operating procedures(SOPs) for every process performed by its employees. The company is ISO 9001 and ISO 9000 certified and as such has a management system in place to maintain the standard operating procedures. The SOPs for PSM and RMP listed chemicals have been updated to include safety information and warnings at crucial steps within the process. The \"crucial steps\" are those that the process hazard analyses have identified as intrinsically risky. If possible crucial steps have been modified or eliminated. The updated SOPs work to reduce risk through modified standardized methodologies.\n\nDo employees receive adequate training in the SOPs for RMP regulated chemicals?\n\nAs of June 21, 1999 all Borden & Remington employees that work within the RMP regulated production units have been certified to posses the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities. Borden & Remington has in place a training program that ensures that each employee is given refresher training every 3 years.\n\nDoes Borden & Remington have a Preventative Maintenance Program in place that will ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment used in the RMP regulated production units?\n\nThe Preventative Maintenance Program in place at Borden & Remington requires weekly ins"
