If the entire contents of this tank were released over 10 minutes, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 1.6 miles. \nAlternative Case Scenario\nA release scenario considered by SFIA to be more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario would be a break in a chlorine transfer pipe (pigtail). Under this scenario, 136.8 pounds of gaseous chlorine would be released over 10 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario was calculated at 0.4 miles. Release through the pigtail at this rate would result in freezing and the leak may be sealed.\n \nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\nOur facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.

Upon request of the local emergency planning committee or emergency response officials, promptly provide to the local emergency response officials information necessary for developing and implementing the community emergency response plan.\n7 Training with local emergency response agencies and local emergency care providers.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release program. The PHAs was conducted in May 13, 1999 under the RMP and CalARP program requirements. Based on these reviews, eleven additional changes were identified to improve the safety of the chlorination system. It is expected that the recommended actions be evaluated and imple"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nFlammable substances are widely used in industry, in the home, in the environment. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. We at San Francisco International Airport (SFIA) Water Quality Control Plant use chemicals, too. We use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe water discharges to the environment or for landscaping or irrigation uses. Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard. We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do take providing the environment safe disinfected water. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency. Please feel free to contact Ron Wilson at (650) 876-2422 if you have any questions.\nSFIA Water Quality Control Plant's basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements. We have developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\nWe plan to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents. Chlorine is regulated under the RMP requirements. \nWe have developed programs to co"

We currently store chlorine in quantities up to nine one-ton cylinders. Typically, gas phase chlorine under pressure is withdrawn from one on-line storage cylinder but can be withdrawn from up to three cylinders. As many eight back-up cylinders are stored in the same room. The pressurized chlorine gas from the 1-ton containers is reduced to vacuum, passed through one of five chlorinators and injected into plant process water.\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nWe developed worst-case and alternative case release scenarios for chlorine to determine the effects an accidental chemical release would have on the public. The development of the worst-case scenario is directed by the EPA regulation. Namely, the quantity of a substance released is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipeline. The alternative case release scenario developed is considered more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. However, the alternative case release scenario is still considered unlikely to occur. As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, SFIA is constantly monitoring, reviewing, and upgrading its standard operating procedures and equipment. In addition to these administrative controls, SFIA has automatic release mitigation systems in place for the regulated substances, which are discussed below. \nFor worst-case and alternative case release scenarios, the USEPA-approved Dense Gas Release Model (D"
