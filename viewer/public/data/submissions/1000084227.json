In addition, some of the detail provided within this summary was excluded from the submitted RMP as current public access to this detail could expose the facility and personnel to terrorist or criminal activity.\r\n\r\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1. The process is subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance. \r\n\r\nThis program was updated to satisfy the required 5 year update per section 2745.10(a) (1) and to make corrections as necessary. All elements have been reviewed and updated.\r\n\r\nThe following areas are addressed in this summary:\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures \r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n5.\tThe five-year accident history\r\n6.\tThe emergency response program\r\n7.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nB-1   ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nMercer Foods is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.

The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\r\n\r\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.  State regulations require reporting when there is a significant release or a threat of a significant release of ammonia or other hazardous material.  Mercer Foods interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury. \r\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\r\n\r\nB-2   STATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system/process is a direct, closed loop, mechanical refrigeration system.

The Prevention Program implemented by Mercer Foods is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of Mercer Foods Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information.  The facility has retained the original manufacturer OEM manuals, equipment drawings, etc. for reference purposes and aid in maintenance activities.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Review study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  In addition, some of these elements are reviewed and trained on annually or every three years or if a change is made at minimum as required by the code and industry standards. This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\nSecond, all Mercer Foods employees and at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.
