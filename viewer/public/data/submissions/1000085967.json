This commitment is evidenced by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the Memphis site utilizes the highly trained local Memphis Fire and contractors to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Organic chemical synthesis.  We have 3 RMP substance regulated at our facility.  The substance Furan is involved in several uses throughout plant including as a raw material and a commercial chemical product.  There is also Cyclohexylamine and Dimethylamine 40% which are used as raw materials in our specialties product manufacturing area to make other commercial chemical products.  Unlike Furan that is piped and used throughout the plant, these chemicals are stored in isolated locations in totes and a tank. \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. In order to perform the required off-site consequence analysis the Pennakem Memphis facility used EPA's RMP COMP software.  While Pennakem Memphis has a program to respond to a release of furan, this worst case scenario does not allow any active mitigation to be considered, and further requires the release to occur under conditions that are not indicative of any conditions which have been encountered.

The furan liquid is assumed to be immediately released from which evaporation takes place. Cyclohexylamine was the only other Program 3 toxic substance submitted as a alternative scenarios. This is stored in totes and the likely release would include puncturing a drum. One alternative release scenario is included for furan as part of the Program 3 processes. The alternative release scenario allows use of active and passive mitigation.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances also involves releasing dimethylamine (DMA) over a short period of time.  However, DMA is stored and used at our site in aqueous solution form and the likely release would include puncturing the tank.  An alternative release scenario for this flammable substance was also evaluated.\r\n\r\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State Building codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 including the one containing furan.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nPennakem, LLC Memphis Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that haza"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval of at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pennakem Memphis Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround, as well as consiquences of deviation from approved standard operating procedures.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nPennakem Memphis Plant continues to build and improve a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nPennakem Memphis Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
