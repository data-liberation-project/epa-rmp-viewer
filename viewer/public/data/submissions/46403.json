As such, we have created a Process Safety Plan and Manual (PSM) which details the elements of our efforts to create a safe and responsible systematic process for the storage and freezing of cranberries and cranberry products. Our plan and safety programs also reduce the risks associated with the operation and maintenance of our refrigeration system. We use a combination of training, engineering controls, management of changes and regular review of our performance to ensure we are operating safely and efficiently. Regular maintenance and inspection of our refrigeration process reduces the likelihood of any incident which might cause a release of the refrigerant.\nOur storage facility is located at 801 21st Avenue North in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, in the industrial park. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in our facility. We do not process ammonia; it is completely contained in the refrigeration piping and equipment. All our employees are trained in preventing any release of the refrigerant and proper procedures for handling the refrigerant.The management of W R Cold Storage is committed to maintaining the highest integrity of the systems and people within the company. W R Cold complies with the Process Safety Management requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Risk Management Plan requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In the unlikely event that a release of refrigerant should occur, we have coordinated response planning with the hazardous materials response unit of the Wisconsin Rapids Fire Department and are committed to open and rapid communication with the community. Regular interaction with members of the Wisconsin Rapids Fire Department will ensure that the response team will be adequately prepared in the event a release of refrigerant does occur. If any member of the public would like to see our facility or review our policies, we "
