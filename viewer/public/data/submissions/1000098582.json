These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\n    Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\n    Ammonia is used at our facility as the cooling and freezing medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental re"

These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We have a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond to system upsets.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n    Employee Participation Program\n\n    Process Safety Information\n\n    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n    Operating Procedures\n\n    Training Program\n\n    Contractor Safety Program\n\n    Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\n\n    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n    Hot Work Permit Procedures\n\n    Management of Change Procedures\n\n    Incident Investigation Procedures\n\n    Compliance Audit Procedures\n\n\n\nD. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences. \n\n\n\n"
