      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Henry J. Mills Filtration Plant (Mills Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nMills Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies."

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for chlorine involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Mills Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan is being  coordinated with local response agencies (City of Riverside Fire Department).  Mills Plant has an excellent safety record with chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Henry J. Mills Filtration Plant is located at 550 E. Alessandro Boulevard in Riverside, California.  The plant is situated west of Interstate Highway 215 and south of State Highway 60, covering approximately 256 acres.  The facility was constructed in 1978. The plant is designed to treat drinking water including disinfection wit"

Chlorine is received at the Mills Plant and stored by the unloading platform located immediately north of the Chlorine Building.  The chlorine evaporators are in the Evaporator Room and the chlorinators are in the Chorination Room; both rooms are in the Chlorine Building.  The chlorine storage and use at the Mills Plant is subject to EPA and CalARP rules, as well as the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.\n\nThe chlorine unloading area located immediately north of the Chlorine Building is continuously monitored in the control room by chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak sensors are also provided in the Chlorine Building (evaporator and chlorinator rooms) and chlorine vent boxes, located outside the building.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process, is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system from any of the two control panels: unloading platform and control room. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided on the chlorine unloading platform and outside the Chlorine Building.\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.  In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the control room.  The filtration plant has an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the filtration plant in the event of a power failure.  \n\nThe control room at the plant"

This system allows Mills Plant staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The Mills Plant will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMills Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Mills Plant chlorine system.\n\nFive-year Ac"

      "SummaryText": "cident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Mills Plant during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nMills Plant is a first responder facility (i.e. HAZWOPER trained plant employees respond to chlorine accidental releases). Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the City of Riverside Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine release.  As part of the emergency response program, the Mills Plant has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan (HMHWCP) for the purpose of protecting plant employees, public health and the environment.  The HMHWCP has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\n\nThe HMHWCP plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (City of Riverside Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the Mills Plant.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and are being implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in March 2004, when the 1998 RMP"

      "SummaryText": "process hazard analysis was reviewed and updated.  It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented in a timely fashion.\n\nAs part of this ongoing commitment to keep enhancing chlorine process safety, MWDSC will be constructing a facility at Mills Plant for containment of the storage area and scrubbing of both the chlorine process building and storage containment (to collect and neutralize an accidental chlorine release). This chlorine containment and neutralization project will markedly reduce the accidental release risk to plant employees, the surrounding community and the environment. The project is currently in the preliminary design phase, with construction scheduled to begin early 2006 and the facility is expected to be in operation Spring 2007."
