      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nSouth East Kern River Cogen\nExecutive Summary\n\nA.  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nTexaco has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\nB. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe South East Kern River Cogen (SEKR Cogen) is located at 3500 Alfred Harrell Highway, north east of the town of Bakersfield, California within the South East Kern River oilfield.  The facility was designed and constructed by Shell Oil in 1988, and operated by Shell and its affiliates until purchased by Texaco in April of 1999. \n\nThe SEKR Cogen consists of three gas turbines, which drive electric generators rated to produce 27 megawatts of electric power.  Heat recovery steam generators are connected to the turbines.  In the steam generators, waste heat from the turbine exhaust is exchanged with water producing about 10,000 barrels of steam per day. The electric power generated by the facility is used to supply internal load requirements for Texaco and neighboring properties.  Excess power is sold to the utility grid.  The steam generated by the facility is used for enhanced oil recovery projects. \n\nAs part of the air permit issued by the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, the LM2500 turbine has a two step process to limit NOx emissions.  In the first step, demineralized water is injected into the combustion chamber of the turbine, reducing combustion temperatures and NOx formation.  In the second step"

      "SummaryText": ", a small concentration of ammonia is mixed into the turbine exhaust gas which then flows across a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst where NOx and ammonia chemically react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  The amount of ammonia used is maintained by a computer control system based upon a preset ammonia feed rate.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon pressurized storage tank with an inventory limit of 10,200 gallons.  The storage tank is operated at about 50 psig but is designed to withstand a pressure of 300 psig.  The 300 psig design condition is well in excess of that which can be caused by atmospheric heating.  The storage tank is protected by two 300 psig relief valves, one of which is always in service.  Ammonia vapor is withdrawn from the top of the storage tank and fed to an intermediate accumulator where the pressure is held at about 30 psig.  The pressure in the storage tank is prevented from falling below the minimum pressure set point by two liquid ammonia evaporators.  The ammonia is fed from the accumulator, diluted with air to a concentration of less than two percent by volume, and is then injected into the turbine exhaust.  \n\nThe storage tank is refilled three or four times a year.  At that time, a tank truck of ammonia is connected to the storage tank's liquid loading and vapor return lines. The lines are protected by pull-away valves and excess flow check valves.  In addition, the liquid loading line has a check valve to prevent reverse flow from the storage tank to the tank truck.  \n\n\nC.  Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of ammonia at the SEKR Cogen, based on EPA directive, is a catastrophic release of the total volume of the 10,200 gallon storage tank over a ten minutes period. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were allowed to be taken"

Therefore the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia in the worst case scenario would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) associated with the ammonia operations at the SEKR Cogen is a based on the most likely event with an endpoint beyond the boundaries of the facility.  This release was determined to be a hose rupture while transferring ammonia from the tanker truck to the storage vessel [40CFRpart 68.28(b)(2)(I)]. This event would result in the release of just under 70 pounds of ammonia in a few seconds, with very little offsite consequences as the facility is located in a relatively remote area.  The probability of this event happening is extremely low because of precautions taken by the ammonia supplier to ensure the integrity of the hose and precautions taken by Texaco to ensure proper hookup including:\n7 Utilizing a hose rated at 2000 psi as compared to a system pressure of 100 psi.\n7 Daily inspection of the hose by the ammonia supplier\n7 Double checking the hose connection made in the field by the truck driver and Texaco to ensure a proper connection, and\n7 Use of the hose for only five years instead of the allowed seven years.\n\n\nD.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n \nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the SEKR Cogen.  Because the ammonia process at the facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation:  The SEKR Cogen encourages employees and affected contractors to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prev"

Process Hazard Analyses - Element 3 of the facility Process Safety Management Plan establishes a program to systematically examine and identify potential hazards, controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n \nThe SEKR Cogen has used both a fault-tree and the HAZOP system for evaluating the hazards of the process, or performing Process Hazard Assessments (PHAs).  The analyses were conducted using a team of people who had operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and environmental health and safety expertise. The teams identified and evaluated potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  All resulting suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures were implemented.  \n \nThe PHA team findings were forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings was based on a relative risk ranking assigned by"

The final resolution of each finding was documented and retained.  \n \nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures: The SEKR Cogen maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations.  These procedures are collected within Operating Procedures - Element 4 of the facility Process Safety Management Plan.  Procedures exist for  (1) cold startup, (2) performing rounds, (3) emergency shutdown, (4) normal operations, (5) normal shutdown, (6) startup following an emergency shutdown, (7) startup following turbine startup, and (8) monitoring of ammonia offloading.  In addition, a procedure is also in place for performing regular maintenance and surveillance of the process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes.  In addition, the SEKR Cogen maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  \n \nTraining: To complement the written procedures for process operations, the SEKR Cogen has implement"

The program is outlined within Training - Element 5 of the facility Process Safety Management Plan. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors: The SEKR Cogen uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:  (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. These activities are outlined and described within Contractors- Element 6 of the facility Process Safety Management Plan.   In addition, the SEKR Cogen evaluates contractor safety programs"

SEKR Cogen's audit program is detailed in Compliance Audits - Element 13 of the facility Process Management Safety Program. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n \nThe ammonia process at the SEKR Cogen presents hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of ammonia from the facility.\n \nUniversal Prevention Activities: The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the ammonia process at the SEKR Cogen.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \nPreventive Maintenance: Maintenance and testing of the ammonia system components assures safety for the plant personnel and the public.  Maintenance and testing of equipment in the ammonia system is in accordance with the SEKR Cogen ammonia system maintenance procedures.  The procedures involve scheduled inspections and testing for the storage vessel, the relief and excess flow valves, the sensing switches, and all associated safety equipment. \n \nDesign and Construction Features: The system design philosophy for the SEKR Cogen focused on minimizing the risk of an ammonia release by assuring conservative design of the system components.

A very detailed and comprehensive procedure is in place and followed for the off-loading of Ammonia, as a leak or accident during off-loading activities is considered the most likely type of incident the facility could encounter. \n \nMonitors and Alarms: The ammonia system is monitored and controlled by a digital computer based control system.  The control system responds to changes in temperature, pressure, level and flow to maintain these process variables within predetermined limits.  The computer initiates alarms when conditions are not at or beyond process limits to alert the operator.  The computer also initiates corrective actions or equipment shutdown.  The operator may assume manual control of the process at any time.  Manual control by the operator does not bypass any safe operating shutdowns.\n \n\nE.

Emergency Response Planning\n\nThe SEKR Cogen maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  \n \nThe emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or management.  The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel of  the changes.\n \nEmergency response for the SEKR Cogen has been coordinated with the Kern County and City of Bakersfield Fire Departments and the Region 5 Inland South Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The SEKR Cogen has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, Police or Sheriff office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n \nThe SEKR Cogen, as part of Texaco's Kern River Operations, conducts periodic emergency drills in conjunction with local emergency response organizations.  The drills provide refresher training for employees and responders.\n \n \nG.
