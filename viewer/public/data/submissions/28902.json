We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n-    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n-    A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n-    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n-    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n-    An overview of our emergency response program\n\n-     An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, contractors, the public, and the environment\n\n\n1.2    Texas City Refinery Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces automotive fuels and chemical feedstocks from petroleum using a variety of processing operations.  In our processes, we handle ten RMP-regulated flammable substances and a variety of regulated flammable mixtures in our 11 RMP-covered process units.\n\nWe handle only one RMP-regulated toxic substance above the EPA threshold quantity; hydrofluoric (HF) acid is used as a catalyst in our HF Acid Alkylation Unit to produce high-quality gasoline blending components.

      "SummaryText": "s\n\nMAP LLC Texas City Refinery performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated flammable or toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  MAP LLC Texas City Refinery does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like MAP LLC Texas City Refinery.  Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities.  It is also available to local residents and businesses.  For some of these events, we have emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they occurred.  In all cases, if such events occurred, we would activate our emergency response plan to respond to the event, notify local authorities, and take appropriate actions to protect our employees, contractors, and people in the community.  The paragraphs below briefly describe the scenarios we have included in our risk management plan.\n\n    Worst-case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a failure of the hydrofluoric (HF) acid storage tank in our HF Acid Alkylation Unit.  If such a failure released the maximum inventory of the tank (350,000 pounds), the HF acid would vaporize, resulting in a toxic exposure hazard in the downwind area that would extend outside of the boundary of the refinery.  As specified by EPA, this analysis assumes that all of the HF acid is released to the air and no credit is taken for operation of our HF acid vapor mitig"

The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 3,800,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Because there are some public receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members of the public at those closest locations.\n\n        Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nOur alternative release scenario for toxics involves a release of HF acid from a truck unloading hose.  This would result in a release of 950 pounds of HF acid in the 10 seconds required to isolate the hose, thereby stopping the release.  Our analysis showed that the resulting HF vapor cloud would reach only slightly beyond the refinery property boundary, and would be unlikely to result in toxic exposures to more than a few people.\n\nThe alternative release scenario in our risk management plan for flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a failure of a propylene/butylene railcar unloading hose.  The line failure would release about 35,000 pounds of flammable material in the 20 minutes time required to isolate the release.  The analysis assumed that all of this material would be involved in a vapor cloud explosion and showed that the resulting overpressure from the explosion would barely reach across the refinery property boundary; few public receptor locations would be affected.\n\nAs stated previously, we have included details regarding these scenarios in the additional information submitted to EPA with this executive summary, and have shared that information with the LEPC, other organizations "

Our RMP-regulated processes are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  We have extended the PSM program at this facility, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n \nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, contractors, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.  We are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The following paragraphs briefly describe the key features of our prevention program.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Texas Refining Division encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigations, and audits.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Texas Refining Division accident prevention program.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe Texas Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Texas Refining Division periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Texas Refining Division maintains written pro"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Texas Refining Division are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Texas Refining Division has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in facility information documents.  The Texas Refining Division ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe Texas Refining Division also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Texas Refining Division operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Texas Refining Division has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Texas Refining Division operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (i.e., through tests, skills demonstrations, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Texas Refining Division uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Texas Refining Division evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Texas Refining Division personnel periodically monitor/audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Texas Refining Division conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Texas Refining Division has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Texas Refining Division has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Texas Refining Division promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Texas Refining Division management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 y"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audit.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Texas Refining Division management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Texas City Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  As part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n(    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in the LPG Storage Areas, HF Acid Alkylation Unit, Gas Concentration  Unit, #5 Topper Unit, and Platformer Unit\n* Hydrofluoric Acid detectors with alarms in the HF Alkylation Unit and adjacent Merox unit.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate process materials to prevent overpressure damage to equipment\n\n* Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the processes\n\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n* Rapid HF de-inventory system to permit removal of the process inventory in the event of an imminent HF release\n\n* Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where needed (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process contr"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n1.5    Five-year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  For each of these incidents, we have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nTexas City Refinery has experienced NO accidents during the past five years involving regulated substances from RMP-covered processes that had any reportable onsite or offsite effects.\n\n1.6    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe MAP LLC Texas City Refinery maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our written program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, contractors, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposu"

Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities  and affected personnel are informed of/trained on the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Texas City Refinery is coordinated with the Texas City-LaMarque-Hitchcock local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and with the Texas City emergency management officials.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  We have around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, we conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.  Thus, our emergency response plan is fully coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe MAP LLC Texas City Refinery constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program s"
