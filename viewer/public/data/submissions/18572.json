The nearest major intersection is West main located approximately 2 miles Northwest of the facility.\n\nThe facility recycles by-products from the beef, poultry, and pork processing industries.  In addition, the facility recycles by-products from butchers, grocers, and restaurants.  The finished products include tallow, meat and bone meal, and yellow grease.  Finished products are stored in aboveground tanks and silos.  The plant operates 24 hours/day, six days a week from Monday to Saturday.\n\nOdorous air emissions from the processing of the above-mentioned by-products are captured, delivered, and treated through a wet scrubbin system at the facility.  The system uses chlorine as an oxidant to destroy the organics that are odor productin.  The facility also uses chlorine for wastewater and water treatment."
