We are currently amending the Emergency Response Plan to the format of the One Plan currently used by most federal, state and local response agencies.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n1. We install an new Emergency Notification System (E-Notify) to speed notification of off site locations and residential areas of a chemical spill or release.\n\n2. We have installed VOC and Flammable detection systems in the Op Wax Process and Poly-isobutylene Process and are considering plant areas where remote detection would provide plant personnel early warning of leaks in remote areas of the plant and process.\n\n3. Installed a new process control system that will allow us to have true batch control and improve our safety response time to process variations and help prevent spills and releases."

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and   adversely   affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility Toll Manufactures Polyols, Polymers and Co-Polymers using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1. All storage tanks are equipped with level and pressure transmitters and alarms.\n\n2. All storage vessels are minimum 15 psig rated, automatic pressure controls and rupture disks are provided to prevent tank rupture due to overpressure.\n\n3. All reactors used in Allyl Alcohol or Propylene Oxide service have redundant pressure relief valves that vent to a 16,500 gallon liquid knockout vessel prior to venting to the plant flare. This prevents a release of liquid from the flare due to any upset conditions. All vessels and reactors in the OP Wax Process vent flammables to the plant flare.\n\n4. Reactor vessels in Allyl Alcohol, Propylene Oxide, OP Wax Polymerization service have control interlocks for raw material flow, temperature, high pressure, differential temperature and pressure, agitator operation and Cooling Water pump operation. These all serve to prevent release due to upsets or uncontrolled reactions.\n\n5. Stor"

Storage of Propylene Oxide is limited to 80% of full volume administratively and 85% maximum volume by automatic level control devices. The storage vessel level is lowered to a maximum level of 3,000 gallons or less between product campaigns and where practical the tank is deinventoried when not in use.\n\n7. All reactor vessels and piping are pressure and vacuum tested prior to project startup as part of the Safe Operating Procedure.\n\n8. Fugitive emissions testing is conducted on all equipment in VOC service on a minimum of a quarterly basis.\n\n9. Ethylene storage and transfer operations comply with the industry standards for Ethylene Storage and we plan our production to prevent long term Ethylene storage and the vessel venting that occurs as the Cryogenic Ethylene warms. Isobutylene is handled in this same system observing the same industry standards used for Ethylene.\n\n10. We have added flammable gas sensors and a warning system to detect and warn employees when a flammable gas such as Ethylene has been released due to leaks or failure.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.
