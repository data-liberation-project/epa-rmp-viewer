HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in \n\n\n\nour Accident Prevention Program are constantly changing.  To minimize rework, we selected May 1, 1999 as the date to begin collecting this information.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date may not be reflected in the data element information.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant Accident Prevention Program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accident Prevention Program are documented in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each Accident Prevention Program element.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives underway that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified operating envelopes, i.e., documented safety related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).  \n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for \n\n\nevaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by Exxon Research and Engineering and Exxon Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.

This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES AND SAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Exxon Baton Rouge Chemical Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3) normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\n"
