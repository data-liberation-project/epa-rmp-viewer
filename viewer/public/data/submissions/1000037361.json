              "Description": "SuperValu's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental ammonia releases. The plan includes a regular preventive maintenance program ( mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for  safe work practices (such as  safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety  requirements for contractors who may be hired to operate or work on the refrigeration system. Supervalu also has a procedure in place for investigating incidents to ensure root causes are indentified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure  for conducting compliance audits  to ensure the PSM program is being implemented at the facility. Lastly, the PSM written program incorporates the SuperValu Quincy facilities emergency response plan and places special emphasis  on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emmergecy response organizations.",

The SuperValu Refrigerated Distribution Center # 080 located at 1400 Gadsden St. in Quincy Florida employs over 100 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhyrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and OSHA regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119  Process Safety Management (PSM). SuperValu's Quincy DC stores and use anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. SuperValu's Quincy DC has not  experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment. Pursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, SuperValu has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry Standard What-If / Checklist Analysis developed through the international Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the facility, along with corporate personnel and the refrigeration contractors who installed the system as well as expereineced facilitators from an outside engineering firm (PRT).   SuperValu's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia.

As part of the RMP requirements , SuperValu undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences  of the accidental release of ammonia form the largest vessel in the system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. Supervalu is committed to  minimizing the accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Quincy DC. Facility management is involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the system.  SuperValu employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management has committed to working with local agencies and the community regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community.  Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at SuperValu should be addressed to SuperValu's Environmental Affairs Department. SuperValu has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requirements imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
