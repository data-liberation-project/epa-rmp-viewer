      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis updated RMP covers the storage and use of chlorine at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) water treatment plant (WTP) and use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant at the Climatic Firing Facility (CFF). The temporary storage and transfer of phosgene (R&D Testing) was discontinued during the last quarter of 2007 and has been removed from the RMP. The storage and use of chlorine at the APG wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was replaced with ultraviolet (UV) disinfection in March 2016 and has been removed from the RMP. \n\n\n\nFacility Background:\n\n\n\nThe APG located approximately 30 miles north of Baltimore, Maryland and 50 miles south of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland.  44,000 of those acres are either wetlands, or under water, including portions of the Bush and Gunpowder River and the Chesapeake Bay.  The APG comprises two areas, the Aberdeen Proving Ground Aberdeen Area (APG-AA) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area (APG-EA), which are 15 miles apart by land.  The APG is home to more than fifty tenants and numerous satellite activities.  Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC); U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC); U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) which includes the U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.S. Army Health Command; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD); and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).\n\n\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nThe APG is committed to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibility.  The APG follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.  \n\n\n\nRegulated substances\n\n\n\nChlorine and anhydrous ammonia are currently the only"

Chlorine is used and stored at APG's WTP and is present over the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant in an industrial refrigeration system for the CFF. The refrigerant charge exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold quantity. As a refrigerant it is not consumed but recycled through the closed system. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe APG has a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  APG's PSM Plan addresses safety in the workplace by identifying related work processes and assuring all safety measures required are followed.   The ICP describes additional procedures and regulations followed by various APG offices in preparation for response to a hazardous materials incident.  The ICP is included in this document by reference.  The following is a list of specific standards followed:\n\n\n\n29 CFR 1910.119  Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n29 CFR 1910.120  Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\n\n29 CFR 1910.38   Employee Emergency and Fire Protection Plans\n\n\n\n40 CFR 110    Discharge of Oil\n\n40 CFR 116    Hazardous Substances, Designation of\n\n40 CFR 117    Hazardous Substances, Reportable Quantities\n\n40 CFR 300    National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan\n\n\n\nPL 92-500    Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended\n\n\n\nNFPA 471    Recommended Practice for Responding to Hazardous Material Incidents\n\nNFPA 472    Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous Material Incidents\n\n\n\nEO 12088    Federal Compliance with Pollution Standards\n\n\n\nDODD 5030.41    Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Prevention and Contingency Program\n\nDODD 6050.8    Storage and Disposal of Non-DOD Owned Hazardous or Toxic Materials on DOD Installations\n\n\n\nAR 200-1    Environmental Protection and Enhancement\n"

In addition, FESD is a member of the local community response network with mutual aid agreements in place to assist or be assisted by other fire departments, including the Harford County Hazardous Material Emergency Response Unit.  Emergency response personnel participate in addressing major regulations (such as the RMP) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.  Policy for the FESD is defined by Army Regulation (AR) 420-90 which adopts the National Fire Protection Association codes for operation.  \n\n\n\nThe most recent Chemical Accident Or Incident Response And Assistance (CAIRA) exercise at APG was held on May 18, 2015.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes:\n\n\n\nBefore 2011 a number of accidental release prevention steps have been taken to improve the safety and reliability of the chlorine systems.  The chlorine distribution systems were converted to vacuum systems with controls that will stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a pipe break or similar equipment failure.  Additionally, the amount of on-site chlorine was reduced substantially.  A variety of physical security measures are in place at all facilities, to include patrols by armed security forces to prevent unauthorized access.  APG is committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the RMP, and no significant changes to the system are currently planned. The ammonia refrigeration system at the climatic firing facility is a new installation constructed and installed to the latest engineering design and"
