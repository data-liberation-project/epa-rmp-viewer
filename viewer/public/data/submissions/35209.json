The Reddy Ice plant located at 5050 SW 51st Street in Davie, Florida produces, packages and distributes ice products to south Florida.  The facility employs approximately 49 people.  The facility typically operates one-two shifts per day, 5-days per week, 52-weeks per year.\n\nThe system described in this submittal is the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system utilized by the facility to produce and store ice.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a Hazardous Chemical subject to regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The purpose of this submittal is to provide an initial registration for the facility's Risk Management Program, as required by the Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals rule, as stated in 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe nominal refrigeration system charge is 15,550 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The design and construction of the system is in accordance with the applicable guidelines and recommendations of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia has been safely used in the United States and worldwide as an efficient refrigerant for decades.  Design, maintenance, repair, and operation of the system are conducted in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals).  The system is continuously monitored and inspected by technicians who are qualified and trained in accordance with the requirements of the facility's Process Safety Management Program.  These operators continuously monitor the system for any indica"

Any indication of deviation from process set points or leaks would result in the immediate isolation of the problem area from the remainder of the system and prompt repair.  In the event that a leak should occur in the system in spite of precautions taken, the ammonia detectors will sound an alarm to alert the operators.  The system is equipped with redundant controls to assure that the system operates safety.\n\nThe facility's Process Safety Management Program includes employee information and training, process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews for system changes or additions, and safe work practices.  Contractors working on the system are pre-qualified based on safety performance.  \n\nReddy Ice has implemented an Emergency Action Plan to be followed in the unlikely event of an accident or release.  This Emergency Action Plan describes the notification protocol to be used in the event of an ammonia release.  The notifications in the event of a sudden release of over 100 lbs of ammonia would include the local fire department, the South Florida Regional Planning Council, District XI (Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC), the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center.  The LEPC and Fire department are provided with copies of the Emergency Action Plan upon request.  Facility personnel have been trained to respond to incidental releases that may occur in the system and to provide technical support to the Fire Department in the event of an emergency release of ammonia from the system.  The facility has made arrangements with outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident response drills.\n\nThe facilit"

The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.\n\nThe facility had a small release (less than 100 lbs.) of ammonia on January 5, 2000 as a result of equipment failure.  EPCRA and CERCLA notifications were made as a precaution upon discovery of the release.  As a precaution, operations were ceased, the facility was evacuated and the neighboring residences informed by door-to door notification.  Two company employees were injured and one offsite elderly individual allegedly suffered a heart attack during evacuation.  The system was inspected and corrective actions, including system modifications were taken to prevent this type of incident from recurring."
