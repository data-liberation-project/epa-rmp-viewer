              "Description": "PWD has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.  The program complies with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 and is analagous to RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  This program has been very successful as evidenced by the fact that the plant has never experienced an accidental release that requires reporting under EPA's RMP rule.  See 40 C.F.R. 68.42.  To comply with the RMP rule, the plant has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focus - protection of the public.",

Portland Water District (PWD) is committed to operating the Sebago Lake Water Treatment Facility in Standish, Maine in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  PWD has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases at the facility.  PWD has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the facility to respond to potential releases.\n\nB. The primary chemical used at the facility is chlorine.  Potable water for Portland Water District customers is pumped from Sebago Lake and treated at the facility.  Raw water pumped from the lake is treated with ozone as a preliminary step in disinfection.  A secondary step of disinfection occurs with the addition of chlorine and ammonia.  Water is delivered to Portland Water District customers via gravity feed from the water treatment facility.  Chlorine is the RMP covered substance at the facility.\n\nC. PWD is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE. PWD has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Standish Fire Department and the Cumberland County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for more extensive releases.\n\nF. PWD has a very strong safety program both at the plant and throughout the organization.  Additional changes planned to improve safety at the plant include the elimination of the chlorine process.
