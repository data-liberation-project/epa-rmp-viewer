The Facility occupies an approximately 190,000 square-foot structure that is located on 9.15 acres of land. The Facility was originally built in 1965 and was refurbished by RPC in 2012 to accommodate operations. The Facility operates normally 5 to 7 days per week, 24 hours per day, depending on product demands.\n\n\n\nThe Facility manufactures doughnuts, which are frozen for shipment. The Facility's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 31141 (Frozen Food Manufacturing)\n\n\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system to freeze the doughnuts for shipment, the Facility handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical as defined in the USEPA's CAPP; OSHA's PSM standard; CalOES' CalARP program, and the Cal/OSHA PSM standard in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold  for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Facility is registered to Program Level 3 under both the CAPP and CalARP programs.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Facility's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect Associates and the community as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Facility's prevent"

RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Facility's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility. It is our policy to provide a healthy and safe work environment. This facility follows operating practices that safeguard all associates and result in safe working conditions while maintaining eff"

Management is committed to maintain a high level of interest in health and safety throughout this facility. This commitment extends to the associates and their involvement in preventing accidents.\n\n\n\nRPC has established its Health and Safety Program to insure that:\n\n\n\n?    Associates work in a healthy and safe environment.\n\n?    Associates are trained on safe work practices.\n\n?    Associates practice safe work habits.\n\n?
