The facility has in place the following for the ammonia refrigeration system: preventative maintenance procedures and records, automatic alarm systems, ammonia detectors\n\nand ventilation system, process safety information tracking logs, automatic system shutdown capabilities, periodic leak and pressure testing, periodic visual inspections, control valves, refrigeration hand service valves for manual operation, solenoid valves, pressure relief valves, computer generated work orders for maintenance, and hot work permits.\n\n\n\nThe facility's administrative procedures are as follows: periodic training for associates, compliance audits, pre-startup safety checks, process hazard analysis to address what-if scenarios and the measures taken to mitigate a release, screening of all contractors performing work on the ammonia refrigeration system per OSHA and USEPA regulations, and management of change procedures.\n\n\n\nCompressors have the following safeguards: pressure and temperature gauges on suction and discharge piping, high and low temperature alarms and shutdown, high and low pressure alarms and shutdown, high and low level oil alarms and shutdown, high and low oil temperature alarms and shutdown, high and low oil pressure alarms and shutdown, thermosyphon oil cooling, discharge stop/check valve, suction valve (i.e., combination stop/check/strainer valve), electronic overload protection with alarm and shutdown conditions, and pressure relief valves.\n\n\n\nThe intercooler has the following safeguards: dual pressure relief valves, high and low level alarms and shutdown, continuous level controller, and liquid level sight glass. Evaporative Condenser has the following safeguards: dual pressure relief valves, liquid level indicator, water pump startup and shutdown, and high pressure over-ride. High pressure receiver has the following safeguards: dual pressure relief valves, level column with level indicator and level sight glass, and high and low level alarms and shutdown.\n\n\n\nEvaporators have the following safeguards: high and low level alarms and shutdown, temperature controls, liquid level alarm and shutdown, liquid level gauge, pressure relief valves, high and low pressure alarms and shutdown, emergency stop switch, and pressure and temperature gauges on suction and discharge piping. Plate and Frame Chiller: high and low level alarms and shutdown, temperature controls, liquid level gauge, and high and low pressure alarms and shutdown.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has installed an emergency UPS power supply and a diesel-fired emergency electric generator. These allow the refrigeration control system to remain powered during a power failure, which allows the entire ammonia detection system and the emergency ventilation systems to continue to function.\n\n",

The Facility occupies an approximately 190,000 square-foot structure that is located on 9.15 acres of land. The Facility was originally built in 1965 and was refurbished by RPC in 2012 to accommodate operations. The Facility operates normally 5 to 7 days per week, 24 hours per day, depending on product demands.\n\n\n\nThe Facility manufactures doughnuts, which are frozen for shipment. The Facility's North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 31141 (Frozen Food Manufacturing)\n\n\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system to freeze the doughnuts for shipment, the Facility handles quantities of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance/highly hazardous chemical as defined in the USEPA's CAPP; OSHA's PSM standard; CalOES' CalARP program, and the Cal/OSHA PSM standard in an amount exceeding the regulatory threshold  for anhydrous ammonia in a single process, i.e., the Site's refrigeration system. The Facility is registered to Program Level 3 under both the CAPP and CalARP programs.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is contained in various vessels, accumulators, piping, and heat exchangers throughout the refrigeration system. The Facility's engine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\n\n\nWhile there are few long-term environmental consequences to ammonia use, it can present health hazards if handled improperly. RPC has developed a comprehensive safety program in compliance with OSHA and EPA requirements to ensure the responsible management of the ammonia onsite (the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program, respectively). All refrigeration Associates receive operator training, safe work practices training and training on the standard operating procedures (SOPs). Safety meetings are conducted to further protect Associates and the community as a whole.\n\n\n\nThe Facility's prevent"

RPC's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards. An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system. Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike. The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has incorporated many safety features in the design of the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Facility's ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shutdown pump and the components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, additional locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.\n\n\n\nRPC considers the health and safety of each Associate as its most important responsibility.
