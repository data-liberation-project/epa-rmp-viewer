      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nLouis Dreyfus Commodities Grand Junction, LLC\r\n\r\nLouis Dreyfus Commodities Grand Junction, LLC (LCD-GJ) is an ethanol manufacturing plant that began operation on April 26, 2009. The plant is designed to product up to 125 million gallons of ethanol per year from corn.    \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nLDC-GJ has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility and its equipment.\r\n\r\nLDC-GJ's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The four ethanol tanks and the denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not migrate off-site and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  LDC-GJ has coordinated with the Grand Junction Fire Department for emergency response assistance.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant is located near Grand Junction, Greene County, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline), which is considered a flammable mixture.  The LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The maximum radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.7 miles.\r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 95,026 pounds of ammonia creating a to"

Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.   For the flammable mixture the worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 710,653 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.7 mile radius.\r\n\r\nAlthough the LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\r\n\r\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, A Process Safety Management program has been implemented at this facility.\r\n\r\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  For the flammable mixture, the ARS is the release of 550,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the center of the facility.  The ammonia ARS is the toxic release of 4,780 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 1.3 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within these radiuses that would be affected by both alternative releases.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nLDC-GJ has had no significant releases of any covered chemical in the past 5 years. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nThe LDC-GJ Ethanol Plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An integrated Facility Response Plan and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan ha"
