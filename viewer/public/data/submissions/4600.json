These policies are to be enforced through \ncompliance with applicable regulations, physical safeguards, training, and deployment of \nadequate resources.  MCB, Camp Lejeune gives accidental release prevention and emergency \nresponse the highest priority.\n    The Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 required the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) to formulate regulations for managing and reducing the \nprobability of the release of highly hazardous chemicals.  On June 20, 1996, EPA \npromulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68).  The RMP rules requires \nany stationary source utilizing greater than a specified threshold quantity of a regulated \nsubstance to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan to regulatory authorities on or \nbefore June 21, 1999.  Regulated substances include 77 air toxics and 63 flammable gases \nor liquids.\n\n    MCB, Camp Lejeune, has four processes subject to EPA RMP regulations:\n    \n    * Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Holcomb Boulevard water treatment \n        plant (WTP) (Bldg. HP-670);\n    * Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Hadnot Point WTP (Bldg. HP-20)\n    * Chlorine storage, handling, and use at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), \n        New River WTP (Bldg. AS-110); and\n    * Chlorine storage and handling at the open storage area (Lot 201).\n\n    Chlorine is the only substance at MCB, Camp Lejeune in excess of its threshold \nquantity established in 40 CFR 68.130.  The threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 \npounds.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers and used in the treatment of drinking \nwater at the three WTPs.  Historically, as many as 180, 150-pound cylinders of chlorine \nhave been stored (not used) at Lot 201 prior to being transported to Base swimming pools \nfor chlorina"

However, the number of cylinders stored at Lot 201 has decreased \nsignificantly since MCB, Camp Lejeune recently switched from chlorine to sodium \nhypochlorite for disinfection at all Base pools.  Sodium hypochlorite is not subject to the \nEPA RMP regulations.  Chlorine storage at Lot 201 is planned to be discontinued by \nDecember 31, 2000.  The Courthouse Bay and Onslow Beach water treatment plants that continue to use \nthe 150-pound cylinders will store the material onsite in amounts well below the RMP \nthreshold quantity of less than 2,500 pounds.\n\nHazard Assessments\n\n    The modeling methodology used in this study conforms to the RMP Offsite \nConsequence Analyses (OCA) Guidance recommended in the final RMP rule.  The \nrelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*CompTM, an accidental release dispersion \nmodeling package developed by the CAMEO Team at the Hazardous Materials Response \nand Assessment Division, NOAA, and the Chemical Emergency \nPrevention and Preparedness Office (CEPPO) of the EPA.  All hazard assessments had \noffsite impacts.  \n    The worst-case scenario (WCS) for the three WTPs is a catastrophic release of \n2,000 pounds of chlorine gas.  This scenario assumed a container valve failure releasing \nall of the contents of the one-ton container over a 10-minute period.  No administrative \ncontrols or passive mitigation measures were taken into account for the release.  The \ndistance to the toxic endpoint of 3 parts per million (ppm) was 1.3 miles under worst-case \natmospheric conditions.  The WCS for Lot 201 modeled the catastrophic failure of one, \n150-pound chlorine cylinder over a 10-minute period.  No administrative controls or \npassive mitigation measures were taken into account for the release.  The distance to the \ntoxic endpoint of 3 ppm was 0.4 miles.\n    The alternative release scenario (ARS) for the three WTPs modeled the full \nrelease of a single, one-ton container due to a hole in the piping from the container.  The \nrelease was modeled over 2"

No administrative controls or passive mitigation \nmeasures were taken into account for the release.  The excess flow valve on the stand-by \ntank was considered active mitigation.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was \n0.2 miles.  The ARS for Lot 201 entailed the release of 150 pounds of chlorine gas due to \na hole in the tank.  The release was also modeled over a 20-minute period.  No \nadministrative controls, passive mitigation, or active mitigation measures were taken into \naccount for the release.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release History and Prevention Program\n\n    No accidental releases resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \non-site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property \ndamage, or environmental damage have occurred in the previous five years from the \ncovered processes at the three WTPs or Lot 201.  Moreover, no accidents have ever \noccurred resulting in this type of damage or human impact. \n    All four chlorine processes are subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and have offsite \nimpacts in the case of accidental release.  Therefore, MCB, Camp Lejeune has developed and \nimplemented a RMP compliant with all Program level 3 process requirements established by \nEPA.  \n    An emergency Response Plan (ERP) has also been developed and implemented for all \nfour chlorine processes.  The purpose of the ERP is to promptly respond to a chlorine \nrelease to minimize injuries, lessen the impact in the community, minimize environmental \nimpacts, and provide guidance to local emergency response personnel.  The ERP contains \nprocedures for emergency response after an accidental chlorine release due to equipment \nfailure, accident, or bomb threat.  The plan includes procedures for notification"

This \n\"One-Plan\" will consolidate all emergency and contingency plans at the Base and will meet \nall the requirements for the ERP in the EPA RMP rule.\n    As part of MCB, Camp Lejeune's RMP, a Process Hazard Analysis \n(PHA) was conducted at all four chlorine processes.  The PHA involved a systematic \nevaluation of the hazards posed by each process and risk reduction recommendations were \nmade.  Based on these recommendations, money has been programmed to upgrade the chlorine \nstorage facilities with temperature controlled structures, dedicated chlorine alarms, fire \nprotections equipment, and improved chlorine storage area access.  This project has an \nexpected completion date of December 1, 2000."
