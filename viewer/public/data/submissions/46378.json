If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Shawnee Fire Department, as well as the Allen County LEPC, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification to the local Emergency Management Services and St. Rita's Hospital.  This facility maintains a trained fire brigade and hazardous materials response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Buckeye Terminals, LLC., - Lima South Terminal is a bulk gasoline storage facility, including butane blending operations.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and two 87,659 gallon storage tanks.  The facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's two manifolded 87,569 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (92.4% at 60 Degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1PSI overpressure) extends off-site 0.7miles and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facility's alternate (most likely) release scenario is a \"pull away\" accident resulting in one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site, but does not affect residential areas.  The Buckeye Terminals, LLC - Lima South Terminal complies with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.
