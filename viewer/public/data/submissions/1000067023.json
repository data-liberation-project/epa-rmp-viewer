The site is not a responding facility for releases of the RMP listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\n  \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n\n\nThe Springfield facility manufactures adhesive systems for use in a wide variety of products from aerosols to structural adhesive films. The facility has five (5) regulated substances in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program. 3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances, and 3M contributes to safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment, and maintenance. \n\n\n\nThe following processes and associated regulated chemicals are used at Springfield - 3M Company for the manufacturing of semi-finished and finished products: \n\n\n\n     Bulk Storage Tank (Level 1 - Toxic)\n\n?         Toluene diisocyanate (26471-62-5)\n\n     Bulk Tank and Containers (Level 3 - Flammable) \n\n?         Pentane (109-66-0)\n\n?         Propane (74-98-6)\n\n?         Dimethylether (115-10-6)\n\n?         Isobutane (75-28-5)\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\n\n\nFor the Bulk Tank and Containers process, the Springfield facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.  The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\n-  Employee Part"

Additional details related to emergency procedures are located in the facility's emergency action plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\n\n\nThe facility completed a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the Pentane Tank 7/27/2017 and the Propellant Tanks 8/24/2017 which identified several recommendations for enhanced process safety.  These recommendations are summarized in the PHA report and are currently under evaluation.\n\n\n\nThe Springfield facility develops an annual Environmental, Health, and Safety Plan (EHS Plan) utilizing sources of data such as Injury and Illness Records, Incident Investigation Reports and Incident Rates, Operational Improvement and Safety Suggestions, Safety Tours, Audit Findings, and Self Assessments. \n\n\n\nA yearly analysis is conducted to prioritize issues extracted from the data sources. Action items are then developed, including target completion dates and assignments to individuals and teams. The resulting EHS Plan is approved by 3M Springfield and corporate management teams.\n\n"
