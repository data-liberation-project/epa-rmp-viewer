Standing Instruction PSM-2 that describes the Management of Change procedure also contains a roadmap to assist the user in finding the process safety information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is the Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA.  The PHA is performed to identify hazards in a process. Through this process, information is obtained that will help improve process safety and system reliability, as well as reducing the potential consequences of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Because of the size and complexity of many of the refinery processes, the HAZOP methodology has been selected as the most appropriate PHA method in conducting the PHA for each process.  A HAZOP team at LAR typically consists of a process engineer, an experienced operator, an instrument & electrical engineer/technician, a mechanical engineer, and other part-time team members.  The team leader (a.k.a. the HAZOP facilitator) is fully knowledgeable in the proper implementation of the HAZOP methodology.  Part-time team members typically provide specialized expertise in areas such as safety and health, and equipment inspection/metallurgy/corrosion.  Standing Instruction PSM-3 summarizes the LAR procedure for conducting PHAs.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe LAR provides written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: process startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  The operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The LAR takes steps to update the procedures to reflect current operations and the procedures are certified annually by the operating staff.  In addition, operating procedures are updated when the"

The training program consists of both job skill (qualification) and safety training.  The qualification training programs are described in the Standing Instructions of O-43 (Operation Training Policy) and M-41 (Maintenance Training Policy), which clearly establish the goals and objectives that the refinery wishes to achieve with the employees.  The LAR provides initial training to new hires and regular refresher training to the refinery employees.  The job skill training is presented in various forms and degrees and is dependent on the skills required for the employee's job or position.  The purpose of this training is to elevate the aptitude and knowledge of the operation and maintenance personnel of the process control and technology used and the equipment operated in the refinery.  All employees, including maintenance and contractor employees, involved with highly hazardous chemicals and regulated substances are provided with safety training.  The goal of the safety training is to provide information to the workers so they will understand the recognized hazards of the processes and chemicals that they work with and around.   \n\nContractors\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has established the Contractor Safety Program (Standing Instruction SAF-30) as a screening process that helps identify and select contractors who will perform work in and around processes that involve hazardous chemicals.  Such contractors must have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and certifications for the job tasks which they are being employed.  For contractors whose safety performance on the job is not known, the LAR obtains information on injury and illness rates and references regarding the contractor.  An evaluation is also conducted of contractor work methods and experiences.  Thus, contractors without safety programs or with unac"

Changes are defined as modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, or processing conditions other than replacement in kind\u00bf.  \nPSM-2 includes modifications in the operating procedures that contain operating parameters such as pressure limits, temperature ranges, flow rates, and other process variables.  The Management of Change procedure also covers changes in process technology and changes to equipment and instrumentation.  Changes in process technology can result from changes in production rates, raw materials, experimentation, equipment unavailability, new equipment, new product development, change in catalyst and changes in operating conditions to improve yield or quality.  Equipment changes include, among others, change in materials of construction, equipment specifications, capacity, piping pre-arrangements, experimental equipment, computer program revisions, and changes in alarms and interlocks.  \nTemporary changes are also subject to the management of change provisions in PSM-2 and the procedure also insures that the equipment and operating procedures are returned to their original or designed conditions at the end of the temporary change.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\nA pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is carried out in conjunction with an MOC or a new project or construction.  The PSSR is conducted before implementing a modification to a process, or commissioning a new project.  \nAs it is LAR practice to conduct a PHA for various types of changes and for all new projects, there could be some recommendations resulting from the PHA that are required to be addressed before implementation.  A PSSR is carried out in the form of a checklist to comply with requirements of the applicable regulations.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nA mecha"

LAR also reviews the maintenance programs and shutdown schedules to determine if there are areas where breakdown maintenance is used rather than an on-going mechanical integrity program.  Elements of the mechanical integrity program are as follows: (1) categorization of equipment and instrumentation, (2) inspection and testing program, (3) maintenance program, (4) documentation, and (5) quality assurance program.\n\nHot Work Permit\nAll non-routine work, and some routine work, conducted in process areas at the refinery are controlled using specific company instructions, described in the Standing Instructions SAF-4 (Hot Work Permits), SAF-3 (Safe Work Permits), and SAF-5 (Entry Work Permit). Although the three permit programs are mutually dependent, the regulations only specify the Hot Work Permit which is discussed below.\nA hot work permit describes the steps that operating, maintenance and contractor personnel must follow to obtain the necessary clearance to perform different types of work involving hot surfaces, flame, or energized equipment.  The hazards identified for the work being performed are communicated to those personnel performing the work and also to those personnel who may be affected by the work being performed, especially when the work being performed could affect the safety of the process.

It applies to the investigation of different types of incidents that may occur in the facility.  The intent of an incident investigation is to identify the cause of incidents and to prevent or minimize their recurrence.  A multi-disciplinary team is assembled to gather the facts of the events and to identify, to the extent possible, the cause of the incident.  Team members are selected on the basis of their training, knowledge, and ability to contribute to a team effort to investigate the incident and usually include an operator from the area where the incident occurred.  The operator\u00bfs knowledge of the events can help to identify and verify relevant facts about the incident.  It is the goal of the investigation to treat all involved individuals in a fair, open and consistent manner.  The incident report, its findings and recommendations are entered in the incident investigation tracking system, which can be accessed by all employees, and also distributed to others who can benefit from the information.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIn compliance with Shell's corporate policies, the refinery has implemented an Environmental, Health, and Safety Compliance Assurance Program.  The program helps to verify that LAR's programs and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Every three years, the refinery undergoes an Environmental Audit, a Health and Safety Compliance Audit, and PSM/RMP Compliance Audits  conducted by Shell Corporate staff.  The audit approach includes the following steps: (1) pre-audit preparation, (2) on-site field review, and (3) post-audit follow-up.

The ERP has included a set of potential incidents that are used for emergency drills, including accidental release of toxic gases (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide), accidental release of flammable materials resulting in a fire and explosion, and accidental spill of hazardous materials on the ground within the refinery perimeter.  \n\nLAR uses an Emergency Management Organization, known as Incident Command System (ICS), to respond and manage incidents.  The ICS has a hierarchical (chain of command) structure, which places the highest responsibility on the Emergency Manager, who has the overall responsibility for the emergency.  The Emergency Manager delegates direct command responsibilities to the Incident Commander, who has the highest authority during an emergency.  The Emergency Manger is a liaison between the Incident Commander, the public, and the Company.  The next level of responsibility resides on four section chiefs: Command Chief, Operations Chief, Planning Chief, and Logistics/Finance Chief.  All section chiefs receive directions from the Incident Commander during an emergency.  Each position in the organization has specific assignments and responsibilities, which are defined in the ERP.  The ICS is expanded or contracted to meet the needs or requirements of an emergency.  As the scope and complexity of an emergency expands so does the Incident Command System.\n\nThe refinery has a three-tier emergency activation system in place.  A Level 1 emergency is defined as an event, which can occur at a local work area (e.g., a unit), with minor consequences to health or property, which would not have an impact on the other units in the refinery.

A Level 3 emergency is triggered when life and property are endangered or when the emergency could result or has resulted in offsite consequences. \n\nLAR maintains an industrial fire brigade, which consists of three emergency response (ER) teams, specialized in rescue, hazardous materials, and spill containment.  Each ER team is lead by a captain and consists of six to nine members.  External sources provide assistance in the form of alerting the public, evacuation, transportation, and providing hazard mitigation equipment, supplies, and personnel to complement LAR capabilities. It should be emphasized that external assistance is requested only during a Level 3 emergency.  In addition to these sources, LAR has coordinated with the local hospitals, clinics, and doctors about the properties of the various types of hazardous materials processed and handled at the refinery.  All ER team members, ER team captains, and asset safety coordinators are required to attend quarterly onsite training.
