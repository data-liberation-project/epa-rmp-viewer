In August of 1995, Bozzuto's completed construction of a state of the art warehouse distribution center.  Among its advantages, this distribution center utilizes the benefits of ammonia as a refrigerant. Bozzuto's does recognize ammonia as a potentially hazardous chemical, and this was a consideration when selecting the refrigerant for the facility. In consideration of the risks associated with the use of ammonia, Bozzuto's commits its efforts to ensuring the employees and surrounding community continue to enjoy a healthy and safe environment.  \nPart of this commitment includes:\n- Employing only skilled refrigeration technicians;\n- Contracting with only experienced ammonia refrigeration contractors;\n- Coordination with the Cheshire Fire Department;\n- Partnering with a hazardous materials release contractor; and\n- Maintaining communication with the Cheshire Town Manager, the designated Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nAccidental release prevention is the approach Bozzuto's has taken to minimize and possibly eliminate the potential for an accidental release.  Bozzuto's exercises ongoing preventive maintenance and equipment integrity procedures.  Some of theses program include:\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\n- Hazard Communication, and\n- Lockout / Tagout.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBozzuto's maintains a twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week coverage of trained Security Officers.  If an emergency were to arise, the notifier will dial an emergency extension and be connected to a Security Officer. The Security Officer will gather the information and initiate the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nHaving this continuous coverage reduces the response time in an emergency"

Accidental release prevention programs include:\n- Process Safety Management / Risk Management,\n- Hazard Communication, and\n- Lockout / Tagout. \n\nThrough a Process Hazard Analysis, Bozzuto's uses a hazard and operability study to identify potential accidental release conditions.  Solutions are then developed to prevent or limit these conditions from happening.\n\nIf an incident were to happen, an investigation would take place, and new procedures would be implemented so a similar occurrence could be prevented.\n\nAll Bozzuto's prevention programs are audited at regular intervals to validate their effectiveness; the objective is to be proactive in preventing accidental releases, not reactive.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBozzuto's is proud of the fact there have been no accidents related to an ammonia release since startup in 1995.  With the current practice of education, preventive maintenance, and commitment, Bozzuto's strives to minimize the potential for any accidents in the future.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe Bozzuto's facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM/RMP regulations.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the facility will evacua"

The trained emergency responders in association with the local emergency responders (Chesire Fire Department) will respond to any releases at the facility. The Bozzuto's facility coordinates emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBozzuto's is continually looking for new ways of improving the safety level of its employees and community.  Bozzuto's continues to work with an experienced hazardous materials spill contractor.  The intention of the partnership is to provide Bozzuto's additional specific expertise in the field of hazardous materials release procedures and prevention.  Continuing discussions and exercises are planned to ensure an efficient and prompt response time.\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Bozzuto's, facility.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  Bozzuto's is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
