The plant's products are used primarily to make sputtering targets for the electronics industry and powder metallurgical parts.\n\n\n\nOne of the materials used by the facility is titanium tetrachloride, which is on the RMP Rule's list of regulated substances.  The Honeywell Salt Lake City plant's storage and use of titanium tetrachloride exceeds the specified threshold 2,500 lbs., as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for the Honeywell Salt Lake City plant:\n\n\n\n(1)     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Honeywell Salt Lake City plant to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety, or environmental risks related to its operations; by designing its processes to protect people, property, and the environment; by conducting and continually reviewing and improving programs for safety, health, and environmental excellence; and by establishing processes to assure that all laws and regulations applicable to its operations and products are known and observed. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policy associated specifically with Honeywell Salt Lake City's use of titanium tetrachloride involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the processes, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response plans, maintenance of emergency response equipment, coordination with local emergency response services,"

The manufacturing process includes the utilization of titanium tetrachloride.  Titanium is produced by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride using sodium.  Further processing of the titanium includes crushing, leaching, rinsing, drying, and product sizing.\n\n\n\n(3)  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nHoneywell Salt Lake City pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations. Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.  The employees at Honeywell Salt Lake City are committed to the safe and reliable operation of the plant in a manner that safeguards life, health, property, and the environment.  The process safety and risk management initiatives are implemented as proactive approaches to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nHoneywell Salt Lake City has evaluated titanium tetrachloride systems based on the EPA's guidelines.  Additionally, the titanium tetrachloride systems were built in accordance with the design code and specification as recommended by a supplier.  The supplier has over 20 years experience in the storage and handling of titanium tetrachloride.  The systems include many built-in safety devices including level alarms, high-level cutouts, safety vents, spare vessels for holding material, and pressure relief devices.  In addition, a foam spray system is installed at the offloading and bulk storage to mitigate fume emission in the event of a release; video cameras are installed to allow remote monitoring, and smoke detectors to allow early detection of a release.\n\n    \n\nHoneywell Salt Lake City has established specific guidelines and procedures for compiling and maintaining written information for the chemical processes we operate."

The plant's hazard communication program communicates the health and environmental effects of chemicals to our employees.  We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of our processes.\n\n    \n\nEach chemical process is analyzed utilizing a method designed to identify, prevent, and minimize the effects of hazards such as a fire, chemical release, process control, and explosions.  The utilization of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) techniques has been applied at Honeywell Salt Lake City for many years.  The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their affects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\n\n    \n\nWritten operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions, and emergency response. Standard operating procedures and checklists are in place and are updated as needed. \n\n\n\nBesides standard operating procedures, Honeywell Salt Lake City has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators.  Operators performing titanium tetrachloride operations must be certified.
