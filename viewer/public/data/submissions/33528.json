      "SummaryText": "The City of Sparks operates the 40 million gallon per day Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility (TMWRF) which serves the City of Sparks, the City of Reno and the major portion of the Truckee Meadows.  The process uses chlorine as disinfection for effluent water before discharge into the Steamboat Creek.  Chlorine is stored and off loaded from two 17 ton tankers that are supplied by chemical contractor.  The management of the City has made chlorine safety a top priority and will be removing chlorine from site and use an alternative disinfection product to reduce the potential for chemical exposure.  Removal is to take place sometime after July 1, 2004.  TMWRF complies with the OSHA PSM Program and the State of Nevada Chemical Accidental Prevention Program.  The chlorine system is maintained by an outside contractor and by facility employees and has a caustic scrubber in place in the event of a leak.  We have had several chlorine leaks that were all less than 1 pound per release.  A TMWRF employee was exposed to chlorine gas in a March 2003 event and went to the City Doctor as a precaution, other than that there were no other exposures or injuries to staff or off site citizens, nor were there any type of evacuations.  TMWRF has an incidental release SOP for responding to incidental releases of chlorine.  Any major leak will be reported to 911 and the tanker owner for their response.  Staff responders are trained on the SOP, PPE, monitoring equipment, notification procedures and any other item necessary for a safe response to an incidental release. The alternative release does not affect outside of the storage building as the caustic scrubber is designed to handle such a leak and is tested regularly to ensure operational readiness. The biggest change is that the chlorine will be removed from site after July 1, 2004 as TMWRF will be using an alternative product for disinfection purposes."
