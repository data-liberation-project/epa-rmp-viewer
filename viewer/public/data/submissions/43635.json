We have prided ourselves as good corporate neighbors.  We are very conscious of our neighbors and\nneighborhoods and make every effort to operate a clean, safe, and neat facility.  The owners and employees are all local people \nso we are part of the coommunity.\nShields Fertilizer Co. holds regular safety and training meetings and employees regularly attend association and corporate\nsponsored seminars and training sessions so as to be the best trained and informed personnel as possible.  Employees\nare knowledgable as to what situations and materials may pose a health or environmental problem.  We have discussed\nemergency response by employees, should an accidental release occur eg. Blocking storm drains with front end loaders, which\nway liquids would flow, ect.\nThe police and fire departments are familiar with our facility and with our worst case scenarios.  We have regular \"walk through\"\nwith both departments to keep them informed as to any changes.\nWe have diked all tanks to control accidental releases.  Our aqua ammonia tanks are vented into a water tank to eliminate\nammonia odor during unloading.\nThe worst case scenario for our location would be the release of aqua ammonia.  The liquid would be contained by a concrete\ndike.  The ammonia fumes would be released into the air.  Two tenths of a mile is the furthest drift distance under adverse\natmospheric conditions according to RMP Comp.\nThe maximum amount of aqua ammonia on hand is approximately 76 tons.\nIn our 75 yrars of operation we have never had a release of reportable amounts.  Our plant manager has been employed\nfor over 35 years and is very knowledgable and almost every employee has been here a minimum of four years, we have\nvery little turnover of employees, who are well trained.  One employee is a volunteer foreman and the previous fire chief\nis a goo"
