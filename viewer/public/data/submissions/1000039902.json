The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe management and  employees of  Gavilon Fertilizer, LLC are committed to \n\nthe prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are \n\nencouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. \n\nEmployees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and from time to time include \n\nsections of the management plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, \n\nthe facility is prepared to work with local emergency responders, and other authorities to \n\nmitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and \n\nenvironment.\n\n\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming \n\ncommunity in the area. Anhydrous ammonia, here after referred to as ammonia, is \n\nreceived, stored, and used in the production of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. \n\nAmmonia is an important source of nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and \n\nfall of the year.\n\n \n\nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility's two stationary storage tanks is approximately 192,000 \n\npounds.  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing approximately \n\n40,000 pounds or occasionally by railcar containing approximately 158,000 pounds. From time to time the facility receives ammmonia trucks to use in the \n\n10-34-0 batch process.  Ammonia is unloaded through a transfer \n\nsystem approved by the State of Minnesota Ag department.  \n\n\n\nThe 10-34-0 fertilizer production process (discussed above)is subcontracted to a mobile T-reactor fertilizer production company.  This process utilizes anhydrous ammonia stored in Gavilon's 30,000 gallon ammonia tank in combination with superphosphoric acid to create 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer.  Once the fertilzer is produced it is transfered to a bulk storage tan"

Both the 30,000 gallon and the 18,000 gallon tanks are used by Gavilon personnel to create a variety of agricultural fertilizers in an onsite batch tank.  Anhydrous ammonia is introuduced into a mixing reactor on a weight basis where it is combined with water, powdered chelates, and powerdered metal oxides to produce agricultural fertilizers for farm use.          \n\n\n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n\n   \n\nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards           \n\nInstitute \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" \n\nK61.1, and Compressed Gas Association CGA G-2 for design, construction, and \n\nmaintenance of the process equipment.  The Facility also has a Process Safety  Program \n\nthat dovetails the RMP. The Facility tries to minimize the amount of ammonia held or \n\nstored at the facility through management judgment. All employees involved with the \n\nhandling of ammonia are trained in their duties. The Facility continues to review and look \n\nfor means to improve operating and best management practices for increased safety. \n\n\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n\n       \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility \n\nin  the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property \n\ndamage at the Facility.  \n\n         \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n\nproperty damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the operation of this \n\nfacility.\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\n\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  \"Anhydrous Ammonia Use in \n\nAgricultural\" 1991.\n\n\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  \"Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The \n\nFertilizer Institute.\n\n\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \"Chemical Emergency Preparedness and \n\nPrevention Advisory A?
