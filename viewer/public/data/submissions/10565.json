      "SummaryText": "The Duron Paints & Wallcoverings (Duron) facility located on 10406 Tucker Street in Beltsville, Maryland operates an aerosol canister warehousing process covered by the RMP regulations.\nAerosol canisters containing the propellants propane, butane, and isobutane are stored in the Sundries warehouse and the Campbell warehouse at the Duron facility.  The maximum capacity of the warehouse space at the facility is 55,000 aerosol canisters, each containing up to 14 ounces of material.  The aerosol canisters contain approximately 20 to 30 percent propellants.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.115 (b) (2), for purposes of calculating the TQ of the flammable propellants on-site, the entire 14 ounces of material is assumed to be flammable propellant because each aerosol canister contains greater than 1 percent of each propellant.  Therefore, Duron exceeds the TQ for flammable mixtures of 10,000 pounds.  The warehousing operation is therefore a regulated process covered under the RMP regulations.\n The worst-case release scenario is based on a number of very conservative assumptions.  The worst-case release scenario for the warehousing operation would be an instantaneous loss of maximum inventory the largest vessel resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, with 10 percent of the vapor cloud participating in the explosion.  Release of the total quantity of propane, butane, and isobutane in all of the aerosol canisters would be very unlikely.  Vapor cloud explosions are also unlikely events; in an actual release, the flammable vapor released to air might disperse without ignition, or it might burn instead of exploding, with more limited consequences.\n Using the USEPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the endpoint for a vapor cloud explosion under such a scenario is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The endpoint of 1 psi is intended to be conservative and protective.  An overpressure of 1 psi is unlikely to have serious direct effects on people but may cause struct"

The distance to the endpoint is calculated based on the available combustion energy in the vapor cloud resulting from the worst-case scenario; the vapor cloud explosion of 14 ounces of propane, butane, and isobutane mixture.  The worst-case distance to the flammable endpoint is 0.01 miles.\nThe population potentially impacted by the worst-case scenario (i.e., within a 0.01-mile radius of the tank), based on census data from the LandView IIIb software package, is estimated to be 0 people. There are no public and environmental receptors located within the distance to the endpoint include residential and commercial."
