The Lorton WTP is located on Ox  Road, approximately 1 mile north of Interstate 95. \n\nThe Lorton WTP is a drinking water provider and has a maximum capacity of approximately 52 million gallons of drinking water a day.   Operations at the Lorton WTP fall into the 4941 Standard Industrial Classification.\n\nAt the Lorton WTP, the FCWA pumps, treats, and distributes water from the Occoquan River Reservoir to customers in the Northern Virginia Region.  To ensure the highest quality drinking water is available to its customers, the FCWA uses chlorine as a disinfectant to remove and control the growth of otherwise potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens in the drinking water supply.  Because of its relative toxicity, chlorine is listed as a regulated substances under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.  Under the provisions, EPA requires that facilities having regulated chemical processes above specific threshold quantities implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) covering the regulated process.\n\nThe FCWA's RMP describes the potential environmental impacts and the toxicity hazards presented by the chlorine inventory at the Lorton WTP.  Moreover, the RMP describes the FCWA's procedures to minimize the risk and prevent unwanted releases of the chemical into the surrounding communities.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe FCWA has adopted policies that comply with applicable federal, state, local, and institutional regulations for design, construction,  op"

As directed by EPA regulations, the FCWA assumed a worst-case release scenario to consist of a 1-ton cylinder depleting its contents over a 10 minute release period.  Such a chlorine release would tend to sink, hug the ground, or follow low lying areas due to the fact that chlorine is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air.  Depending on the ambient weather conditions (i.e. wind speed and direction) and the topography of the surrounding land, the chemical plume can impact the surrounding region and cause damage to human health and the environment.    \n\nTo determine how far from the Lorton WTP a chlorine plume would travel from a 1-ton cylinder over a 10 minute release period, the FCWA utilized Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) dispersion modeling reference tables.   Additionally, the FCWA utilized the Fairfax Joint Local Emergency Planning Committee's (FJLEPC) modeling conducted in accordance with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook.  These approaches conservatively estimate a potential impact area that is circular with the center being the point of release.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Chlorine\n\nConsidering that the aforementioned worst-case release scenario is ultra-conservative and unrealistic in terms of the potential impact area, the FCWA is required to conduct an alternate release scenario for chlorine. This variation of the worst-case scenario is considered \"more realistic\" than the worst-case scenario.  The impact area must still include off-site receptors.  However, it is important to understand that although the occurrence of the alternate release scenario is considered as \"more realistic\", the FCWA considers it still t"

Due to no historical off-site releases at the Lorton WTP within the last 25 years, the alternate release scenario selected, although still unlikely, was one identified through the process hazard analysis.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, the alternate release assumed that the largest vessel of chlorine (1-ton cylinder) is released. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n \nThe EPA RMP regulations require each regulated facility to report all accidental releases which resulted in deaths, injury, environmental or property damage, either on- or off-site that resulted in evacuations or in place sheltering  within the last 5 years prior to submission.\n\nThe FCWA has not had any such incidences at the Lorton WTP for chlorine within the last 25 year's operating history.\n\nOverview of the Prevention Program\n\nThe EPA RMP regulations have three tiers of compliance based upon the relative degree of effort necessary to minimize the risk to off-site receptors.  The tiers are established as Program 1, Program 2 and Program 3.  As a rule of thumb, since the FCWA's off-site consequence analysis affected off-site receptors, the FCWA falls into the Program 3 tier requirement.   Moreover, the WTP is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety therefore making compliance with Program 3 criteria mandatory under the RMP regulation.\n\nManagement System\n\nThe FCWA has established a management system to assign responsibility for the development, implementation, and modification of the RMP.  The overall responsibility for implementation is assigned to the Manager of Water Production, with specific responsibilities assigned to management level personnel with organizational responsibility for the individual tasks "

This information is available to all operations, maintenance, and administrative employees for review.  The safety information includes:  \n\n1. Information on chemical hazards, which includes toxicity information, permissible exposure levels (PELs), physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects from mixing.  This is in the form of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) that meet the requirements of 29CFR 1910.1200 (g). \n\n2.

A list of the codes and standards used to design build and operate the chlorine system at the Lorton WTP.\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe FCWA completed a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) for the chlorine  handling system at the Lorton WTP.

Moreover, each employee assigned a safety sensitive function is part of an on-going safety training program.  \n\nMaintenance\n\nThe chlorine system is maintained under the plant's computerized maintenance system known as Tooltime.  As preventive maintenance activities are scheduled, work orders are printed and issued to the responsible craft supervisor.  Should equipment be found in need of repair, either during scheduled PM or at any other time, a corrective maintenance (CM) work order is issued.  Finally, once work has been completed, that information and any other data are entered into Tooltime.  This system permits Lorton WTP to continuously strive for and achieve its goal of \"zero failures\" (i.e., no loss of production and 100 percent resolution of identified safety concerns).\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe ensure compliance with the RMP regulations compliance audits will be conducted to evaluate the FCWA's safe work procedures to determine if their implementation are compliant with the applicable codes and regulations.  The audit also is utilized to identify potential program deficiencies and assist with formulating recommendations to alleviate identified deficiencies.
