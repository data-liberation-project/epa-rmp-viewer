We feel that our worse-case scenario is a train derailment.  This will explain why our worse-case inventory amount is so large.  Our worse-case plan assumes that all storage and nurse tanks will be filled if a derailment occurs. Our employees have been trained in emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. We strive to comply with the Kansas Department of Agriculture rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \r\n\r\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. We have provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA).\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going"
