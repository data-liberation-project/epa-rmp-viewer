      "SummaryText": "EOG Resources, Inc.  Wasco Facility 36\nWasco Facility 36 is located in an rural agricultural industry area in Kern County, California.  Wasco Facility 36 is a crude oil and natural gas production facility which includes a skid mounted natural gas processing unit.  The facility is normally unoccupied and remote.  Production operations personnel visit the facility on a periodic basis.  There are three potential receptors near the facility:\n1.  One occupied residence located approximately 2,000 feet to the southwest of the facility.\n2.  An unoccupied residence and farm related storage shed located approximately 950 feet to the                northwest.  \n3.  Farming activities in the area of the facility are occupied on a seasonal basis.\n\nThe process involves the processing of natural gas through a refrigeration system to produce natural gas liquids (NGL).  The natural gas processing plant is a skid mounted unit manufactured by Process Equipment Corporation.  The unit has a design pressure of 1000 psi; a process design temperature of -10 degrees F and a capacity of 100 - 3,000 MCF/Day.  The process equipment includes the following:\n1.  Free water knockout vessel.\n2.  Three phase separator vessel.\n3.  Stabilizer tower vessel.\n4.  Fuel scrubber vessel.\nThe natural gas liquids are stored in a storage vessel with a capacity of 11,618 gallons of product.  The process produces approximately 292 gallons/day of natural gas liquids.  The product is shipped by tank truck when the storage level reaches 8,000 gallons.   \n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Wasco facility 36 is vapor cloud explosion assuming that the entire content of the storage vessel is released.  The release of 42,000 lbs. of a flammable liquid would result in a vapor cloud explosion with a distance to 1 psi overpressure of 1,471 feet.  The farming activities and the unoccupied residence and shed are located within the 1 psi overpressure distance.  The alternative release case involves a leak in the NGL lo"

The release of 87 lbs. of a flammable liquid would result in a vapor cloud explosion with a distance to 1 psi overpressure of 191 feet.  Farmland directly adjacent to the facility would be within the 1 psi overpressure area.\n\nAll process vessels are protected by presuure safety valves that are tested on an annual basis.  The NGL storage vessel is also protected by a pressure safety valve and redundant shut-off valves on the load lines.  The storage tank is protected from vehicle traffic by fixed barricades.  The access road to the NGL loading point is barricaded while NGL is loaded.  The NGL product load valve and vapor return vlave  are locked and secured at all times except when loading."
