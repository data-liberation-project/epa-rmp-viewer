Typically, each of the acceptable methods will require up-to-date process flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation drawings, and data regarding process materials and conditions.  Certain hazard analysis techniques may require additional, more detailed materials.\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted with the clear goal of identifying potential hazards.  Recommendations may be made with the intent of reducing or eliminating a potential hazard .  Items of concern also may be identified for further, more detailed study.\n\nThe follow-up phase involves evaluating the proposed recommendations to determine the appropriate course of action. the action taken may include:\n\n7         Accepting and implementing the recommendations as made;\n\n7         Accepting  the recommendations in principle but developing an alternative approach to meet the intent; or\n\n7         Accepting the current situation and not implementing the recommendation.  The current situation may be the course of action taken if there appears to be no technically feasible solution for the situation identified, if any recommendation considered would pose additional, more serious hazards, or if it is determined that the reduction in risk is no"

Is a public cold storage / frozen food facility. The prime Refrigerant used is Anhydrous Ammonia in a closely controlled and monitored environment. The Refrigeration system is Computer controlled with built in safeguards which is monitored 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year. The facility has personal \"on call\" at all times that are trained and qualified to handle any emergency situation that may arise. The system is monitored in each Room that the process takes place by a computer linked detection system.  \n     Ammonia is a self-alarming substance with a distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in health risks). The Department of Transportation classifies ammonia as a non-flammable. Ammonia will burn however, but only in a very narrow and high range of concentration with high temperature. \n     The U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) has made a determination on the permissible exposure of ammonia to people. The maximum allowable exposure for eight hours is 50 PPM (parts per million). \n\n\nWorst case Scenario\n\n     The worst case scenario of ammonia spill at the Benson, NC facility was chosen to be a vessel r"

This type of analysis applies to and is required for every hazardous (toxic & reactive) chemical listed in section 1910.119.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) shall include, but is not limited to the following items:\n\n1. The hazards of each process; both chemical and mechanical hazards should be noted.\n\n2. Identification/examples of previous incidents which did, or could have become, catastrophic.\n\n3. The used or site available chemical detection methods.\n\n4. Consequences of loss of system/process control.  Factors causing loss of control should include both operator and mechanical error/malfunction.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nI. Employer shall perform an initial PHA on all ammonia equipment.  PHA's shall be done as soon as possible and in order of relative danger to personnel and equipment that a failure would cause (Required schedule is 100% complete by May 26, 1994).\n\nII. The employer shall use one or more generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the process hazards: What If/Checklist, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis, or other appropriate equivalent methodology.\n\nIII. The PHA shall address:\n\nA. Hazards of the process.\nB. Identification of any previous incident which did or had a likely potential for causing catastrophic consequences in the workplace.\nC.
