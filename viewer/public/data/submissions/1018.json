This type of analysis applies to and is required for every hazardous (toxic & reactive) chemical listed in section 1910.119.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) shall include, but is not limited to the following items:\n\n1. The hazards of each process; both chemical and mechanical hazards should be noted.\n\n2. Identification/examples of previous incidents which did, or could have become, catastrophic.\n\n3. The used or site available chemical detection methods.\n\n4. Consequences of loss of system/process control.  Factors causing loss of control should include both operator and mechanical error/malfunction.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nI. Employer shall perform an initial PHA on all ammonia equipment.  PHA's shall be done as soon as possible and in order of relative danger to personnel and equipment that a failure would cause (Required schedule is 100% complete by May 26, 1994).\n\nII. The employer shall use one or more generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the process hazards: What If/Checklist, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis, or other appropriate equivalent methodology.\n\nIII. The PHA shall address:\n\nA. Hazards of the process.\nB. Identification of any previous incident which did or had a likely potential for causing catastrophic consequences in the workplace.\nC. Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the process (controls, alarms, detection equipment, etc.)\nD. Consequences of failure.\nE. Facility siting.\nF. Human factors.\nG. Qualitative evaluation of the range of safety and health effects of failure of controls.\nIV. PHA shall be performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operating and the PHA methodology being used.\n\nV. The employer shall promptly address the team's findings and recommendations and document actions taken or scheduled to be completed.  The employer shall communicate"

Retain PHA information and updates along with all supporting documentation for the life of the process.\n\n PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nContent of Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis comprises three parts: 1) preparation (Operating Procedures,\nP & ID's, PSI, etc.), 2) conducting the hazard analysis (PHA Worksheet), and 3) follow-up actions resulting from the hazard analysis (PHA Action Items).\n\nThe preparatory phase for a process hazard analysis requires the gathering of date, drawings, procedures and formation of a team.  Typically, each of the acceptable methods will require up-to-date process flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation drawings, and data regarding process materials and conditions.  Certain hazard analysis techniques may require additional, more detailed materials.\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted with the clear goal of identifying potential hazards.  Recommendations may be made with the intent of reducing or eliminating a potential hazard .  Items of concern also may be identified for further, more detailed study.\n\nThe follow-up phase involves evaluating the proposed recommendations to determine the appropriate course of action. the action taken may include:\n\n7         Accepting and implementing the recommendations as made;\n\n7         Accepting  the recommendations in principle but developing an alternative approach to meet the intent; or\n\n7         Accepting the current situation and not implementing the recommendation.  The current situation may be the course of action taken if there appears to be no technically feasible solution for the situation identified, if any recommendation considered would pose additional, more serious hazards, or if it is determined that the reduction in risk is no"

Is a public cold storage / frozen food facility. The prime Refrigerant used is Anhydrous Ammonia in a closely controlled and monitored environment. The Refrigeration system is Computer controlled with built in safeguards which is monitored 24 hrs a day, 365 days a year. The facility has personal \"on call\" at all times that are trained and qualified to handle any emergency situation that may arise. The system is monitored in each Room that the process takes place by a computer linked detection system.  \n     Ammonia is a self-alarming substance with a distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in health risks). The Department of Transportation classifies ammonia as a non-flammable. Ammonia will burn however, but only in a very narrow and high range of concentration with high temperature. \n     The U.S. Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA) has made a determination on the permissible exposure of ammonia to people. The maximum allowable exposure for eight hours is 50 PPM (parts per million). \n\n\nWorst case Scenario\n\n     The worst case scenario of ammonia spill at the Benson, NC facility was chosen to be a vessel r"

The RMP Ammonia Program Plan document was closely followed to ensure compliance.\n     As a result we have found that should a catastrophic incident occur. There would be very limited private residences in the areas of release.\nThe worst case release of Anhydrous Ammonia would come from a rupture of the high pressure vessel that is located in the machine room. The amount of the release in the study was 10,000 pounds. The release rate is 1,000 pounds of ammonia per minute in a ten-minute period. With a 1.5 MPH wind. The distance to the end point equals .10 mile. There are no Schools, Hospitals, Prisons, or Recreation areas within the scope of this model. Along with the consideration to public receptors. Environmental considerations are. National and state parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and federal wilderness areas.  None of the Environmental Considerations listed above are a factor in this report. \n\nAlternative release Scenario\n\n     The alternative release scenario of Anhydrous Ammonia at the  Benson, NC facility was chosen to be a rupture from a pipe. We have conducted our own modeling as guidance for this report using the same guidelines as in the Worst case scenario. \n     The conclusion of this study has found the same results as in the Worst case scenario. The amount of release that is used is 2  pounds. The rate of release is .2 lbs./min. And the release duration is 100 minutes. The wind speed is 1.5 MPH.
