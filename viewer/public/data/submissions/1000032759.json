This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCopano Field Services operates the Houston Central Gas Plant located in Colorado County,\n\nTexas. Texas Gas Plants, L.P. is the owner of the facility. The gas plant receives produced\n\nnatural gas via pipeline. Residue gas is removed from the plant by pipeline. The hydrocarbon\n\nliquids are fractionated at the Houston Central Gas Plant and the fractionated products are\n\nshipped out via pipeline.\n\n\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic\n\nsubstances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, Copano identified\n\nthe regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\n\n\n\nThe only listed toxic substance which is stored above threshold quantities at the Houston\n\nCentral Gas Plant is chlorine. There are three separate containers of chlorine, with a capacity of\n\n2,000 pounds per container. The TQ for chlorine under CAA Section 112(r) is 2500 pounds.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Houston\n\nCentral Gas Plant are distillate, propane, natural gasoline, rich/lean oil, n-butane, raw make,\n\nisobutane, and sponge oil. However, Copano has determined that rich/lean oil and sponge oil\n\nhave a NFPA flammability hazard rating of 1, which exempts these mixtures from threshold\n\ndetermination.\n\n\n\nThe Houston Centra"

Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process\n\nsafety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from\n\nupdating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a\n\nmember of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information\n\ncreated as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees\n\ncan be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee\n\nparticipation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention\n\nprogram element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address\n\nprocess safety and employee safety issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help\n\nmaintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and\n\nassociated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and\n\nequipment design basis/configuration information.

The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\n\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information\n\nis supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any\n\nknown hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process\n\nareas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters\n\n(e.g., temperature, level, composition). The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained\n\nwithin these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained\n\npersonnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards\n\nassociated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each\n\nprocess is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are\n\nin place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP/What If analysis technique to perform these\n\nevaluations.

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\n\ndemonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner\n\non their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive\n\nrefresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are\n\nmaintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three\n\nyears. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that\n\nthe operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Houston Central Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of\n\nincreased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near\n\nprocess equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1)\n\nperform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are\n\naware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of\n\nan emergency, (5) understand and follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant\n\npersonnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing\n\ncontractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3)\n\nemergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning\n\nwork. In addition, the Central Houston Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and\n\nperformance durin"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure\n\nthat safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for\n\nstartup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to\n\nmake sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting\n\nsystems are operationally ready.
