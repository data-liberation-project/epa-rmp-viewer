The Shoremont facility uses chlorine to disinfect the water supply before it is distributed to customers throughout Monroe County and beyond.  The facility receives chlorine in one-ton cylinders and stores between 4 and 15 cylinders (8,000 to 30,000 pounds) at any given time, with a maximum inventory of 23 cylinders (46,000 pounds).  The chlorine is stored in a secured room, in which the cylinders are connected to the disinfection system.  The area is equipped with a monitoring system which is designed to detect chlorine at 0.1 parts per million (ppm).  In the event of a release from the system, the monitoring system would activate the emergency caustic scrubber (at a 3 ppm concentration).  The scrubber is designed to reduce the chlorine emissions from a full one-ton cylinder to a maximum of 15 ppm at the scrubber outlet.\n\nMCWA developed a prevention program and an emergency response program as part of the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) program created to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, developed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The facility contracted with an outside consultant to review and update the prevention program and emergency response program to meet the requirements of RMP.  MCWA is also an active participant in Monroe County's Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) county-wide RMP task force.  The prevention program was developed from the facility's existing OSHA PSM program, which addresses the required elements of the RMP rule.  The sections were updated as necessary to meet and/or exceed the requirements of the RMP rule.\n\nThe Shoremont facility goes to great lengths to promote safety and awareness of the risks associated with chlorine.  MCWA mandates health and safety trai"
