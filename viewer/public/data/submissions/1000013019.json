Overall, the facility employs 41 full time employees.\n\n1.    The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\nMI is committed to operating the Ferndale Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, MI has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Ferndale Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Ferndale Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Ferndale Plant consists of the following three elements:\n    \n-    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n    \n-    A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n-    An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nMI limits the use"

When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, MI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new or modifications of existing processes. \n\nMI strives to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  MI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, MI requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of employees with regard to these operating procedures.  The Facility has an established Management of Change (MOC) procedure for all new or revised products.  MI's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances. \n\nMI's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release. In the event of an accidental release, the Ferndale Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment. MI utilizes emergency response plans as required by federal regulation.  MI trains its workers to respond defensively to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.

In fact, the plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.  In order to effectively implement these policies, MI established a management system headed by the Environment, Health and Safety (EH&S) Manager to oversee safety and environmental related activities.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(d))\nSince 1997, the Ferndale Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1997, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde handling and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  The plant is no longer subject to OSHA PSM because the formaldehyde solution has a concentration less than 37% formaldehyde.\n\nIn 1996, the EPA RMP rule established another level of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the fence line.  Program 3 of the EPA RMP applies to formaldehyde.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Ferndale Plant's Program 3 prevention program that addresses EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n3.1.    Program 3 Prevention Program\nThe Ferndale Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n3.1.1.    Process Safety Information\nThe Ferndale Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  The plant ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the LEPC, and the Ferndale Fire Department.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.

In addition, MSDSs for products stored in amounts exceeding applicable thresholds are provided to the LEPC and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.  The available information includes: \n\n-    Operating parameters\n-    Block flow or simplified process flow diagrams\n-    Process chemistry\n-    Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, or flow\n-    Consequences of deviations from established operating limits\n-    Piping and instrumentation diagrams, including materials of construction\n\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects or, in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analyses of the process.  Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used to (1) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, and (3) help maintain the equipment.\n\n3.1.2.    Process Hazard Analysis\nThe Ferndale Plant performs and updates the process hazard analyses (PHA) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes. \n\n3"
