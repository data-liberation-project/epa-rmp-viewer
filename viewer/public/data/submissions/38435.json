The non-integrated mill concentrates on the production of release backing paper and other specialty papers for food packaging and medical applications.  \n\nLakes States, a division of Wausau-Mosinee Paper Corporation, shares the facility with RPC in Rhinelander, Wisconsin.  Lake States is a producer of Torulla yeast.  Following drying and packaging, the yeast is sold.\n\nProcesses conducted at RPC require the use of three regulated toxic substances: chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, and aqueous ammonia, in amounts exceeding the respective threshold quantities.  Chlorine is used at the onsite wastewater treatment plant to disinfect process waters.  The chlorine process is a RMP Program 3 covered process.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at Lake States to make aqueous ammonia which is used as a nutrient in the yeast production process.  The anhydrous ammonia process is a RMP Program 3 covered process.  The aqueous ammonia process is a RMP Program 2 covered process.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nRPC is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with pertinent regulations and good operating practices to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the water treatment and yeast production processes.  If an accidental release were to occur, RPC has response measures in place to minimize the impact of the release.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIn October 2002, RPC performed process hazard analyses for the three covered processes in order to identify potential hazards at the facility.  RPC has several process controls in use such as sight gauges, relief valves, check valves, and response procedures in the event of a release.\n\nRPC has developed a set of operating procedures that are contained within"

These procedures remain current.\n\nRPC has developed a training program to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents during normal operations and emergencies.\n\nWritten procedures have been developed to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  This includes preventive maintenance and inspection procedures, the frequency of such procedures, inspection responsibility, and guidance doucments for these procedures.\n\nRPC's procedure for Management of Change has been incorporated as part of the PSM/RMP program.  RPC has implemented this procedure to ensure that changes are properly reviewed and that hazards introduced by the implementation of the change are identified and controlled prior to placing the change in operation.\n\nRPC has implemented a pre-startup safety review procedure to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and are operational and that other aspects of the PSM/RMP program are updated and implemented as needed prior to placing the equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance audits are a critical component of the PSM/RMP program and will provide management with information on the success of the program and on areas that need improvement.  Audits are conducted every three years to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP standards are being followed.\n\nRPC has developed an incident investigation procedure for incidents involving covered processes.  The purpose of the RMP incident investigation requirement is to ensure that: 1) incidents involving regulated substances are investigated, 2) recommendations for preventing a reoccurrence are identified and implemented, and 3) appropriate personnel are briefed on the causes of each incident.\n\nRPC has instituted an employee participation plan to ensure that employees who may be potentially affected by process operations have knowledge of and ac"

This plan is intended to outline the employee's participation and responsibilities within RPC's PSM/RMP program.\n\nRPC has developed and implemented a Contractor Safety Program to insure that contractors comply with PSM/RMP requirements and implement an effective industrial safety program for work at the RPC facility.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been one accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and no releases of chlorine or aqueous ammonia.  No on-site deaths, injuries, or property damage occurred as a result of the anhydrous ammonia release.  In addition, the release did not result in any known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRPC has developed an emergency response program that contains procedures for:\n\n1) informing the public and local emergency reponse agencies about an accidental release;\n2) documenting first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat human exposures;\n3) emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n4) the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing, and maintenance;\n5) training all employees in relevant procedures; and,\n6) emergency response plan review and update.\n\nRPC employees receive annual emergency training specific to their required response duties.  In addition, the Fire Brigade conducts annual fire fighting and chemical spill reponse drills.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, RPC has an audible alarm system for notifying facility personnel.  Local emergency responders will be contacted by the Emergency Response Coordinator or delegate as needed.  In addition, the Emergency Response Coordinator is reponsible for contacting the appropriate RPC spokesperson to manage public notification.\n\nCHANGES TO SAFETY\n\nThe PSM/RMP Manual documents the required program elements for the covered processes.
