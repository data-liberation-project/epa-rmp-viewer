      "SummaryText": "Aventine Renewable Energy - Mt. Vernon, LLC (Aventine - Mt. Vernon) is an ethanol fuel production plant located near Mt. Vernon, in Posey County, Indiana.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Aventine - Mt. Vernon completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the applicable RMP reporting threshold.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAventine - Mt. Vernon is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the flammable mixture natural gas condensate (RMP-regulated components:  butane, isobutane, isopentane, pentane, and propane), which may be used as the ethanol denaturant, as well as aqueous ammonia.  Both the denaturant and the ammonia are stored in secondary containment to minimize the potential for off-site migration of spilled material and to allow for prompt response in the event of a material release.  \n\nIt is the policy of Aventine - Mt. Vernon to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of denaturant or aqueous ammonia, it is the policy of Aventine - Mt. Vernon to notify the Posey County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Black Township Fire department and evacuate all employees at the Facility.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe Facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant to render the distilled alcohol unfit for human consumption; denaturant is added to the distilled alcohol at a concentration of approximately 2 percent by volume.  Aventine - Mt. Vernon intends to use unleaded gasoline as the primary denaturant for the f"

      "SummaryText": "acility, which is not an RMP-regulated substance; however, the Facility may, at times, use natural gas condensate, which is a flammable mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated components:  butane (4%), isobutene (1%), isopentane (35%), pentane (45%), and propane (1%).  Aventine - Mt. Vernon is choosing to prepare an RMP for the denaturant process to allow for flexibility of denaturant used at the facility.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 596,600 pounds.  The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the Facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  \n\nThe Facility also stores aqueous ammonia (31% maximum concentration) on-site in an above ground tank located within secondary containment.  Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum ammonia stored will be 164,500 pounds (70,700 gallons of aqueous ammonia at a maximum concentration of 31%).  \n\nAventine - Mt. Vernon has evaluated worst and alternative case scenarios as it relates to each of these reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  Aventine - Mt. Vernon has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nAventine - Mt. Vernon maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of denaturant and aqueous ammonia. The Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is very similar to the prevention program required under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM). Aventine - Mt. Vernon's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include: \n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tE"

Vernon is a new facility and does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  The Facility plans to begin operations the week of November 29, 2010; RMP-regulated substances were present above threshold quantities the week of November 15, 2010.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule. Rather than prepare a complete Emergency Response Plan, Aventine - Mt. Vernon has chosen to maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance to ensure employee safety in the event of an emergency.  In general, the EAP provides procedures for employees to report a fire or other emergency; procedures for emergency evacuation; procedures to for employees who remain to operate critical plant operations prior to evacuation; contact information for employees responsible for communicating plan information; details regarding the employee alarm system; an employee training program for evacuation; and procedures for routine review and updates to the plan.\n\nIn addition, the Facility has coordinated with the Posey County LEPC and is a part of the written community Emergency Response Plan. The Black Township Fire Department will provide first response for all Facility emergencies.  For these reasons, Aventine - Mt. Vernon meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Fac"

Vernon's PSM Program, which is kept on-site as a separate document.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAventine - Mt. Vernon is a new facility and has been built with features to ensure safe operation of both the flammable and ammonia processes.  Aventine - Mt. Vernon completed a Process Hazard Analysis prior to bringing toxic or flammable materials on-site above RMP thresholds.  The Facility is in the process of implementing the changes recommended during the Process Hazard Analysis."
