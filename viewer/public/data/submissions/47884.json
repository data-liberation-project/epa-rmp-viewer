Risk Management Program.\n\nPOLICY\n\nArchimica is committed to operating our facilities safely and in compliance with all applicable regulations.   Archimica considers proper management of Environmental, Safety and Health considerations as an integral component of our business.  All employees are expected to assume responsibility for process safety consistent with their function and level of authority. \n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nArchimica Inc. produces materials for use in pharmaceuticals.  These materials include both intermediate chemicals that are used to produce pharmaceutical active ingredients and the active ingredients themselves.  \n\nThis facility has been in continuous operation since 1947.  It has previously operated under the name Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. and Clariant LSM (Missouri) Inc.  The facility is located on 66 acres and employs approximately 110 people including many scientists and engineers.  The facility operations are regulated by the FDA, OSHA, DEA, EPA, MDNR and Federal, State and local agencies.\n\nHydrogen Chloride (HCl) is used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical intermediate.  The EPA Risk Management Planning Threshold Quantity for HCl is 5000 lbs. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION - HYDROGEN CHLORIDE\n\nHydrogen Chloride in tube trailers is used in a pharmaceutical intermediate manufacturing process at Archimica.  The maximum intended site inventory for HCl in the manufacturing process is two tube trailers (46,200 lbs).    Therefore, this process is subject to Risk Management Plan requirements for hydrogen chloride and Program 3 elements are applied.\n\nHydrogen chloride is stored on-site in the tube trailer(s) used to ship the material to the facility.  Each trailer consists of seven individual cylinders, each containing 3000-3300 lb HCl when full.  Tube trailers are staged in an unloadin"

A water curtain system is installed at the entrance to the unloading room to minimize HCl release to the atmosphere in the event that a leak occrus in the unloading system.    \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nThe site has advanced safety programs that meet or exceed OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  Archimica has developed prevention programs for all regulated chemicals.  The success of these prevention programs is reflected in Archimica?s excellent safety performance.  Archimica?s prevention programs are comprised of technology-, personnel-, and facilities-related elements.\n\nTechnology-related elements include safety systems in the processes (control systems, alarms, interlocks, monitoring systems), process hazards analysis (PHA), operating procedures and safe practices, and management of change (MOC).  These elements are utilized to manage all physical, procedural, and technical changes made on this site.  A plant-wide database is used for tracking MOCs and PHAs.  \n\nFacilities-related elements that significantly contribute to the success of the prevention program include the mechanical integrity program and the pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR). The mechanical integrity program is a comprehensive program that is responsible for equipment compliance with Good Engineering Practices (GEPs), proper equipment preventative maintenance, and equipment quality assurance.  \n\nPersonnel-related elements include formal training and incident investigation.  Both of these programs utilize database systems to maintain and organize records so that site personnel are able to track plant performance in these areas.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn accordance with RMP reporting requirements, Archimica is pleased to report that there have been zero accident"

There have also been no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\n\nArchimica Inc. has established a complete integrated contingency response plan to define the procedures and activities necessary to manage chemical incidents.  All operators and maintenance mechanics complete a 24-hour certified hazardous material training course and conduct emergency response exercises approximately every 3 months.  All shift supervisors complete certified emergency response incident command training.\n\nArchimica works with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Emergency Management Office to support community emergency planning activities.  Joint emergency response exercises have been conducted with the Springfield Fire Department at the Archimica facility to assure the fire department Hazardous Material Teams are familiar with the Archimica site and can work effectively with the Archimica HazMat teams.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nArchimica believes continuous improvement of all environmental and safety systems is crucial to the ongoing success of the company.  Several ongoing safety programs are in place to assure means of improving site safety performance are fully explored.  All incidents are reported and investigated to assure causative factors are identified and corrected.  Plant safety committees meet regularly to discuss safety and encourage employees to voice any suggestions they may have.  These and other programs have resulted in numerous improvements to safety at Archimica and will continue to do so."
