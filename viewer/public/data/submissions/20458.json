This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system To further safety in our facility, the refrigeration system is constructed under permit from local authorities, such as the building and fire departments Additionally, we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we implement a method called Process Safety Management to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained safely\n\nWe use a variety of methods to ensure that accidental releases of hazardous materials are prevented to the greatest extent possible.
