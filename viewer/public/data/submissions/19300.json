      "SummaryText": "Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified end point for the worse case accidental release scenario fir the following process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor:* a catastrophic release from a 55 gallon container. The scenario involves the release of 550# of toulene diisocyanate in a liquid form , whick evaporates in excess of 60 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability and a 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.06 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L. Within the past 5 years , the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule ( 40 CFR 68.10 b 1 ). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of a fire , explosion, or release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifiies that to the best of my knowledge , information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true accurate, and complete."
