      "SummaryText": "Facility and regulated substance handled:\nThe Gibson Generating Station is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Owensville, Indiana.  The Plant uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), a regulated air pollutant.  The attached Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of ammonia used in the SCR system.  The SCR system is designed to inject ammonia gas into  boiler flue gas.  After injection the ammonia/flue gas mixture passes through the SCR catalyst.  The catalyst promotes a chemical reaction with the ammonia in which NOx emissions contained in the flue gas are reduced, converting the ammonia and NOx into innocuous nitrogen gas (the major component of air) and water.  The Gibson Station stores the liquefied ammonia under pressure in five (5) 70,000-gallon storage tanks.  The Station limits filling of each tank to 87.5% of its capacity to prevent overfilling. \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies and programs\nThe Gibson Plant has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the ammonia system that meets or exceeds the requirements of both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR 68).   To ensure safe operation the ammonia storage and handling system was designed to meet or exceed existing engineering standards and codes.   Safety features of the engineering design include emergency shutdown systems, automatic excess flow control valves, process area ammonia detectors, and a dike system capable of containing a release of up to 110% of the inventory of each tank.   The Station\u00bfs release prevention program includes practices and procedures for operating and maintaining the ammonia system, conducting incident investigations, training personnel, and managing change.

      "SummaryText": "Station\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan, which meets OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q)), has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Gibson County. \n\nAccident history and recent changes to improve safety:\nSince the process is newly constructed, there is no accident history.  However, to ensure a safe process, a HAZOP was conducted.  The HAZOP resulted in recommendations for minor design and operating improvements to enhance process safety, all of which were resolved prior to start-up.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s):\nA worst-case release scenario and an alternate scenario were developed and modeled in accordance with RMP regulations.  The Process Hazard Analysis Software Tools (PHAST) program (a model that has been approved by the EPA) was used to conduct the dispersion modeling for both scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The scenario used for this analysis involves a hypothetical tank rupture in which the total quantity in the tank is completely released over a 10-minute period.  The model predicts a distance to toxic endpoint of 2.1 miles, which is based on a number of conservative assumptions set forth by the EPA such as F-class stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and the highest recorded temperature over the past three years (105 \u00b0F).  Population information obtained through the EPA Geographic Query Information System\u00bf (Version 97.1.8) indicates that approximately 130 people live within 2.1 miles of the storage tanks.                                                                                                                \n\nAlternative release scenario:\nIn contrast to the unrealistic worst-case scenario, the alternate scenario involves a more reasonable release from a drain valve that has been left open on a tank"
