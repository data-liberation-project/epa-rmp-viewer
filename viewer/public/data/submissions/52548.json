We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Mankato Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Mankato facility is a pipeline, storage and transport truck loading facility.  The pipeline system is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline system which is regulated by the Department of Transportation.  The propane storage and  loading facilities are regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Mankato Terminal has two pipelines that are routed through the facility and are regulated by the Department of Transportation.  These two pipelines are a part of a mix product line (natural gasoline,"

These tanks are used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.  The previously mentioned propane storage tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed a maximum volume of 80% of each tank's full capacity..\n\nIn our facility we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no listed toxic substances handled by the Enterprise Mankato Terminal and Storage facility..\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into four storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline, or the mixed product pipeline.  This material is routed from these tanks to the truck transport loading docks for whole sale to propane retailers.\n\nA small quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan is used to stench the propane at the truck transport docks.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals handled by Mankato Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals handled by Mankato Terminal. \n\nWorse Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.

All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 30,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  This scenario would be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.

Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Blue Earth County Emergency Management Director, which includes the local Police department, Sheriff\u00bfs Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the emergency notification alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Blue Earth County Sheriff\u00bfs Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the system\u00bfs control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  The Enterprise Houston Control Center has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by Operation.  A third party contractor, 3E is under contract to effectively contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise Products takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.

All of these programs come under scheduled scrutiny and critique.\n\nThere is an on-going inspection program designed to search out and find deficiencies with the process equipment prior to any incident.\n\nThe Operations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Enterprise Products Operating L.LC.

Based on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, this facility has not had an accidental release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility safety is a primary goal at Enterpirse.  The Mankato Terminal promptly addesses safety recommendations from process hazard analyses conducted at the facility.  Safety management program improvements recommended as a result of internal facility program audits are also acted upon to insure prompt correction.  Safety recommendations made by location employees are considered and implemented if the proposal can be shown to improve facility safety.
