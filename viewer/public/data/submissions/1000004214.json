INVISTA's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe LaPorte Plant is operated by INVISTA to produce a series of intermediate chemicals.  These chemicals, including; 1,4 Butanediol (BDO); Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Polytetramethylglocol (PTMEG) are produced then loaded onto trucks and railcars for distribution.      \n\nThe facility consists of two manufacturing areas designated as the THF and PTMEG Units.  The THF Unit uses formaldehyde, above the EPA designated Threshold Quantity, in its process.  Both BDO and THF are manufactured in the THF Unit following a chemical reaction resulting from the combination of  formaldehyde and acetylene.  \n\nAlthough the LaPorte Plant uses several EPA RMP regulated toxic chemicals, formaldehyde is the only toxic chemical that is present in amounts above the EPA threshold quantity.  There are also no RMP regulated flammables in amounts greater than their threshold quantity used or stored at the LaPorte Plant.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n \n\nAmmonia, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid are stored and used at the facility.  These substances are"

Hydrochloric acid (20%) is also stored at concentrations lower than the minimum necessary to be considered an RMP substance (40 CFR 68.130 Table 1).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by INVISTA.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\u00c2\u00bf Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00c2\u00bf Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00c2\u00bf Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe LaPorte Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf Minimizing the possibility that combustion of chemical vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\u00c2\u00bf Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\u00c2\u00bf Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\u00c2\u00bf Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failure"
