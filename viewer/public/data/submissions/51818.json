The critical operations shutdown procedures to be followed by those employees who have been assigned for essential building operations include:\n\nPlant Engineer: Shutdown the ammonia refrigeration system by using one of the Emergency Stop (E-stop) switches located just inside of the engine room doors.\n\nIn response to an ammonia release, D&D Foods will not respond to releases of hazardous chemicals in an offensive manner. The facility does not have any employees trained at the HAZMAT Technicians or First Responders Operations Level.  However, in the case of a minor ammonia release, designated maintenance personnel are allowed to isolate or maintain the release.\n\nD&D Foods has not had any accidental releases to report since the commissioning of the plant.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be failure of the high pressure receiver in the south engine room releasing 6,725 lbs of ammonia (the entire charge) for duration of ten minutes. The receiver is able to hold more than the total charge.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\t\n?\tWorst case weather conditions are uncommon,\n?\tThe vessel is enclosed in a building that would withstand and help to contain such a release\n?\tIndustry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels\n?\tAmmo"

The supervisor of the affected area should immediately contact the Emergency Response Coordinator to determine if evacuation of the plant is the safest course of action.  If the emergency involves the release of ammonia and a decision is made to evacuate the plant, the Emergency Response Coordinator will sound an evacuation alarm, and then determine the assembly area.  The location of the assembly area will be based on the current wind direction and will be upwind of the release area and will be relayed to the Evacuation Coordinators.  If your immediate contact options cannot be reached, dial 911.

These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nD&D Foods is a food processing plant located in Omaha, Nebraska.
