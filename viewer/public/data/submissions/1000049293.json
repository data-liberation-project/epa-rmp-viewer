The Riverside Fractionation Plant also maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained.

Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Riverside Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM.\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\nThe Riverside Plant employs 24 full-time employees on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.\r\n\r\nEnLink Processing Services, LLC (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP 5-year update to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in January 2012 for the Riverside Fractionation Plant.

NGL is received as raw feed via pipeline. The raw feed NGLs are fractionated into butanes and natural gasoline products. N-butane and isobutane are extracted from the raw feed through further fractionation and are stored in pressurized storage tanks prior to being shipped for commercial distribution via pipelines, marine vessels, tank trucks, and/or railcars.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fractionation process, the heaviest portion of NGLs (e.g., pentanes and heavier) results in production of natural gasoline. Natural gasoline is also received by tank trucks as a finished product for future distribution in commerce. All of natural gasoline (produced at the Plant and delivered from other sources) is pumped into one of three floating roof storage tanks. The gasoline is shipped to commercial\r\nmarkets by marine vessel or tank truck. \r\n\r\nThe Riverside Fractionation Plant processing has been evaluated for RMP applicability.
