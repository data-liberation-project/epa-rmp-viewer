      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Grand Rapids WWTP is committed to a safe work place for our employees and for the community we serve. Numerous safety programs are in place at the facility, which include process safety management, preventive maintenance of all equipment, and safety training on a regular basis.\n\n\n2. Facility description and nature of regulated substances handled\n\nThe Grand Rapids WWTP processes over 58 million gallons per day of wastewater. This wastewater is treated to secondary standards and consistently meets all regulatory requirements. The wastewater is disinfected using chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are the basis for the need to submit a risk management plan.\n\n\n3. Measures for preventing accidental releases of hazardous materials\n\nThis facility is required to comply with OSHA PSM requirement. We work with the City of Grand Rapids Fire Department, which provides emergency response in the event of an accidental release. \n\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\nThere have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide accidents at the facility during the past 20 years.\n\n\n5. Emergency response Preparations\n\nThe WWTP has a response plan for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which is incorporated into our process safety management program. At our facility we will rely on the Grand Rapids Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team for emergency response. There are procedures for notifying plant personnel and for notifying the fire department in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nWe are in the process of converting  to Ultra Violet Disinfection. The conversion should be completed by February of 2005. After our conversion the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide will be removed from service."
