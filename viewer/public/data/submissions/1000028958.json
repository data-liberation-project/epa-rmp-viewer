Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is regulated substance by the EPA requireing us to comply with this Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizers for crop production nurtrients.\r\n\r\nOur facility maintains 2 - 30,000 gallon stationary storage tanks on site.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 2-30,000 gallon storage tanks, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), released as a gas over 10 mins, resulting total vaporization. The maximum quanity released would be 140,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. It should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\r\n\r\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe most common alternate release scenario from an anhydrous ammonia storage facility would not reach an endpoint off-site. The alternate release scenarion modeled for the purpose of this plan is a two-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requring a manual shutdown. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds from a storage tank. The distance to the endpoint would have no impact.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELAESE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standard ( 1989 edition), OSHA-29 CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accendetal Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nOur ammonia system is protected from maj"
