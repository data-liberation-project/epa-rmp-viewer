The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThe Deep South Products, Inc./Chek Beverages Plant (Deep South) is a manufacturing facility owned by Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.(Winn-Dixie)  located at Fitzgerald, Georgia.  Winn-Dixie requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  Winn-Dixie's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\n\nDeep South is located at 255 Jacksonville Highway, just east of downtown Fitzgerald, Georgia.  The facility consists of areas for manufacturing and packaging of condiments, oil, jelly, peanut butter, juice, and soft drinks.  On site freezer and cooler storage is provided for perishable items prior to distribution to the Winn-Dixie Warehouses.\n\nDeep South has one ammonia refrigeration system that exceeds the 10,000 lb. RMP threshold quantity.  The compressors and some ammonia refrigeration vessels are located in the compressor room located at the South side of the building.  All the refrigeration equipment except the high pressure receiver and the condensers is located inside the building.  The high pressure receiver (HPR), located under the condensing towers at the east end of the south side of the facility, is the largest capacity vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system.  This vessel is capable of holding approximately 9,734 lbs. of ammonia when filled to 80 percent capacity. This is the vessel that was used for the worst-case scenario analysis.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity in the ammonia refrigeration system for the OSHA Process Safety Manageme"

For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Deep South facilityA?s refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  Deep South will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program for ammonia. \n\nThe Deep South facility has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  In developing the PSM Program, Deep South also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration processes.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, all refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigeration Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) training course.  These measures ensure that all refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Existing safe work practices such as Confined Spaces, Lockout/Tagout, Hot Work Permitting, Line Breaking, and Access Control are reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.\n\nOther components of the PSM program include collection and review of all equipment information, the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of any equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.\n\nTo ensure that the Deep South refrigeration staff has the "

Other PSM procedures, including Employee Participation, Contractors Program, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation are also part of the program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Five-year accident History\n\nThe Deep South facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Deep South facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and is developing a program to comply with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  The current plan has been coordinated with the local Fire Department.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911.\n\n6.   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
