The \r\nfacility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the \r\nspring and summer months. The plant produces fresh, fresh frozen, and thermally \r\nprocessed seafood products.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system \r\nas a refrigerant in freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available \r\nand has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below \r\ndangerous concentrations.  The maximum inventory of ammonia in the plant system is \r\n20,918 pounds. In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in \r\nall cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release. The plant \r\nhas been operating safely since 1962.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenario\r\nA worst-case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Failure of the largest \r\nvessel in the system, the High Pressure Receiver (HPR), when filled to capacity would \r\nrelease 11,781 pounds of ammonia.  The HPR is located in the machinery room.  Based \r\non the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the HPR fails catastrophically, \r\nreleasing its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  To obtain the most conservative \r\nassumption, it is assumed that the building does not mitigate the rate of release, but the \r\nammonia exits to the outdoors via doors and ventilation shafts in the machinery room \r\nroof. The release is modeled using RMP CompTM software.  \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a \r\npotential hazard identified"

In this scenario, a pipe to a plate freezer in \r\nthe cold storage complex breaks resulting in a liquid ammonia release to atmosphere.  \r\nThe release occurs indoors.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures \r\ndocumented in Chapter 4 of the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for \r\nAmmonia Refrigeration (EPA GAR) and calculated by RMP CompTM software.\r\n\r\nRelease Prevention Program\r\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the \r\nrequirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, which is \r\ndesigned to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM program addresses all \r\nrequired elements including employee participation, process safely information and \r\nsystem drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, \r\nmechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard \r\nanalysis, contractor safely, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system \r\nitself has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, \r\npressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check \r\nvalves.  Plant personnel responsible for the system have had extensive training in \r\nammonia systems and hazardous material handling and response. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nPer the requirement of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history \r\nfor all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or \r\nsignificant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, \r\nsheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no \r\nsuch accidents at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM \r\nplan to facilitate"
