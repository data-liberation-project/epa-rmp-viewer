Following the on-site review, the hazard assessment was conducted to determine Maximum downwind distances to the listed concentration (200 ppm for ammonia).  Using these distances, the receptor data (including sensitive, environmental, and public receptors) were collected in addition to the population data within these zones.

This book includes the piping diagrams for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment as well as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Bulletin 109 for this facility.  These forms include physical as well as operational data for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment. \nOn (PSM audit date) a review of the prevention programs was conducted.  This review commenced with the Process Safety Information (PSI) to determine whether there has been any new equipment added or removed from the facility since the most recent revision of the document.  Once it was concluded that the documentation was current, the Process Hazard Analysis study was reviewed to determine the implementation status of any recommendations from the initial study.  Finally, the remainders of the prevention programs were reviewed with the Facility Services Manager to analyze the effectiveness of each program."
