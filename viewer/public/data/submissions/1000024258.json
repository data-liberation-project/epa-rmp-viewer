Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements.\n\nThis document contains the necessary information to satisfy the EPA Risk Management Program regulations for facilities handling in excess of (worst case pounds of ammonia) of ammonia.  This document contains the necessary information to satisfy both the Program and Plan requirements of the RMP regulation. The Plan is the information that will be submitted to the EPA, Section 6.0.  This single submission will be deemed equivalent to a submission to the administrating agency, state, and local planning and response agencies with jurisdiction for the area where the stationary source is located.  The Program is the system that supports the plan and ensures that the plant is being operated safely.  A large portion of the Program information can be found in the Americold Process Safety Management (PSM) program document.  The existing PSM program is referenced throughout this document.  \n\nThis document contains six additional sections as follows:\n\nPrevention Programs        This section lists all the Program 3 prevention programs in place at the facility as well as a brief summary of each program.  These programs are included in the Americold PSM program document.  A review of the programs is also included in this section.\n\nEmergency Response Plan        This section outlines the Emergency Response Plan in place at the facility.

Following the on-site review, the hazard assessment was conducted to determine Maximum downwind distances to the listed concentration (200 ppm for ammonia).  Using these distances, the receptor data (including sensitive, environmental, and public receptors) were collected in addition to the population data within these zones.  Finally, the Risk Management Program and Plan document was developed.Americold,  established a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program at this facility in October, 2011.

This book includes the piping diagrams for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment as well as the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Bulletin 109 for this facility.  These forms include physical as well as operational data for each piece of ammonia refrigeration equipment. \nOn (PSM audit date) a review of the prevention programs was conducted.  This review commenced with the Process Safety Information (PSI) to determine whether there has been any new equipment added or removed from the facility since the most recent revision of the document.  Once it was concluded that the documentation was current, the Process Hazard Analysis study was reviewed to determine the implementation status of any recommendations from the initial study.
