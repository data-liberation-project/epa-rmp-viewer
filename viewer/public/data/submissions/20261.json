This plan has been endorsed by the City staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Dublin Road Water Plant.  The Dublin Road Water Plant has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak.  All personnel involved in handling chlorine are trained with regard to chlorine safety and accident prevention.\n\n'68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the City of Columbus Dublin Road Water Plant Chlorination Facility.  The Dublin Road Water Plant has a design capacity of 65 million gallons per day (MGD) and treats surface water to drinking water standards.  Facilities are provided for the handling and utilization of chlorine in one-ton containers.  The Chlorination Facility is located in the northern half of the Chemical Feed Room and consists of the following areas:  the Chlorine Loading and Unloading Area, the Chlorine Storage Room, and the Chlorine Feed Room.\n\nThe chlorine ton containers are stored inside the Chlorine Storage Area.  The doors and windows in this room are normally kept shut. A monorail and hoist assembly is provided for the handling and transfer of the one-ton containers to the storage facilities from flat-bed delivery trucks or from storage to the scale assemblies for process use.  Provisions are made to house twenty-three (23) one-ton containers of chlorine on trunnions on the floor.  During emergency situations, when chlorine deliveries may be delayed, operators will stack an additional 20 one-ton containers of chlorine on top of the 23 containers on the floor.  The two weigh-scale banks in the Chlorine Feed Room hold 10 containers.  Therefore the maximum intended inventory of"

      "SummaryText": "chlorine at the Dublin Road Water Plant is 53 full one-ton containers of chlorine or approximately 106,000 lbs of chlorine.\n\nThe Chlorine Feed Room is equipped with two weigh-scale banks that can hold five connected one-ton containers of chlorine each.  Normally, one bank has five full containers connected to the manifold/header system with only one of the ton containers of chlorine in service at a time. When the in service container approaches empty, as indicated by a low pressure alarm, the container is shut off and the next full container in the bank is opened and put in service.  Chlorine is fed as a liquid through the system. The manifold piping has an expansion tank with a rupture disk that will relieve pressures in excess of 350 psi in the liquid line.  The liquid chlorine is fed into one of two evaporators.  Normally, one evaporator is in use at a time with the other one on stand-by.  The evaporators convert the liquid chlorine to a gas that remains under pressure as it leaves the evaporator.  It is then dropped to a vacuum at the vacuum regulator.  The facility has one pair of chlorinators designated for pre-chlorination and one pair designated for post-chlorination.\n\nThere are two chlorine leak detectors installed in the Chlorine Feed Room and one in the Chlorine Storage Area to alert the plant staff quickly in the event of a chlorine leak.  The leak detectors are set to locally light at 0.5 ppm and to fully alarm at 1ppm. A full alarm activates an outside horn and beacon, automatically shuts down the building ventilation system, turns on the emergency exhaust system, activates a warning strobe in the control room, and causes the SCADA system to automatically page the operator on-duty.  The leak detectors are tested weekly for cell current strength. \n\n'68.155(c) Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nAs a Program 3 Process with one toxic gas, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario will be addressed for the Chlorination Facility.

      "SummaryText": "ublin Road Water Plant has chosen to use the US EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68), US EPA 550-B-98-010, October 1998, (WWTP Guidance), as a source to determine off-site consequences.  This guidance specifically addresses the chemicals commonly found at WWTPs.  The chlorination process for Water Plants is similar to the chlorination process at WWTPs.  Therefore, this guidance document is applicable to the Dublin Road Water Plant's chlorination process.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).  For the Dublin Road Water Plant facility the worst-case scenario is a total release from one of the one-ton containers of chlorine (greatest amount held in a single vessel) over 10 minutes. This results in offsite impacts. The facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario that reaches an endpoint offsite.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The most likely release scenario was identified based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The alternative release scenario for chlorine that results in offsite impacts is a flashing liquid release through a 5/16 inch opening in a leaking flexible tubing line, valve connection, process piping or equipment.\n \n'68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Dublin Road Water Plant has a documented Prevention Program for the chlorination facility that documents release prevention measures.  These prevention measures include elements such as Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  \n\nAs mentioned previously, the Dublin Road Water Plant is equipped with l"

Also, Dublin Road Water Plant employees who are involved in chlorine operations are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of chlorine at the facility.\n\n'68.155(e) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Dublin Road Water Plant facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years that have resulted in on-site injuries or off-site injuries or other impacts. \n\n'68.155(f) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Dublin Road Water Plant is a non-responding facility, as defined by OSHA and USEPA (29 CFR 1910.120 and 40 CFR part 311).  Therefore the Dublin Road Water Plant has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR 68.90(b).  The Dublin Road Water Plant facility Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a chlorine emergency and has coordinated this plan with the City of Columbus Fire Department- Haz Mat Station 4.  The Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a chlorine emergency.   Dublin Road Water Plant employees are not designated responders to a chlorine release.  As specified in 40 CFR 68.90, Dublin Road Water Plant's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.\n\n'68.155(g) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) in November, 1999.
