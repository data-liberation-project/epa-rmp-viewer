THE ACTIVITY OF THIS PLANT INVOLVES THE STORAGE AND TRANSFER OF THE PRODUCT.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED IS 280,500# AT ANY ONE TIME.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A RELEASE AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE POTENTIAL QUANTITY RELEASE COULD BE 132,000#, WHICH IS THE LARGEST TANK AT 85%-AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS  AS WELL AS COMPANY POLICY.  DISTANCE TO END POINT IS 2.5 MILES FROM THIS PLANT.\nTHE ALTERNATE RELESE SCENARIO BASE ON INDUSTRY INFORMATION COULD BE A RELEASE FROM A PIPE OR TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO END POINT FOR THIS IS .83 MILES.\nTHERE HAVE BEEN NO RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST 5 YEARS RESULTING IN ANY INJURIES, DEATH, EVACUATION, SHELTERING IN PLACE, OR OTHER EMERGECY PROCEDURES.  OUR EMEGENCY PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE RISK TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUNDING PUBLIC, AS WELL AS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.  OUR COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL IN THE INDUSTRY TO IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT ANY PROCEDURES FOR THE BETTERMENT AND THE INTEREST OF SAFETY."
