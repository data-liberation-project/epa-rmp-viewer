Univar supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil & gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome products stored and handled by Univar are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1.  Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA'S Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program.
