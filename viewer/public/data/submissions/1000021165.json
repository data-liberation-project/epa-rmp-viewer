The facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Managment Program rule under the Clean Air Act ammendments of 1990.\n\n  The Risk Management Program rule requires a facility which handles threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to develop a program (if one is not already in existence) to prevent accidential release of these substances and to minimize the consequences of releases that do occur. \n\n  The following is a summary of the Risk Managment Plan for Equalizer Inc. Waco, TX.\n\n  The Equalizer Inc. terminal serves as a storage and distribution terminal for liquid fertilizer products and the blending and distribution of liquid cattle feeds. In addition to storage, blending and distribution, the Equalizer Inc. location is used for the processing of Ammonium-Poly-Phosphate fertilizer using a portable polyphosphate blender. The Equalizer Inc. facility serves as a vital link in the fertilizer distribution system by storing and delivering products in close proximity to central Texas agricultural producers. \nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Equalizer facility that is subject to the requirments of the Risk Managment Program rule. The Anhydrous ammonia is received by rail in pressurized cars when it is quickly processed into liquid AmmoniumPolyPhosphate using a portable T reactor. The AmmoniumPolyPhosphate is stored in above ground tanks until needed by agrcultural producers. In addition to being used as a crop nutriant, the AmmoniumPolyphosphate is used as source of Phosphorus and NPN in liquid cattle feed suppliments.\n\n  It is the policy of Equalizer Inc to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substances and particularly any of a hazardous or regulated substance. Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe opperation of the facility, to the safety of its empl"
