The Buffalo Creek Processing Plant has around the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, LEPC, and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Buffalo Creek Processing Plant is coordinated with the Beckham County Emergency Management office (LEPC).

Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Buffalo Creek Processing Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection \n1) Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel. \n2) Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\nRelease Containment/Control \n1) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \n2) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated). \n3) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature) \n4) Curbing or dykes to contain liquid releases. \n5) Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system). \n\nRelease Mitigation \n1) Fire extinguishing systems for specific equipment  \n2) Trained emergency response personnel. \n3) Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing). \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nIn the last five years, the Buffalo Creek Processing Plant has had no reportable accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nThe Buffalo Creek Processing Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).  The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans,"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Buffalo Creek Processing Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe processes at the Buffalo Creek Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with facility employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nMarkWest encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team. Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nHot Work Permit \n\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Buffalo Creek Processing Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nManagement of Change \n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the specifics of the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nMarkWest conducts a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures \n\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, startup after a turn around, and initial startup of a new process.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u2013 Buffalo Creek Processing Plant \n\nMarkWest Oklahoma Gas Company, L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Buffalo Creek Processing Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Buffalo Creek Gas Plant Processes raw gas from the field gathering system. The unprocessed gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates the condensate and free water from the natural gas stream. The gas is then compressed, CO2 removed, and dehydrated. After this process the gas enters a cryogenic process where it is cooled and the heavy natural gas liquids (NGLs) are removed. The remaining natural gas is sent to sales off site. The NGLs, also known as Y-Grade, are also sent to sales off site.\n\nThe products at the Buffalo Creek Processing Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario, and 40 CFR 68.28 for the alternative release scenario analysis. The worst case and alternative case radi"
