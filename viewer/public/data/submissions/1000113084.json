Efforts are assisted by the Corporate Director of PSM, Corporate Senior Manager: Process Safety management, and the facility PSM Specialist.  All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain coverage of trained Ammonia Refrigeration Operators. Additional support is available via phone from management personnel s well as our contractor partners.\n\nThis facility manufactures frozen Asian foods.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, operating in a 2-stage Carnot cycle.\n\nWorst case and an alternate release scenarios are calculated using RMP*comp and urban conditions. The worst case using EPA guidance assumes the release of the entire charge through a capital vessel. The alternate release guidance utilizes the release of ammonia vapor through the largest relief valve.\n\nThe refrigeration system is covered by OSHA PSM rule, 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThere have been no releases that have resulted in onsite or offsite casualties or offsite evacuations in the last five year reporting period. \n\nFacility personnel are regularly trained in their responsibilities under our Emergency Action Plan. \n\nWe have a very active PSM / RMP Team. They meet monthly to certify policies and procedures, track deficiency items, and generally manage our PSM / RMP program. This team is led by our PSM Specialists. Many facility groups are represented in the monthly meeting including Environmental Health and Safety, Refrigeration Operations (Operators), Refrigeration Management, maintenance management, and general plant operations.\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios have been chosen based upon previous operating experience, evaluation through our Process Hazard Analysis process and industry guidance. The worst case was chosen because it is a plausible scenario (though extremely unlikely)"

      "SummaryText": "resulting in the farthest release radius. The alternate was chosen as a much more likely scenario (though still remote). Per our guidance several scenarios were selected and calculated to determine the correct scenarios to utilize. Records of these alternate scenarios are maintained in our PSM / RMP program files.\n\nWe are constantly improving our safety and compliance systems. We do this through a multitude of means. Our core philosophy is that \u0093compliant systems, start with mechanical sound systems\u0094. We strive to maintain our current equipment through proper preventive maintenance practices developed using manufacturer as well as industry guidelines. As equipment approaches the end of it\u0092s life cycle we strive to replace equipment with newer (safer) designs. Our PSM Specialist is dedicated to maintaining a high level of compliance, often exceeding industry guidance, where deemed appropriate. Safety is central to our compliance efforts. Our facility also has an EHS Specialists who supplements our compliance efforts from a safety standpoint. We have exciting plans over the next few months. We will be removing two capital vessels (an intercooler and a medium temperature recirculation package) and replace them with a single medium temperature recirculation package with built in intercooling. This project will lower our maximum intended inventory and eliminate potential system failure points. Additionally, we are rolling out a modified operator training program. Schwan\u0092s is blessed to have two RAIs (RETA Authorized Instructors). Through their efforts, we continue to provide additional training to our refrigeration operators, with the ultimate goal of having the best refrigeration team in the industry."
