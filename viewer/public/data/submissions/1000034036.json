More important, it is an integral part of a greater commitment by CBE owners, Casco Bay Energy and Dynegy, to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, and the communities they serve.\n\n\n\n2.0  Background Scope Purpose\n\n\n\nCBE is a 520 MW natural gas-fueled electric generating plant, located in Veazie, Maine.  CBE is a new plant that began operating in the spring of 2000.  As part of its air pollution control technology, CBE uses selective catalytic reduction (SCR).\n\n\n\nThe SCR process removes nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases produced during combustion of fossil fuels in the gas turbines when generating electricity.  The SCR process introduces aqueous ammonia into the exhaust gas stream and then passes the mixture through a catalyst bed.  The resultant chemical reaction generates nitrogen gas and water as the reduced end products, which in turn are released to the atmosphere via the plant's exhaust stack.\n\n\n\nCBE stores the aqueous ammonia on site as a 29.5 percent solution in a 21,282-gallon tank, which is administratively limited to 13,000 gal.  The quantity of aqueous ammonia stored exceeds the EPA regulated threshold quantity for accidental release prevention.  Therefore, CBE "

The RMP must include an analysis of potential off-site consequences of a regulated substance accidental release, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.  Covered facilities also must submit to the EPA a summary of their risk management program, which also will be made available to other federal, state, and government agencies as well as the public.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0  Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nAs required, CBE performed an off-site consequence analysis that included a worst-case and alternative accident scenario of its regulated substance, aqueous ammonia.  The worst-case scenario is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance (regardless of its likelihood) that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The endpoint is a numerical concentration chosen by EPA beyond which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed without any serious health effects.  The alternative scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches off site.\n\n\n\nCBE performed a number of different accident analyses to determine which ones present the greatest distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is the radius of a circular area that might be affected in the event of an accidental chemical release.  The accident analyses followed the steps detailed in the EPA guidance document \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-Site Consequence Analysis,\" March 2009.  The endpoint distances were calculated using EPA's software utility program RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo ensure a hazardous chemical release does not occ"

      "SummaryText": "ur, CBE has implemented a multi-element prevention program.  The program elements are designed to meet EPA's Risk Management Program requirements and include the use of:\n\n\n\n- Operator attendance at truck loading and unloading operations;\n\n- Secondary containment around tanks;\n\n- Process safety information to document the safe process design;\n\n- Process hazard reviews to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n\n- Operating procedures to ensure that the systems are operated safely;\n\n- Maintenance to ensure that the systems meet applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\n\n- Training to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\n\n- Incident investigation procedures to examine each incident and \"near misses\" to determine the root cause and make needed safety improvements; and\n\n- Periodic compliance audits.\n\n\n\nCBE believes that these elements provide a well-established, integrated approach to ensure that the storage of aqueous ammonia will have a substantial margin of safety to protect both the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nIn the past 5 years, CBE has not had any incident or \"near misses\" that resulted in any release of hazardous chemicals (aqueous ammonia).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the CBE has developed an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is designed to minimize the hazards to the public or the environment from fires, explosions, natural disasters, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of chemicals to air, soil, or surface water.  The provisions of the plan include procedures for internal and external notifications, preliminary emergency assessment, mitigating actions, and mobilization of resources.  Additionally, the ICP describes personnel training, conduct, and frequency of drills or exercises, and coordination with local responders.\n\n\n\nIf a "

Local emergency management agencies would notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection.\n\n\n\n6.0  Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nCBE has completed several improvements to the aqueous ammonia system to improve the safety of the system to prevent an accidental release.  The improvements include:\n\n\n\n- Installation of Process Area Ammonia Sensors\n\n- Replacement of the Steel Ammonia System piping with Stainless Steel Piping\n\n- Installation of new Ammonia Control Valve Positioners for improved maintenance and diagnostics\n\n- Enclosed the area around the Ammonia Forwarding Pumps for better pump operation during cold weather conditions"
