To help us achieve a workplace that is safe and free from hazards (i.e., chemical releases), we have developed different safety programs and policies. This QTF Foods processing plant uses ammonia as a refrigerant, which is considered hazardous by OSHA and the EPA. Because of the hazardous properties associated with ammonia it is necessary to observe the many safety precautions in the handling of ammonia in our processes. It is QTF's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations while using the best management practices as established by the Industrial Institute Of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). Safe handling of ammonia is the result of safety features built into the system, along with training and safe handling procedures observed by our refrigeration personnel.\n     The QTF Foods' emergency response to an accidental chemical release is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action & response planning. We have contracted with an outside agency, certified in hazardous material response who will be contacted in the event of a release.\n\nDescription of the facility & the regulated substance handled.\n\nThe Quik-To-Fix Foods, Garland Plant, is part of an independent, value-added meat company with a long and successful history of supplying products to food service operators through a national distribution system. The regulated substance used at our facility is ammonia. Ammonia, due to its environmental friendliness, economic and energy efficiencies is used within a closed system as a refrigerant for temperature control and product freezing. Access to our processes is restricted to authorized management personnel, plant employees and contrac"

      "SummaryText": "tors. \n\nWorst Case Scenario.\n\n     Failure to our largest storage vessel when filled to its greatest capacity would result in the release of 8,300 lbs. of ammonia. The amount of ammonia released from the storage vessel, enclosed in a ventilated room, would be in liquid form which would vaporize into the surrounding atmosphere. Ammonia has a strong, pungent odor and is colorless in a gas and liquid stage. Ammonia is not considered flammable, but upon reaching a determined level of concentration within an enclosed space can be explosive.\nThe distance to endpoint under the worst case conditions, ammonia could travel  0.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer posing a hazard to the public. This was determined using RMP*Comp32 downloaded from the EPA.Gov webpage.\n\nAlternate Case Scenario.\n\n     Due to possible oversized pressurization within the ammonia system, a relief valve system is used and designed to release any pressure build up to the atmosphere. This system prevents an over pressure situation which may cause vessel or pope failure. Ammonia released through the relief valve system would be on vapor form. Relief valves are designed to close when the over pressurization situation is controlled, which can be done manually. The distance to endpoint for the alternative scenario is calculated at 0.2 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. This was determined using RMP*Comp32 downloaded from the EPA.Gov webpage.\n  \nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n     The ammonia system within the Garland Plant is in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management Program. IIRA guidelines are implemented in the processes. Key to the prevention program is our emergency cut off switches. Operating procedures have been established maintain a consistent and safe system. The engine room is equipped with an ammonia detection system to alert the personnel of any im"

      "SummaryText": "posing danger.\n\nFive Year History.\n\n     No release noted in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program.\n\n     The QTF Foods, Garland Plant has a written emergency response plan outlining roles and responsibilities plant personnel are to follow in the event of a release.  Emergency response includes notification of our outside Hazardous Materials Response Team.  This is a team of individuals trained for containment and isolation during an ammonia release.  This team works closely with and has conducted joint training and drills with the local fire department and emergency planning coordinator.  Efforts to alert affected community members is coordinated through refrigeration and safety personnel, and these local agencies.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nAt present our ammonia system is manually operated.  Refrigeration personnel are continually learning new system controls and design improvements through training and outside agencies such as our ammonia contractor and IIAR.  The system is continually being updated to ensure continued process control."
