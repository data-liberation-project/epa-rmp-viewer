The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training.  \nIn Brooklyn Bedding\u2019s Emergency Response policy, employees who have been trained as Hazmat Team/First Responders will respond.  For all other releases Brooklyn Bedding will rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department, off-site emergency response contractor to support the efforts of the in-house Hazmat Team). \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nBrooklyn Bedding, under the RMP program, as well as the EPCRA Tier II reporting programs, has organized its management system to effectively address all hazards and potential risks.  Both the advanced planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, emergency prepared-ness, and the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices and ongoing personnel training are necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  These programs are all documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is continuously available to employees and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Site Emergency Coordinator when questions arise from public safety officials on potential risks to the community.  These features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at this site lead to operations that are safe today but will be even safer tomorrow."
