Public and employee safety, as well as environmental protection, are primary issues of concern to Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI).  Accidental release prevention is a key factor in the design, construction and operation of all KMI facilities.  KMI facilities are constructed in accordance with applicable codes/ standards and are evaluated to ensure that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  KMI facilities are equipped with many engineering safeguards (i.e.:  pressure relief valves, shutdowns, alarms, etc.) that are designed to prevent situations that would require an emergency response. \n\n\n\nThis facility maintains a written emergency plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The Emergency Plan is provided to assist personnel who react to and respond to plant emergencies. It contains information relating to recognition and reporting of emergencies, minimizing hazards, and actions that must be taken to protect personnel, property and gas service. The objective of the Emergency Plan is to assure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency are adequately trained to recognize and deal with emergency situations in an expeditious and safe manner.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel are trained to take defensive or incipient firefighting actions. Local fire departments will be responsible for extinguishing fires that have gone beyond the incipient stage. Therefore, this plan is limited to providing guidance for our employees to evacuate the facility and notify the appropriate authorities.\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary, to perform their specific emergency plan duties. The emergency plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other facilities. The emergency plan changes are administered throu"

This plan is provided to applicable outside agencies that might be called upon for assistance in an emergency situation (i.e.:  police department, fire department, etc.).\n\n\n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances.  The Watford City Gas Plant is a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 68.3.  The regulated substances at the facility are flammable chemical mixtures of either Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), propane, butane, or natural gasoline.  These mixtures are combinations of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, including various proportions of chemicals such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutene, pentane, and isopentane.    As flammable mixtures, these chemicals have an RMP regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The facility has aboveground storage tank processes for NGLs, propane, butane, and natural gasoline which exceed the 10,000lb threshold.\n\n\n\n(c)    Worst-Case Release Scenario and Administrative/Mitigative Controls.  In accordance with 40CFR 68.25, 68.167 and EPA guidance, one worst-case release scenario (WCRS) and offsite consequences analysis (OCA) was prepared for each Program 1 process.  Alternate release scenarios were not required.  These WCRSs assumed the rupture of the largest NGL, propane, butane, or natural gasoline product storage tank.  Such a release has the potential of the formation of a vapor cloud that could explode when exposed to an ignition source.  Using the EPA's RMPComp software, the WCRSs distances/endpoints were calculated to be 0.6 miles from the NGL, butane, and propane tank processes and 0.3 miles for the natural gasoline storage process.  Based on this calculation, and a visual examination of the latest available overhead photography from Google Earth, it was determined that no public receptors were within the WCRS for any process.  Various administrative and mitigative (engineering) controls h"

Administrative controls include utilizing a well-trained operation and maintenance staff that periodically visit and inspect the facility processes.  Mitigative controls include as high pressure / overpressure relief valves, high-pressure shutdowns, high temperature shutdowns, high level shutdowns, etc. \n\n\n\n(d)    Hazard Communication Program.  KMI has developed and implemented a Company Hazard Communication Program that ensures:  1) an SDS is on file for all hazardous chemicals used or stored in the facility; 2) all applicable containers of hazardous chemicals are properly labeled / marked; and 3) employees receive annual training on the Company's Hazard Communication Program.\n\n\n\n(e)    Five Year Accident History.  The Watford City Gas has not had a regulated flammable chemical release in the previous five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  We are committed to operating this facility in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment. Our personnel utilize auditing processes to ensure that this facility complies with safe operations of its processes. Improvements to safety are a continual process at the plant and safety policy and procedure modifications are constantly evolving. Specific changes to control equipment or technology and installation of new mitigation systems are not in progress at this time.\n\n"
