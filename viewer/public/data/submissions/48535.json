The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of ice cream products within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a receiver vessel, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Creamland Dairies, Inc. is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nAs a part of its PSM Program, Creamland Dairies, Inc. has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. These programs include:\n\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\n\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Review\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigations\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permits\n\u00bf\tContractor Safety\n\n\nEmergency Response Information:\nAs a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was"

      "SummaryText": "prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 which will notify the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County LEPC, and the Albuquerque Police and Fire Departments. In addition, the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County LEPC has included Creamland Dairies, Inc. in its local emergency and community planning efforts.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nCreamland Dairies, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n\nSteps to Improve Safety: \nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Emergency Response Plans, ammonia detection systems. local protective alarm systems and continued OSHA training and audits are some of the major steps taken to improve safety at our facility. \n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
