The Pier Property covers over 152 Acres and Trident's Facility is located almost exactly in the middle of the Pier's property; and covers over 168,000 square feet on the ground level. Fortunately the central location gives the Trident Facility a fairly large buffer area to the North, East and West, and directly to the south is another Cold Storage that also uses ammonia as a refrigerant. This central location with buffer zones helps mitigate some of our exposure the residential areas that surround the pier property.\r\n\r\nTrident Seafoods Corporate and Management Staff are continually committed to the Health and Safety of its employees, surrounding communities and the environment. The Trident Pier 91 Facility's Managers and employees are as equally committed to these same safety and health values.  We have built and implemented a very compete and well established safety plan and policy. Our preparation of the PSM and RMP Plans are further evidence of our commitment to the safety and health of the employees, community and environment.\r\n\r\nThe Trident Seafoods Pier-91 Seattle facility has on the premises a large refrigeration system that uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant; with a total volume above the reportable threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \r\nIt employs this refrigeration system to freeze and store seafood and various other food products. The quantity of ammonia contained in the system at this facility does require Trident Seafoods to comply with an OSHA\\WISHA Process Safety Management Program as well as the EPA Level 3 Risk Management Program. These programs are designed to assure the health and safety of all on-site employees, as well as all offsite persons and environmental receptors. \r\n\r\nThe Trident Pier-91 Facility utilizes a large common refrigeration system"

This facility has two distinct business units; one half of the plant is a large Cold Storage and Distribution facility, the other half is a Food Processing facility. The common refrigeration system has capabilities to provide three different temperature ranges in the plant. The smallest portion of the of the refrigeration load is to maintain + 40\u00baF to +50\u00baF refrigeration for plant processing water, air conditioning and loading dock temperature control. The second largest refrigeration load operates at -20\u00baF for our large Cold Stores and a smaller holding freezer. The last and largest portion of the refrigeration load is for the -45\u00baF Processing (blast) freezers.  \r\n\r\nThe facility refrigeration system was engineered and designed to current industry standards and regulations and has been certified by a P.E.. The refrigeration system uses industry standard materials, components, and follows the IIAR and Refrigeration industry guidelines which provide for overlapping layers of safety and protection of the refrigeration system and components. These overlapping layers of protection are provided through the use of automatic and manual controls which minimize the operating deviations and maintain the system within the safe operational parameters. In the most critical operations, there are also redundant back-up systems.\r\n\r\nAlong with the inherent sound engineering and design that was originally built into the system, Trident Seafoods has taken a very pro-active approach to all aspects of safety, especially our approach to chemical safety as it pertains to ammonia. We have done extensive training for every employee on site as to the Hazards involved with ammonia and other chemicals, and we conduct mock evacuation drills regular basis to expose and train all employees of their roles and requirements should an emergency arise.\r\n\r\nThrough the long process of developing these safety programs and procedures, Trident Seafoods ha"

All aspects of our general plant safety program, procedures and policies comply with the latest WISHA Standards. The Facility is currently in the process of attempting to obtain OSHA's VPP status. The PSM Program was written to the OSHA and WISHA Guidelines and the system design also complies with the ASHRE and ANSI Standards. The ammonia Piping System is labeled and marked and tagged in accordance with OSHA recommendations in following the IIAR best practices. The P&ID is current and there is a block flow diagram in place.  SOP's are used for all refrigeration tasks and PPE is mandated for all SOPs.
