It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Vallisca Volunteer Fire Department via 911 call, and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification of the fire department, a call to the local LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (ie anhydrous ammonia) tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.  \n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Vallisca, Iowa location is Daivd Lindburg, Manager.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of one (1) 12,000 gallon storage tank with associated puping, valves, liquid pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting in the release of the total volume of contents in a gaseous form.  According to EPA's RMP Comp Program (Version 1.06) the distance to the endpoint is 3.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves th etransport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.  \n\nThe system is protected from major releases by a series of valves and breakaway couplers, all designed to stop the contents flow in th eevent of a break.  When not in use, the storage tank valves are locked.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the town of Villisca, Iowa, provisions have been designed to notify all affetced persons.  An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 with amendments and State Law.\n\nIn addition, the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental and potenti"

Finally, Villisca Elevator, Inc. has extended to the Villisca Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information provided by the company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nVillisca Elevator Inc, Villisca, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Villisa Elevator Inc. to immediately notify the Villisca Volunteer Fire Department and the LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency.  In the unlikely event that the Villisca fire department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Villisca location, alternative arrangements for emergency response have been made and discussed with the Villisca Fire Department and the LEPC.  Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant.  In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided for reference to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to ann"
