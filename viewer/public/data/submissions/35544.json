(OMI).\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nOMI believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment. Accordingly, OMI has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which  rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support. This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Quigg Branch WPCP RMP for the chlorine system. OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the  chlorine storage and chlorination processes at the Quigg Branch WPCP and therefore, has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements. By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule. Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine, a regulated chemical under the RMP regulation. If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur. Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nOMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with chlorine at the Quigg Branch WPCP"

The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of the chlorine storage and the chlorination system. Refresher training is provided to the employees at least once every three years. They are aided in this work by complete and understandable system operating procedures. \n\nOMI management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Quigg Branch WPCP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for the emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and updated as changes in staffing occur.\n\n2.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Quigg Branch WPCP owned by the Rockdale County is located in Conyers, Georgia.  The 6 MGD Quigg Branch WPCP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations. Incoming wastewater initially passes through automated bar screens before being treated in a three-channel orbital activated sludge basin. Clarification is accomplished in biological clarifiers with the option of flowing to chemical clarifiers for final solids precipitation. Final effluent is disinfected by chlorination prior to discharge to the Yellow River. Solids are digested aerobically and de-watered on an Ashbrook gravity belt and Ashbrook belt filter press prior to landfilling. \n\nThe Quigg Branch WPCP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six to eight containers (12,000 to 16,000 pounds) on site. Therefore, the Quigg Branch"

The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n3.1 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n3.2 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. PHA was revalidated in June 2004.\n\n3.3  Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures were reviewed in December 2003.\n\n3.4 Training for each Quigg Branch WPCP employee involved in operating the chlorine system. \n\n3.5 Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment.\n\n3.6 Management of change procedures to manage changes (other than \"replacements in kind\") to the chlorine system. The Management of Change procedures were reviewed in June 2004.\n\n3.7 Pre-startup safety review for additions or significant modifications to the chlorine process, or any new regulated chemical process.\n\n3.8 Compliance audits at least every three years from 1999 to evaluate Quigg Branch WPCP RMP compliance.

The Hot Work Procedures were reviewed in June 2004.\n\n3.12 Contractor management program, to ensure appropriate evaluation and selection of qualified contractors for work on or near the chlorine system, proper notification of contractors regarding known chlorine system hazards and the Quigg Branch WPCP emergency evacuation plan, limited access to the chlorine process, and evaluation of contractor performance.\n\nIn addition to these elements, the chlorine storage area at the Quigg Branch WPCP is equipped with a chlorine leak detector that continuously monitors the air for chlorine gas. If the chlorine sensor detects a specified level of chlorine, audio and visual alarms will be activated and a high rate ventilation system can be activated. The ventilation system withdraws chlorine and air from a low elevation in the chlorine storage room to a safe outdoor location. The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a chlorine release.

The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chlorine release and to minimize the effects of such releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes. \n\n6.0  Planned changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee participation meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Quigg Branch WPCP. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of such hazards.\n \nAs part of the development of the Quigg Branch WPCP program, PHA were revalidated with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements. As the equipment and the process has remained the same from the time the first PHA was performed in 1999, the PHA review/revalidation conducted in June 2004 did not result in any new findings or recommendations. The recommendations from the PHA conducted in 1999 and the findings of the compliance audit conducted in May 2002 were reviewed for completion; a few recommendations are scheduled to be completed in July 2004."
