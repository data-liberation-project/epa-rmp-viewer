THE FACILITY POLICY\n                              The owners, management, and the employees of the Danville Cooperative Association are \n                  committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental \n                  release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \n                  authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people\n                  and the environment.\n\n\n               2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n                               The primary activity at the facility is the storing of fertilizer for sale to the farmers.\n\n                               Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for\n                        crop production nutrients.\n\n                                The maximum quantity stored would be 136,000 pounds in our tanks with the capacity\n                        one of 13,000 gallons and one of 18,000 gallons. The maximum quantity handled would be \n                        the unloadiing of a semi trailer holding 43,000 pounds.\n\n               3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n                                 A.The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\n                         released as a gas over the period of ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be\n                         80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent \n                         capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point would be  (point of \n                         dispersion to 200 ppm) 1.89 miles.\n\n                                 B.
