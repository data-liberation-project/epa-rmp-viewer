In Addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable fereral, state and local laws.\n\nTrico's Corporate Mission states \"To Provide for the saftey of our employees, our customers, and general \npublic\". In order to fufill this mission, Terra provides EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive saftey and enviromental programs and procedures. EHS field saftey services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with saftey standards of the company.\n\nThis Facility maintains approximatley 28  1,000-Gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is  130,760 Pounds.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in One 18,000 gallon storage tank on site. 84,100 Pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of our stationary storage tank. Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capicty for our facility is 214,900 pounds. The largest single storage facility contains 84,100 pounds.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO.\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quanity released would be 84,000 pounds. According to DEGIDUS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. It Should be noted that The Ag Industry has never had a release of an entire stationary tank.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe Most Common alternative release scenario From our facility would not reach an end-point off site. The Alternative release scenario modled for the purposes of this plan is a 2 minute release from a stationary storag"

It should be noted Trico Farm Supplies has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELESE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThe ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This Facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidential Prevention Rule  as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by intenal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut offs and emergency shutoff valves.The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediatly stop the flow of ammonia in a line or a hose fails. All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventitive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards\n\nOur location has a 'Site Saftey Coordinator' as an extention of the EHS group. These coordinators are givin training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory recordkeeping, conduct reqular saftey meetings, conduct employee training and act as the location's contcat with the EHS group. The site saftey coordinators act as the location emergency contact.\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply"

The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a sorce of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops\n.\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annualy, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever compentancy with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or enviromental damage including evacuations on or off-site\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system. It is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preperation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information to ensure that our community has a stratigy for the responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPRCA and Coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn Addition Trico Farm Supplies has an emergency Response Contingency Plan for our facility that complies with the requirements of OHSA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200) Comunity right to know.
