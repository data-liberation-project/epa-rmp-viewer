The Facility has implemented reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances. If a release does occur, the Facility?s personnel are trained to take steps to control and contain the release until local emergency response organizations arrive. \n\n\n\nThe Facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams. Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program. In addition, the Facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job]). Because processes at the Facility regulated by EPA's RMP regulation are also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM standard, OSHA PSM elements and the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program for each of the elements are discussed in the following sections of this RMP. \n\n",

The legal description for the Facility is Section 14, Township 8 North, Range 6 West. The Amber Gas Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of plant personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility). The Facility's approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances. If release does occur, the Facility's trained personnel will take steps to control and contain the release until emergency response organizations arrive.\n\n\n\nThis RMP will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and other matters addressed in the federal requirements regulating risk management of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThis document reflects the conditions at the Amber Gas Plant as they exist during the time of the RMP preparation. The offsite consequence analysis (OCA) has been developed using the current population determined by LANDVIEW 6, Census 2000 population estimator. The OCA determines the Facility's Risk Management Program facility status based on the criteria in 40 CFR Part 68, the federal requirements regulating risk management of highly hazardous chemicals.  Section 112(r) of the amended Clean Air Act (CAA), signed into law on November 15, 1990, mandates a federal focus on the prevention of chemical accidents.  The objective of Section 112(r) is to prevent serious chemical accidents that ha"

Under these requirements, industry has the obligation to prevent accidents, operate safely, and manage hazardous chemicals in a safe and responsible way. \n\n\n\nThe risk management planning requirements of the CAA Section 112(r) complement and support the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA).  EPCRA helps local communities prepare for and respond to chemical accidents.  It also requires communities to develop emergency response plans, based on information from industry concerning hazardous chemicals.  Under the CAA 112(r) requirements, stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and carry out certain activities designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases.  \n\n\n\nThe OCA is a component of the CAA Section 112(r) and includes an evaluation of the regulated chemicals to be stored at the Facility and the simulation of a worst-case and an alternate case release of those chemicals.  The simulation is conducted to determine if the Facility will have off-site consequences affecting any surrounding public receptors.  \n\n\n\nThe OCA and RMP will help prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases by stating policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal regulations for risk management of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers, the public, and the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting f"

In addition, the Facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Facility's processes. The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Facility is coordinated with the Grady County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), City of Amber Fire Department, Grady County Sheriff's Department, and the state highway patrol. These organizations are responsible (if necessary) for notifying the public, coordinating the community response (e.g., blocking off roads, evacuation), and providing onsite response (e.g., firefighting, medical treatment). The Facility conducts periodic emergency action drills and provides periodic refreshers to the local emergency response organizations on the hazards associated with the plant operations.\n\n"
