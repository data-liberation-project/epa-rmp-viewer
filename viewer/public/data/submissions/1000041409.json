This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Systems.  Goal Line LP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\n\n\nThe Goal Line LP is located at 555 Tulip Street, Escondido, California 92025.  \n\nThe regulated substances at the Facility are: anhydrous ammonia for the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Unit and 30% aqueous ammonia for both the SCR Ammonia System and the Ammonia Absorption System.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nProcess No.1: SCR Ammonia System - 30% Aqueous Ammonia\n\n\n\n?

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2014 Five Year Update Binder.\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Goal Line LP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release, including the following:\n\n\n\n?Although, the facility is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM, the facility prevention program meets and exceeds the PSM requirements.\n\n?Ammonia sensors are located in the process area.\n\n?Automatic/Manual shutdowns in place.\n\n?Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n\n?The history of the Goal Line LP facility (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Unit and SCR System.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe facility h"

(all concentrations) state threshold for CalARP Program.  Goal Line LP is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirements due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the facility is 30% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%.  For the reasons mentioned above, the SCR Ammonia System is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and US EPA RMP Program Level 2.\n\n\n\nThe Absorption Refrigeration Unit has an inventory of 5,160 lbs. anhydrous ammonia on-site.  The regulated substance is over the 500-lb. threshold for the CalARP Program but under the US EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM Program threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Therefore, the Absorption Refrigeration Unit is only subject to CalARP Program Level 2.\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, even though the Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Unit and the Ammonia SCR System are only subject to Prevention Program 2 requirements, Prevention Program 3 elements were implemented by Goal Line LP to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for the NOx abatement, as well as for the refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?Process Safety Information\n\n?Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?Operating Procedures\n\n?Training\n\n?Mechanical Integrity\n\n?Management of Change\n\n?Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?Compliance Audits\n\n?Incident Investigation\n\n?Employee Participation\n\n?Hot Work Permit\n\n?Contractors\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in Section 4.7 of this document. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nNew accident history information - For any accidental releas"
