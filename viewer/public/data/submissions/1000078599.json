For the different process areas, the chemical complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chemical complex also maintains an electronic database, that is accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe LCCC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations and the What-if/Checklist method for Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the process unit fo"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers' work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n\n?    Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n?    Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n\n?    Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\n\n\nAll new employees assigned as operators receive comprehensive training before being assigned to a specific operating unit.

The plant has an Emergency Response Team that is available 24 hours per day, and trained to respond and take actions to contain, control, and mitigate any release that might occur. The team has access to on-site emergency equipment which is appropriate for situations that could possibly occur at the LCCC including dedicated firewater supply/distribution, firefighting systems and appliances, and multiple pieces of apparatus for firefighting, medical, rescue, and hazardous material / spill response. \n\nIn addition to the considerable on-site resources, the LCCC is a member of the Southwest Louisiana Mutual Aid Association. This membership allows the LCCC (if needed) to draw on the emergency response resources of other industries and municipalities locally and regionally.  Th"
