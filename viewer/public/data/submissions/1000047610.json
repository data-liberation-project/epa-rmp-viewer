      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nBasin Electric Power Cooperative (BEPC), Lonesome Creek Station (LCS) is a natural gas-fired peaking station located northwest of Williston, North Dakota. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction process. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two interconnected tanks, each containing a maximum of 8,500 lbs of ammonia. Since LCS has more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, it is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  The facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for anhydrous ammonia. \r\nManagement System\r\nThe BEPC LCS RMP Program is led by an RMP Management Team dedicated to the establishment of management systems that successfully implement the various elements of the Program. BEPC has also established written procedures to ensure that the safety of employees, the public, and the environment is maintained during plant operations and when changes are implemented. \r\nPrevention Program\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nAll employees affected or potentially affected by the ammonia process are aware of the RMP Program implemented in the facility.  Those employees directly involved with operation and maintenance of the ammonia system are intimately involved with the development and execution of the program and have input as procedures and policies are established.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe facility maintains accurate and current process safety information covering the hazards, technology and equipment in the ammonia process. \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nAnother important aspect of the prevention program is the assessment of the hazards associated with the process. BEPC follows a program for systematically identifying and evaluating potential hazards associated with the operation of the ammonia process. This includes the regular conduct of Process Hazard Analyses to analyze the hazards of the process, specific process conditions and controls, pot"

The operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work with or maintain the ammonia process. These procedures are reviewed at least annually to ensure they are current and accurate.  In addition, through the Management-of-Change program, the operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to confirm that they reflect current operating practice, and changes in process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\nBEPC trains, and periodically retrains through refresher training, employees involved in operating the ammonia process concerning the hazards of the process and the routine and non-routine tasks required to safely perform their jobs.\r\nContractors\r\nBEPC has implemented a contractor safety program that includes procedures to hire and use contractors who will perform their work without compromising the safety and health of facility or contractor employees. This program helps ensure that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the LCS ammonia process.  This awareness should lead to reduced risks for accidents, thus improved safety for both contractor employees, BEPC employees, and the public.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe ammonia system has been designed, constructed, and installed using good engineering practices and conforms to industry standards. BEPC's Mechanical Integrity program assures that the system is also maintained to minimize the risk of accidental ammonia release. \r\nHot Work Permit \r\nAn established hot work permit procedure for fire prevention is in place to ensure all safety precautions are taken before any hot work is started in a non-designated hot work area.\r\nManagement of Change and Pre-startup Review \r\nThe facility has developed a management of change an"

The purpose of this program is to ensure that changes to the equipment and processes are justified and have Operations, Maintenance, and Engineering Department's concurrence, with appropriate management approval. The program covers changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, structures, operational procedures, changes in key staff, and training. \r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe BEPC Incident Investigation program is used to investigate incidents and near misses in order to determine the root cause(s) so that corrective actions can be implemented, thereby preventing similar incidents or accidents from occurring in the future.  \r\nCompliance Audits\r\nBEPC has a program established to self-evaluate the effectiveness of the RMP Program by identifying deficiencies and ensuring corrective actions for on-going program improvement.\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe BEPC LCS facility has not had any RMP reportable accidents. BEPC is confident that the policies and programs in place at the facility will help maintain this record in the years ahead.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nBEPC LCS maintains an Emergency Action Plan that details procedures for how to handle emergency situations quickly and effectively with minimum hazard to the employees involved.  After employee safety, the procedures are in place to minimize damage to equipment, minimize interruption of operations, and coordinate outside assistance. BEPC LCS is also included in the community emergency response plan and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAs a new facility, BEPC LCS is committed to ensuring all the RMP Program elements are properly and timely implemented.  The facility will ensure that the employees are fully trained in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia process, emergency response, chemical and equipment"
