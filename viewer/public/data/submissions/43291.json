This facility observes safety precautionsin handling ammonia to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the enviroment, and adheres to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which the facility handles ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of the personnel.Emergency response for the facility is coordinated with the Page Fire Department. This includes procedures for notifying the fire department in the event of an accident involving ammonia.\nB: The Sationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\nThe regulated substance at this facility is ammonia. Ammonia is stored for retail sale to farmers as fertilizer. Ammonia is received by truck and stored in two storage tanks.\nC: Off-Site Consequence Analysis\nWorst Case Scenario: As a worst case scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of the large storage tank would release it's contents over a ten minute period.\nAlternative Scenario: A more realistic release scenario involving ammonia would be a slow vapor release from a 1/4 inch hole resulting from a piping failure at a flange, joint, weld, or seal.\nD: Accidental Release Prevention\nThe key concepts in this facilities prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design, maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of employees.\nE: Five Year Accident History\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving ammonia that require reporting under the EPA's Risk Management Rule.\nF: Emergency Response Program\nEmergency response at this facililty is coordinated with the Page Fire Department, such that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.\nG: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAs a result of a safety revie"
