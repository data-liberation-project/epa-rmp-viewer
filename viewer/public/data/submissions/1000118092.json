      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary-Geneva, NE. Terminal\nI.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response \nSunoco is committed to the safety of our employees, surrounding community, and the environment and the Geneva, NE. Terminal achieved OSHA VPP Star status on December 15, 2014, and recertified on December 11, 2017, and again on November 28, 2022. It is Sunoco\u0092s policy to comply with all federal, state, and local laws as well as accepted industry practice for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, butane, propane and other liquefied petroleum gases. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nII.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances. The Geneva Terminal was built and put into service in 1953. The facility was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 10\u0094 pipeline and a 16\u0094 pipeline, to the Geneva Terminal from the Sunoco Terminal in Concordia, Kansas. The 1,492,974 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of sixteen, pressurized \u0093bullet\u0094 tanks. The LM is stored in two pressurized \u0093bullet\u0094 tanks. The propane is removed from the site by either propane trucks that deliver it to various customers, or by one of four pipelines, which consist of two 8\u0094 pipelines and two 6\u0094 pipelines.\n\nIII.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps. The Sunoco Geneva, NE. Terminal will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements. \n\u0095\tTraining: Employees are trained in the safe handling of all products stored at the facility and are trained in appropriate emergency actions required tin response to a potentia"

Employees are trained and must demonstrate an understanding of the required task before being allowed to handle any RMP regulated substances. \n\u0095\tSafety Equipment: Describe the safety system around the regulated substance. \n\u0095\tFacility Design: The anhydrous ammonia, butane, propane handling facility has been designed to meet the standards set forth in NFPA 58 and is operated in compliance with the OSHA standard for the storage and handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (29 CFR 1910.110) \nIV.\tFive-year Accident History \nThe Sunoco Geneva, NE. Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. There has been no accidental release of a regulated substance, meeting the RMP five-year accident history reporting criteria, in the past five years. \nV.\tEmergency Response Information\nThe Sunoco Geneva, NE. Terminal has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on factors such as modifications made to the process or changes in the communication procedures. \nVI.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nThe Sunoco Geneva, NE. Terminal will continue to improve employee training resources, conduct safety audits, and incident investigations, as applicable, to continuously improve worker and public safety. The terminal will also continue to actively manage changes to facilities, process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment, as well as to review and revise operating, maintenance, emergency, and communication procedures to ensure that they reflect current operating practices.
