The Carbon Dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into liquid form and the liquid Carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid.  The facility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid Carbon Dioxide (dry ice). Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in a closed loop Ammonia refrigeration system located on the facility. An ammonia receiver stores the Ammonia refrigerant  in addition to various heat exchangers, compressors, condensers and connecting piping and valves.\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario for ammonia system is a failure of the 2 ammonia receivers resulting in the release of ammonia.The quantity of the release is estimated to be 27,450lb of ammonia over a 10 minute period of time with most stable of atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a release and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to atmospheric conditions. The calculated toxic endpoint of which the concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 1.5 miles.  These calculations were based on the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public receptors identified within 1.4 miles of the facility include residences, schools and commercial/industrial areas. There is an estimated population of 7,237 that could be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nAn alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA guidelines. A leak from a pipe, pump or vessel was assumed to create a release rate of 200lb per minute.  The atmospheric condition are assumed to be more typical of the area and the toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 580ft (0.1 miles).  Again, calculations were based on the\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Guidelines fro Ammonia Refrigeration.\" Public receptors within 0.1 miles of the facility include residences and commercial"

If necessary, the Clearfield Fire Department  will be contacted and emergency response procedures  will be coordinated with the Clearfield Fire Department and the Clearfield County LEPC and any other local authorities in order to most effectively  protect our employees, our property and our community.\n\n\n\nThis facility has received an additional CO2 recovery System in Sept of 2021. The additional System required an additional 15,000#'S of Anhydrous Ammonia being added to the system. A new RMP is being submitted to reflect the change in the amount of Chemicals of Interest on-site.\n\n"
