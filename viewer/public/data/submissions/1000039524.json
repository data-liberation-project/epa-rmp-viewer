Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Browns Valley Community Elevator in Browns Valley, Minnesota  are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Browns Valley Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 12,000-gallon tank, and twenty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Browns Valley, Minnesota.  The maximum amount stored  at  85% standard maximum storage capacity is 27,200 gallons (139,971.2 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 52,489.2 pounds at  85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n3.
