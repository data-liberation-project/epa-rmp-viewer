The maximum on site vessel size is   30,000    Gallons, storing   130,000   Lbs.  The\nmaximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank\nholding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and\nreloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour\nrequirement to qualify as a full time employee on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  \nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night throughout\nthe year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest\nAnhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released would be    130,000   Lbs.  based on \n85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is   4.0     miles based on EPA's RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06).  Possible public\nand environmental receptors within the area has been provided to the County LEPC (Local\nEmergency Planning Committee) for their consideration.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We\nbelieve the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are\nprotected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and pull away valves so our alternative release\nscenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation\nequipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is (Urban) 0.06  miles\n(317 feet) rounded to 0.1 mile (528 feet) per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nAccidenta"

In the event an\naccidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company(s), \nEmergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on\nthe specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people\nand the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, establishments primarily engaged in\noperating country or terminal grain elevators, however we are also engaged in providing\nagricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for\ndelivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and\nreloading Anhydrous Ammonia is # 493130 farm product warehousing and storage.  Although\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it\nshould be noted that we also handle Propane for both agricultural uses and home heating, which is\nunder consideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectents and\npetroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the\nAnhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during\nthe early and fall months.
