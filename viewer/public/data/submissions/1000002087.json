To achieve this end, Venoco strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nVenoco implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environmental are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n1.2 Facility Description\n\nThe Ellwood Onshore Facility is located west of Goleta in the southeast corner of Santa Barbara County, about 1,200 feet from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 2 miles south of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The elevation of the Treatment Plant site is about 20 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake faults are the Mesa-Rincon Creek Fault Zone, approximately 9 miles to the west and the More Ranch-Mission Ridge-Arroyo Parida Fault Zone, approximately \u00c2\u00bd-mile to the south.  Other local faults include the Santa Ynez Fault and the Los Alamos-Baseline Fault Zone. The approximate coordinates of the plant are longitude 119\u00c2\u00b0 54\u00c2\u00bf 42\u00c2\u00bf west and latitude 34\u00c2\u00b0 25\u00c2\u00bf 52\u00c2\u00bf north (coordinates were determined from the EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program that can be found at the link below).\n\nhttp://www.epa.gov/tri/report/siting_tool/index.htm\n \nThe facility address is 7979 Hollister Avenue, Goleta.

The nearest major highway is U.S. Route 101, approximately 0.1 miles to the north.  The Southern-Pacific Railroad parallels U.S. Route 101.  \n\nA small residential area is located above Highway 101, about 0.35 miles northeast of the plant.  The Sandpiper Golf Course is adjacent to the site on the east, about 0.1 miles from the site boundary.  Bacara Park and Haskell\u00c2\u00bfs Beach are about 0.3-0.35 miles to the west of the facility.   These are considered public receptors under the RMP regulation.\n\nThe process includes a gas separation plant, emulsion separation unit and vapor recovery unit.  The facility currently produces about 3,500 barrels per day of crude oil, 5 million cubic feet per day of sales gas, and 12,000 gallons per day of natural gas liquids (NGL) and mixed liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  Sour field gas from the Holly offshore platform is chilled (using a propane refrigerant) to remove NGLs. Next, a glycol dehydration unit removes excess moisture from the gas and a gas-sweetening (LO-CAT) unit removes H2S from the gas prior to low temperature separation of LPG from the sales gas. Excess carbon dioxide in the sales gas is removed in a Grace membrane unit and the separated gas is used as fuel gas. The emulsion from the offshore platform is heated to remove produced water, which is disposed in an injection well. The separated crude oil is stripped to remove hydrogen sulfide and then sent via pipeline to the marine terminal. A vapor recovery unit is used to compress hydrogen sulfide vapors stripped from the crude oil, which are then sweetened in the LO-CAT unit. \n1.3 Covered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ellwood facility handles the following regulated substances per RMP paragraph 68.130, Table 1:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMethane\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEthane\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPropane\n\u00c2\u00bf\tButane\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPentane\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHydrog"

A \u00c2\u00bfstationary source\u00c2\u00bf is defined in paragraph 68.3. A key definition of a stationary source is that the process belongs to the same industrial group (i.e., SIC code). This is further defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.2 of the General Guidance for RMP document as \u00c2\u00bfoperations at a site that belong to the same three-digit NAICS code prefix\u00c2\u00bf.  All operations at Ellwood would fall under the three-digit NAICS code prefix of 211, Oil and Gas Extraction. \n\nThe liquid crude oil/water emulsion and field gas feeds to Ellwood are considered to be naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures, which are exempt from RMP under paragraph 68.115(b)(2)(iii) until the field gas enters a natural gas processing plant (NAICS code 211112) or the crude oil/water emulsion enters a petroleum refining process unit (NAICS code 32411). \n \nRMP paragraph 68.3 provides the following definitions:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfNatural gas processing plant (gas plant) means any processing site engaged in the extraction of natural gas liquids from field gas, fractionation of mixed natural gas liquids to natural gas products or both\u00c2\u00bf. \n\n\u00c2\u00bfPetroleum refining process unit means a process unit used in an establishment primarily engaged in petroleum refining as defined in NAICS code 32411 for petroleum refining and used for the following: Producing transportation fuels (such as gasoline, diesel fuels and jet fuels), heating fuels (such as kerosene, fuel gas distillate, and fuel oils), or lubricants\u00c2\u00bf.\n\nThe natural gas processing plant at Ellwood produces both NGL and LPG.

In addition, sour gas meets the criteria for a toxic substance because it contains more than one weight percent of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nThe emulsion/crude oil is not covered because it is considered to be a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture prior to entry into a petroleum refining process unit. RMP paragraph 68.115 specifically defines naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures as including both crude oil and produced water, which are the products of the emulsion separation process.\n\nFuel gas is also considered as not covered per RMP paragraph 68.126, which states \u00c2\u00bfA flammable substance listed in Tables 3 and 4 of paragraph 68.130 is excluded from coverage when the substance is used as fuel at the source\u00c2\u00bf.\n\nThe next step is to determine if the natural gas processing unit contains more than the threshold quantity of any regulated substances. \n\nNGL and LPG are stored in tanks (V-227 and V-218) that each has a capacity of 45,000 gallons.

Therefore, there is more than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs for either ethane, propane, butane or pentane.  All equipment handling sour or sales gas is included as part of the covered process because it is connected to the NGL and LPG processing equipment (see definition of a process in RMP paragraph 68.3) and is not specifically excluded. \n\nThe field gas contains up to 20,000 ppmv of hydrogen sulfide. Field gas is handled in V-203 Inlet Scrubber and V-119 Outlet Separator before entering the LO-CAT unit which removes hydrogen sulfide from the field gas. The total equipment and interconnecting piping volume that contains sour gas with more than one weight percent hydrogen sulfide is estimated to be about 3100 cubic feet. Assuming field gas is processed at 70 psig and 60 F, the calculated weight of hydrogen sulfide in the covered process is about 32 lbs. This is far below the threshold quantity for hydrogen sulfide of 10,000 lbs and therefore does not need to be considered as a covered toxic substance.\n\nThe single covered process includes the sour field gas entering the facility, the NGL separation facilities, the sour gas sweetening and dehydration facilities, the LPG separation facilities, the NGL/LPG storage and truck loading facilities, the vapor recovery unit and the relief headers, thermal oxidizers and flare. Specifically excluded facilities include the oil emulsion heater treater, hydrogen sulfide stripper, crude surge tank and LACT unit, the produced water tank and the fuel gas system.\n\n1.4 Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Results\n\nDeleted from Executive Summary\n\n1.5 Summary of Accidental Release Prevention"

Based on the results of the offsite consequence analysis, the distance to the flammable endpoint for the worst-case release exceeds the distance to the nearest public receptor (the Sandpiper Golf Course and US Highway 101, each of which is about 0.1 miles from the facility boundary). Therefore according to RMP paragraph 68.10, the covered process is not eligible for Program 1 requirements. All of the facilities at the Ellwood Onshore Facility are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule under 29 CFR 1910.119. Therefore, the gas-processing unit meets the Program 3 eligibility requirements.\n\nIn addition to being subject to EPA RMP requirements the Ellwood Onshore Facility is subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions), the Ellwood Onshore Facility has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \n\nCompliance with PSM\u00c2\u00bfs comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes that handle flammable or toxic materials.  The objective of the PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Venoco has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective PSM program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach the following components were considered in the evaluation:  1) the process design; 2) process technology; 3) process changes; 4) operational and maintenance activities and procedures; 5) non-routine activities and procedures; 6) emergency preparedness plans and procedures; 7) training programs; and 8) other elements that affect the process.

PSM is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment.  The elements of the company\u00c2\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention program are summarized below:\n\nProcess Safety Information \u00c2\u00bf This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program and to a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards, technology and the equipment of the natural gas processing system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \u00c2\u00bf Is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable or toxic materials.  The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable or toxic materials.  As part of the company\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program the initial PHA of the Ellwood Onshore Facility  was conducted in 1999 and addressed potential impacts both on and offsite. The PHA has since been revalidated in 2004 and 2009.\n\nOperating Procedures \u00c2\u00bf As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the natural gas processing system are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this system.  As needed, changes or updates to the natural gas processing system-operating procedures are incorporated under the company\u00c2\u00bfs management of change program.\n\nEmployee Training \u00c2\u00bf Personnel performing specific tasks that affect the natural gas processing system must be qualified to perform their"

The company utilizes an established training program that ensures the training and competency of employees whose jobs require them to perform work which affect the natural gas processing system. \n\nMechanical Integrity \u00c2\u00bf Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable or toxic materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals.  As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\nManagement of Change \u00c2\u00bf Contemplated changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes to operating procedures.  The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for \u00c2\u00bfreplacements in kind\u00c2\u00bf) to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review \u00c2\u00bf As one of the requirements of PSM, Venoco is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Although the processes at the Ellwood Onshore Treatment Facility are essentially mature, and therefore the start up of new processes are not anticipated, a PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold.  For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround or modification, company policy ensures that any changes other than \u00c2\u00bfreplacement in kind\u00c2\u00bf made to the process during shutdown go through the manag"

An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the PSM standards.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the PSM system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the PSM program elements are effectively implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation \u00c2\u00bf A crucial part of Venoco\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented.  Accordingly, Venoco has an incident investigation program which requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable or toxic material.\n \nEmployee Participation Plan \u00c2\u00bf Venoco has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation and management of these PSM program elements.\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices \u00c2\u00bf Venoco has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.  These include (but are not limited to): lock-out/tag-out procedures for energy isolation of equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, and confined space entry procedures for work performed in confined spaces.\n\nContractor Safety \u00c2\u00bf Venoco, in following OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM Guidelines, has established a screening process so they hire only contractors who accomplish the desired tasks without compromising safety when working around or in the natural gas processing system.
