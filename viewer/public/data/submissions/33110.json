The Facility Policy:\nThe owners, management, and employess of Essex Elevator Inc. committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored should be 306,000 pounds in a 12,000 gallon storage tank, a 18,000 gallon storage tank, and 40 - 1,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi-tanker holding 36,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\nA.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of despersion to 200 ppm) is 2.0 miles.\n\nB.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint point of dispersion to 200 ppm is 2.0 miles.\n\n4. The accident release prevention program:\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute,"

The Five-year Accident History:\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n6.The emergency response program: \nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\nc. provided state and local authorities the emergency planing and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nd. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38, including pro-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe condidtions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommentions for implementation at this time."
