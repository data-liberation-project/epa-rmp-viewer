The release prevention program and the emergency response planning program are tools that assist us in assuring the safety of our employees, the general public and the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that are in place at the Pasadena plant, including: \n1.    a description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPAA?s RMP program, \n2.    a summary of results from our assessment of potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases,\n3.    a summary of our release prevention program,\n4.    a summary of the five-year release history of EPA RMP regulated chemicals, \n5.    a summary of our emergency response program, and \n6.    planned action to improve safety.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Albemarle Pasadena plant produces organic and inorganic chemicals, including a family of chemicals known as organometallics.   The primary use of these chemicals is as catalyst.  Organometallics are produced in specialized process equipment which are designed to maximum safety and efficiency of operations.  The manufacturing processes are also controlled by a computerized system that is monitored by highly trained operators.  The following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences should a substantial accidental release occur are used at the Albemarle Pasadena plant:\n\nToxics:\nMethyl Chloride\n\nFlammables:\n1-Butene,\nIsobutylene (2-methyl propene),\nIsopentane,\nEthyl Chloride.\n\nOur release prevention plan (Process Safety Management program) and contingency planning programs are tools that we use to manage the potential hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public and t"

This includes information about administrative controls and measures that we have in place to mitigate the distance of any release.\n\nWorst-case Scenario - Methyl Chloride (regulated toxic)\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage vessel containing 190,500 pounds of methyl chloride and the subsequent release of all contents in ten minutes.  Per the EPA guidelines, the release scenario assumes that all active safety systems fail, the worst weather condition occurs (stable, low wind speed), and that there is no emergency response to reduce the impact and risk.  RMP Comp was used to derive the information on the release scenario.  MARPLOT and LandView 6 software were used to plot the exposure radius and develop the population estimate for the exposed areas.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Methyl Chloride (regulated toxic)\n\nThe alternative scenario also involves methyl chloride.   This scenario involves the partial failure of a three (3) inch line exiting from the bottom of the vessel.  This scenario includes a response like would occur should this incident actually occur.  The weather conditions for the alternative scenario are also more realistic with winds from the southeast and wind speeds and temperature more common to the location.  Under conditions of this scenario, the other plants who share our Pasadena Chemical complex (i.e., MEMC, Inc.; ETHYL Corp; and Bigler Corp) are the ones affected.  The release does not extend into residential areas.  RMP Comp, MARPLOT and LandView 6 software were used to model the scenario.\n\nWorst-case Scenario - 1-Butene (regulated flammable)\n\nThe worst-case scenario for regulated flammables involves a storage vessel that contains 352,800 pounds of 1-butene.  This scenario involved the re"

In addition, the worst weather conditions (stable, low wind speed) were in place.  The worst-case regulated flammable was modeled using the RMP Comp software.  MARPLOT and LandView 6 software were used to plot the exposure radius and develop the population estimate for the exposed areas.  Should the vapor cloud resulting from this release ignite, the overpressure would be limited to the local industrial complex (that contains MEMC, ETHYL and Bigler).  The overpressure does not extend to any residential areas.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Isobutylene (2-methyl propene) [regulated flammable]\nThe alternative release scenario involves the flammable chemical isobutylene.  This scenario is more realistic than the worst-case scenario.  It involves damage to a six (6) inch nozzle exiting from the bottom of the vessel.  It is assumed that all systems are operational and a response is made by the Emergency Response Team (ERT).  In addition, it assumes that the weather conditions for this alternative scenario are the more common moderate wind from the southeast.  The temperature used in this scenario are based on ones common to this area.  Should this scenario actually occur, the only ones impacted would be the other companies (MEMC, ETHYL and Bigler) that coexist with Albemarle in our industrial complex.  No residential areas were impacted by this scenario.  As with the other scenarios, RMP Comp, MARPLOT and LandView 6 software was used to obtain an exposed population estimate.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAlbemarle has always believed in taking a structured, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  The most significant management system in place is the Process Safety Management Program.  Key features of this prevention program include the following sec"

Our emergency response plan is coordinated with that of the community, the Pasadena LEPC, the Channel Industries Mutual Aid Association (CIMA) and industrial neighbors who share our fence line (MEMC, Ethyl and Bigler).  This shared fence line defines our chemical complex.\n\nThe site emergency response team (ERT) is composed of members from all companies operating on the complex (MEMC, Ethyl, Bigler and Albemarle).  The ERT consist of  four sections that include the fire brigade, the haz-mat team, the rescue team and the emergency medical team.  All team members are trained to the hazardous materials technician level, which allows them to not only respond to fires, but also spills of hazardous material.  To assure that the ERT is ready for any complex emergency, frequent drills are held with our industrial neighbors on the complex.  In addition, the ERT also participates in the local mutual aid (CIMA) drills.  Drills are also used to evaluate the ability of complex personnel to understand and operate under the emergency plan.  In addition to our emergency personnel, our emergency response has a fully equipped ambulance, two fire trucks, a rescue vehicle and a haz-mat truck.  In addition to complex emergencies, these vehicles are also available to the Channel Industries Mutual Aid Association for off-plant responses.\n\nAlbemarle has the responsibility for maintaining the mobile emergency response equipment and for training of the members of the ERT.\n\nACTION TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n*Current Work Permit Auditing - All work permits (Confined Space Entry, Ignition Source Permits and Non-Ignition Source Permits) are audited to assure that we receive the maximum from them.\n*Installation HC detectors per PHA\n"
