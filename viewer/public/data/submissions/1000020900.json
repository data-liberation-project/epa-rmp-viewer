The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (\"UAN\") solutions.  Several processes within the CRNF Plant contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance; therefore, this facility is subject to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"USEPA\") Risk Management Program (\"RMP\") rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments (\"CAAA\") of 1990.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the RMP for the CRNF Plant.\n\nFacility Overview\n\nThe CRNF Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer-manufacturing complex producing anhydrous ammonia and UAN solutions.  The complex produces for market approximately 670,000 tons of UAN and 145,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually for use as agricultural fertilizers.  The design of the facility, which started production in July 2000, incorporates state-of-the-art safety and environmental controls for the protection of the employees and the surrounding community.  \n\nThe facility consists of an air separation unit, a gasification unit, a Selexol unit, a hydrogen purification unit, an ammonia synthesis unit, a urea unit, a nitric acid unit,  an ammonium nitrate-UAN unit, and storage and loading units for ammonia and UAN.  The air separation unit, while located on the CRNF site, is independently owned and operated by Linde Gases.  The air separation unit makes high purity oxygen and nitrogen for use in the gasification and ammonia production units.  In addition, Linde markets these gases along with argon to off-site customers. \n\nThe gasification unit produces hydrogen gas using the GE Energy Hydrogen Generation Process.  The gasifier produces raw hydrogen and carbon oxides by the partial oxidation of petroleum coke wi"

The petroleum coke is provided primarily by the neighboring Coffeyville Resources Refining and Marketing, LLC (\"CRRM\") Refinery and supplemented with coke from other locations.  The hydrogen is purified by shift conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, the removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in the Selexol unit, and removal of trace contaminants using pressure swing adsorption in the hydrogen purification unit.\n\nIn the ammonia synthesis unit the hydrogen from the hydrogen purification unit reacts with nitrogen from the air separation unit to make anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is either sold for direct fertilizer applications or upgraded for UAN solutions.  Ammonia along with by-product carbon dioxide removed from the hydrogen in the Selexol unit is used to produce liquid urea in the urea unit.  In the nitric acid unit, ammonia and air are also used to produce a weak nitric acid solution that is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product in the UAN unit. Ammonia and UAN solutions can be shipped to bulk distributors by both truck and railcar.  On-site storage tanks have been constructed to safely hold the ammonia and UAN products based on seasonal demand requirements.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nCRNF is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations by pursuing elimination or reduction of our use of toxic substances and minimizing our use of energy and generation of wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.  CRNF strives to prevent the generation of pollution at the source, but, where that cannot be achieved, CRNF is committed to environmentally sound methods of recycling, treatment, and disposal.  By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the q"

The gasification process substitutes high grade feedstock (natural gas) with a low-grade feedstock (petroleum coke -- the end product from the condensation process in oil cracking with poor fuel characteristics).  Substituting coke for natural gas in our process conserves over 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, which can be used for home heating, electrical power generation, or in the production of other materials.  The reliable source of raw material from the adjacent refinery reduces the energy required to transport the coke and allows for the potential return of energy or raw materials to the refinery.\n\nThe environmental design objective for this plant was to achieve significant emission reduction compared to the conventional nitrogen plant.  No hazardous solids are produced during normal operations.  The water effluent is sufficiently clean to enter the Coffeyville's municipal water treatment system.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Selexol unit, ammonia synthesis unit, urea unit, refrigerated atmospheric ammonia storage tank, pressurized ammonia bullet tanks, and water treatment constitute the processes covered by the USEPA RMP rule.  Regulated substances held in covered processes above the threshold quantity include anhydrous ammonia in the Selexol unit, ammonia synthesis unit, urea unit, refrigerated atmospheric ammonia storage tank, and pressurized ammonia bullet tanks and chlorine in water treatment.  Chlorine is used as a biological control agent in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases.

The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, mechanical integrity, safe work practices, incident investigation, program audits, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\nThe covered processes at the CRNF Plant adhere to the requirements of PSM and have written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and applicable USEPA RMP Prevention Programs.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in these programs.\n\nThe CRNF PSM/RMP Program consists of several elements and policies which are briefly outlined below.\n\n--\tEmployee Participation - Employees are involved in all aspects of the program and are provided any information developed in the program.  Employees participate in process reviews, assist with development of procedures, and all other aspects of the program.\n\n--\tProcess Safety Information (\"PSI\") - All necessary process information and records are accessible to employees including information on the hazards of the chemicals, process technology with safe operating limits, and equipment records and design requirements.\n\n--\tProcess Hazard Analysis (\"PHA\") - Process hazard analysis and review has been conducted by employee teams to identify and correct any perceived hazards.
