Global understands the shared value of safety and environmental protection for our employees, the public and the communities we serve as a vital component of our energy infrastructure. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance: \n\n\n\nThe Global Fort Edward Rail Yard is leased and operated by Global Companies LLC (Global), headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. Railroad operations at the site are performed by SMS Rail Services, Inc. (SMS).  At the rail yard, railcars of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are stored on railroad tracks, while awaiting future transportation to another storage location or destination facility for off-load.  Propane is the only Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) regulated chemical stored at the rail yard which exceeds a threshold quantity.   \n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\n\n\nThe Global Fort Edward Rail Yard is normally unmanned by Global personnel.  The site is visited periodically by Global employees for inspection purposes and to perform operating and maintenance tasks.  As such, the facility is considered a normally unoccupied remote facility and is not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. \n\n\n\nThe Global Fort Edward Rail Yard is regulated as a Program Level 2, CAP facility.  General accidental release prevention programs and propane-specific release prevention steps incorporated for the covered process include the following: \n\n\n\n--The rail yard is a secured facility, with locked gates to limit entry to authorized personnel only.  In addition to periodic inspections conducted by Global personnel, the site is also occupied by SMS"
