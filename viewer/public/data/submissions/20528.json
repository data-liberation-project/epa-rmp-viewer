The Pequannock Water Treatment Plant is owned by the City of Newark and operated by the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corporation(NWCDC). The chlorine system,used for disinfection, is the plant's only process that is subject to the EPA RMP Part 68 and NJAC 7:31\nToxic Catastrophe Prevention Act(TCPA) Regulations. The chlorine process is located at the Pre-Treatment Building which is seperate from the Treatment Plant.\n\nChlorine is stored in steel one-ton containers in the Chlorine Storage Room, within the Pre-Treatment Plant Building, Which is of sound masonry construction.\n\nThe City of Newark has maintained an \" approved \" Risk Management Plan Program under the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) For the chlorine process since approximately 1988. The current City of Newark/NWCDC Program includes a complete chlorine safety program including extensive operator training, emergency response training, standard operating procedures, and chlorine safety equipment. The chlorine process utilizes state of the art design for all piping and equipment, including all necessary chlorine monitors, alarms and controls.\n\nEmergency response procedures include an on-site emergency response team, as well as off-site response from local emergency response agencies. Annual emergency response drills are conducted, which include onsite and off-site responders.\n\nThe City of Newark/NWCDC written Risk Management Program includes all necessary Prevention Program elements, meeting the requirements of EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management. The Prevention Program includes elements such as safety information, standard operating procedures, operator training, preventive maintenance, hot works permits and other safety programs to ensure that the chlorine process meets the highest possible safety standards.\n\nThere have been no reportable catastrophic or near catastrophic chlorine acc"

      "SummaryText": "idents at the Pequannock Water Treatment Plant to date.\n\nAs required by the EPA Rule, the worst-case release scenario for the chlorine process is the release of the entire contents of a one-ton container of chlorine(2000 lbs.) within 10 minutes. According to Exhibit 4-4 in the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint (concentration of 3 ppm) for this scenario is 1.3 miles for the area surronding the Pre-Treatment Building. The worst-case scenario is considered to be an unlikely release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the chlorine process was determined to be an indoor liquid chlorine release due to the rupture of a 1\" diameter header pipe. The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential release event than the worst-case scenario. According to Exhibit 4-12 in the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint (concentration of 3 ppm) for this scenario is .4 miles for the area surrounding the Pre-Treatment Building.\n\nThe installation of remote operated valve actuators for the chlorine ton containers has been completed.\nThe remote operated valve actuators allow the chlorine container to be immediatley closed from a remote location (i.e. the Treatment Plant, lobby of the Pre-Treatment Building) in the event of a significant chlorine release. New chlorine detectors have also been provided for the chlorine process as a risk reduction measure."
