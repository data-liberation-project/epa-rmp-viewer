If an emergency were to occur, it is policy to notify the Dixie Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.   \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY:  \n\nThis facility is a J-T (Pressure Drop) Natural Gas Liquids Extraction Plant.  Natural Gas enters the facility into a separator where the pressure is reduced thus causing a chilling effect that condenses the heavier components of the gas, such as propane, into liquid form.  The liquids are sent to a 42,000-gallon storage tank via pipe where it is metered and shipped off-site via tank truck.  The truck loading station is located down gradient to the tank and is gravity fed from the tank.  The natural gas, after liquids extraction, is then routed to compressors where the pressure is boosted and shipped off-site via a pipeline.   \n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  \n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of our 42,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 125F), resulting in vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a truck pull away before disconnect leading to a 10 minute release and fire.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite.  There are no public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC  PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have never had an accide"
