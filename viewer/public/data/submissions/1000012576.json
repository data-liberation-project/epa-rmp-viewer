      "SummaryText": "Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. (Kemira) operates in a facility located at 3761 Canal Street, East Chicago, Indiana.  This facility manufactures ferric chloride (FeCl3), ferrous chloride (FeCl2) and other chemicals for the water treatment industry using chlorine gas as one of the raw materials.  Chlorine has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which requires the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Chlorine is the only chemical on the EPA list present at the Kemira facility in an amount and concentration exceeding the applicability threshold.  In addition, due to the presence of chlorine, Kemira is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and is submitting a program level 3 Risk Management Plan.\n\nChlorine is a listed toxic substance under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and is subject to those regulations since it is stored in quantities in excess of 2,500 pounds.\n\nKemira utilizes chlorine as a raw material to produce FeCl3.  Kemira receives railcars with chlorine, Spent Pickle Liquor (SPL), and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) at their East Chicago facility.  Chlorine gas is received in 90-ton (180,000 lb) rail tank cars.  Normally, six (6) rail tank cars at a time are present onsite, but occasionally up to 20 rail tank cars could be present.  Only one rail car is connected to the process at any one time.  The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this facility is 3,600,000 pounds.  This substance is stored in rail tank cars under ambient temperature conditions, which could exceed 100 degrees F in the summertime.  Normal internal pressure is 60 to 70 psi, but on a hot day pressures may reach 180 psi in the process.\n\nChlorine gas is piped from the railcars to the reaction vessels (chlorinators), where it reacts with ferrous chloride to form ferric chloride.  There are three reaction vessels.  Each reaction vessel is fitte"

In case of a reaction vessel over pressurization, spring-loaded pressure relief valves would discharge the chlorine into a process tank of ferric chloride.  In the unlikely event of a continued over pressurization, a rupture disk is utilized as an additional safety feature and the chlorine is captured.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nAll design has been based on what will result in the safest and most environmentally sound operation.  The process is a proprietary closed system.  The portion of scrap iron and carbon not digested ends up in a filter press, which is shipped offsite to a landfill.\n\nRMP regulations require offsite consequence analysis for a potential release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  Kemira is required to consider two release scenarios, identified as a worst case and an alternative scenario.  The worst case scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over a 10 minute period due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  To determine the area of impact, Kemira used an air dispersion modeling program named RMP*COMP which is recommended by the EPA.\n\nWorst -case release scenario\nThe Clean Air Act risk management planning regulations require Kemira to prepare a worst-case scenario consisting of the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel containing a regulated chemical in 10 minutes.  The largest chlorine-containing vessel is a rail car, whose content totals 90 tons (or 180,000 pounds).  Therefore, the rate of release would be 9 tons/minute (18,000 pounds/minute).  RMP*Comp (version 1.07), assists in estimating the distance to a toxic endpoint in the event of a release as described above.  The U.S. EPA\u00c2\u00bfs"

      "SummaryText": "RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provides tables for obtaining toxic endpoints and exhibit B-1 of this guidance document provided 0.0087 mg/L as the toxic endpoint for chlorine.\n\nAlternative scenarios\nFor the alternative scenario, the following assumptions were made:  On a hot day, a one inch diameter flexible line connecting the railcar to the rest of the process has a slow leak (not a complete break) from a 0.125 diameter hole.  The line pressure is assumed to be 180 psig.  A chlorine sensor is located about 5 feet horizontally from the rail car and about 15 feet below the hose, and should be activated almost immediately (within less than 1 minute) turning on a visual and audible alarm.  An operator will don a respirator, proceed to the control room, identify the source of the leak and isolate it within 20 minutes.  In those 20 minutes, the RMP*Comp software yields a distance to the toxic endpoint of less than 0.1 mile.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\nIt is the policy of Kemira to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which Kemira handles chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are employed, and the training of Kemira personnel.  The owners and management of this facility regard employee and public safety as a very serious matter and have taken many precautions to maintain a safe working and public environment.  \n\nSome of these steps include:\nInstallation of chlorine sensors and alarms;\nInstallation of an automatic shutoff valve on the railcar unloading system;\nInstitution of safe operating procedures;\nTraining employees in safety programs and procedures;\nWriting a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan; and\nCoordinating with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThe Kemira East Chicago facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with"

This facility has a strong commitment to the safe handling of chlorine and to minimizing the probability of an accidental release.  This is achieved through a combination of personnel training, process safety equipment and operating procedures.\n\nFive-year accident history\nThe Kemira East Chicago facility has been operational since 2005.  Since that time there have not been any accidental releases of chlorine that led to deaths or injuries of people onsite or offsite or a response or restoration activities at any of the environmental receptors in the last five years.  None of the employees or contractors has been involved in any accidents related to the hazardous substance defined in section 112(r) that is stored or handled at this facility.  Kemira has developed and implemented an extensive program for investigating and follow-up of all accidents/incidents, which may occur in the future at the East Chicago facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response program.  The Emergency Response Plan contains specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of chlorine, procedures to inform the public and health care information.  All employees working with chlorine are given 40-hour Hazardous Waste Operator (HAZWOPER) training with annual 8-hour refreshers.  This plan is coordinated with the Lake County LEPC and was developed in cooperation with the East Chicago Emergency Management Agency.  Kemira\u00c2\u00bfs personnel are trained to respond to accidental releases of the onsite regulated substance.
