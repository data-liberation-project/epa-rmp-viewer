The Facility Policy\n  The owners, management and employees of Crystal Valley Co-op at St. Clair are committed to the \n  prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur,\n  the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities, to mitigate and release\n  and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used\n  for crop production nutrients. \n  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 130,000 lbs. in our 30,000 gal. storage tank and nurse\n  tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck tank holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n  3.  Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and \n        alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security\n        sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n  4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n  The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the\n  Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n  Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. In addition, MN. Dept. Of Ag. Rules.\n\n  5.  The Five-year Accident History\n  a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n  have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge\n  have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, ev"
