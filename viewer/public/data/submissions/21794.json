Chemical safety is a number one priority with support from the highest level of\nmanagement.  The Environmental and Safety Department reports directly to the Vice President,\nwho reports directly to the CEO and President. Thus Senior Management promotes safety and\nenvironmental compliance.\n\n     There are many programs in place to promote chemical safety and the facility is usually\nsubjected to at least four surprise inspections a year by different governmental agencies.  The\nhazardous waste incineration industry is one of the most highly regulated in the country.  Not\nonly does LWD comply with numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs such as Risk Management Plan (RMP), it\nalso complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, the Emergency\nPlanning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) programs, State and Local Fire Code\nprograms, and the National Electrical Code programs.   To even further promote chemical safety,\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)\nalso regulates the facility. \n\n     As part of the RMP and PSM programs, LWD's chemical safety program begins with quality\nassurance for all equipment, piping systems, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, controls,\nemergency systems, and pumps.  This guarantees that these units meet all applicable design\ncodes and specifications.  Thi"

An\nemployee participation plan ensures that employees are involved throughout the program adding\nexperience and a working knowledge of the process to the safety suggestions.  This combination\nof engineering, process information, and analysis is supplemented by trained employees working\nwith specific operating instructions to address all contingencies to ensure operations are\nconducted within safe limits.  \n\n     The facility has layers of protection built into its process.  The first level includes the\npersonnel.  Trained operators are working with operating instructions and process safety\ninformation to keep the process operation safe and in environmental compliance.  The second\nlevel involves technical controls.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to\nmaintain the process within these limits.  Process safety control systems include: relief vents;\ncheck valves; manual shutoffs; interlocks; alarms; a keyed bypass; grounding equipment; and a\npurge system. \n\nMonitoring and detection systems include: process area monitors; personal monitors; portable\nmonitors; camera systems; special indicator paint; and daily inspections by trained safety\npersonnel.  In addition, each shift has a designated trained supervisor to be responsible for\nenvironmental and safety compliance. \n\n     To supplement and enhance these on-site programs, LWD participates in several\norganizations which promote safe environmental and chemical practices.  As a member of the\nCalvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) it can rely on pooled resources from\nsurrounding plants and communities.

LWD\nis also a member of the Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration in which detailed safety\nand compliance information is shared to further promote the safe and effective thermal treatment\nof hazardous wastes.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n     The facility, which is located in Calvert City, KY, includes three hazardous waste\nincinerators and affiliated hazardous waste storage facilities.  Many of the chemical safety\nprocedures mentioned previously are designed specifically for chemicals handled by the facility,\nwhich include familiar household products such as paints, adhesives, herbicides, pesticides,\ncleaners, and solvents.  Specifically, the Risk Management Chemicals at the LWD facility\ninclude Hydrogen Fluoride, Formaldehyde, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, Isobutane, Butadiene, 2-\nButene-cis and Vinyl Methyl Ether.  Many of these items would be immediately recognizable by\nthe average individual if trade names were used instead of chemical names.  The major difference\nis the volume of waste that a household would produce versus an industrial application.  Where a\nhousehold would have a gallon of drain cleaner stored in a safe place away from the reach of\nsmall children, LWD would have hundreds of gallons stored in a safe place away from persons\nunaware of the hazards.  Chemicals such as hydrogen fluoride, commonly used as a wheel\ncleaner or an oven cleaner, and isobutane, which is a common non-CFC aerosol propellant, are\nincluded in the release scenarios for the Risk Management Plan.  Just as in a household, these\nchemicals are not always present.

The worst\ncase scenario as defined by EPA for the RMP rule does not allow for any active action to prevent\nthe release.  It also assumes worst case conditions for the release in its calculations.  There are\nmany active control systems, described previously, to prevent an incident from occurring.

Although there are active controls and\nmeasures directed at preventing and controlling the consequences of such releases, no credit was\ntaken for active mitigation methods in evaluating these alternative scenarios.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps   \n\n     LWD has a general accident release prevention program which includes extensive classroom\nand on the job training for all its employees.  This training also requires each employee take a\ncompetency exam.  This program instructs the employee in safe working practices, ranging from\nthe proper operation of a fork lift to the process operations.  Monthly training on various topics,\nranging from sampling of materials to hot work permits, keeps safety and environmental\ncompliance paramount in the minds of the employees.
