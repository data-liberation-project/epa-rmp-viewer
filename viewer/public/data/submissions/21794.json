Chemical safety is a number one priority with support from the highest level of\nmanagement.  The Environmental and Safety Department reports directly to the Vice President,\nwho reports directly to the CEO and President. Thus Senior Management promotes safety and\nenvironmental compliance.\n\n     There are many programs in place to promote chemical safety and the facility is usually\nsubjected to at least four surprise inspections a year by different governmental agencies.  The\nhazardous waste incineration industry is one of the most highly regulated in the country.  Not\nonly does LWD comply with numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs such as Risk Management Plan (RMP), it\nalso complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, the Emergency\nPlanning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) programs, State and Local Fire Code\nprograms, and the National Electrical Code programs.   To even further promote chemical safety,\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs Process Safety\nManagement (PSM) and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)\nalso regulates the facility. \n\n     As part of the RMP and PSM programs, LWD's chemical safety program begins with quality\nassurance for all equipment, piping systems, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, controls,\nemergency systems, and pumps.  This guarantees that these units meet all applicable design\ncodes and specifications.  Thi"

Although these safety systems are\nin place, the worst case scenario does not take into account any of the responses that the trained\noperators may implement.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\n     The five-year accident history for the facility includes one reportable incident under RMP.\nThe incident occurred in 1997 when an employee did not properly close a valve and material\nleaked causing a flash fire from which one employee received burns.  Operating procedures were\nrevised and additional training was conducted to prevent any reoccurrence  The incident was\nattributed to human error.  The release did not result in any off-site consequences, nor has the\nfacility ever had any RMP release that resulted in off-site consequences.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n     \n     In compliance with the RMP rule and Part 270.25(a)(7) and Subpart D of Part 264 (264.50\nthrough 56) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulation, LWD has maintained a\nContingency Plan detailing procedures to minimize hazards to human health or the environment\nfrom fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or\nhazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water.  This contingency plan provides an\nexplicit description of the response procedures to be implemented in an emergency situation\nwhich will protect the public, workers on the site, and the environment. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n     LWD is committed to safely providing solutions to society's hazardous waste management\nneeds.  The programs in place will continue to be improved as technology and science improves. \nWe are committed to making chemical safety a number one priority through safe-operating\nprocedures, trained personn"

An\nemployee participation plan ensures that employees are involved throughout the program adding\nexperience and a working knowledge of the process to the safety suggestions.  This combination\nof engineering, process information, and analysis is supplemented by trained employees working\nwith specific operating instructions to address all contingencies to ensure operations are\nconducted within safe limits.  \n\n     The facility has layers of protection built into its process.  The first level includes the\npersonnel.  Trained operators are working with operating instructions and process safety\ninformation to keep the process operation safe and in environmental compliance.  The second\nlevel involves technical controls.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to\nmaintain the process within these limits.  Process safety control systems include: relief vents;\ncheck valves; manual shutoffs; interlocks; alarms; a keyed bypass; grounding equipment; and a\npurge system. \n\nMonitoring and detection systems include: process area monitors; personal monitors; portable\nmonitors; camera systems; special indicator paint; and daily inspections by trained safety\npersonnel.  In addition, each shift has a designated trained supervisor to be responsible for\nenvironmental and safety compliance. \n\n     To supplement and enhance these on-site programs, LWD participates in several\norganizations which promote safe environmental and chemical practices.  As a member of the\nCalvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP) it can rely on pooled resources from\nsurrounding plants and communities.

Many of the chemical safety\nprocedures mentioned previously are designed specifically for chemicals handled by the facility,\nwhich include familiar household products such as paints, adhesives, herbicides, pesticides,\ncleaners, and solvents.  Specifically, the Risk Management Chemicals at the LWD facility\ninclude Hydrogen Fluoride, Formaldehyde, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, Isobutane, Butadiene, 2-\nButene-cis and Vinyl Methyl Ether.  Many of these items would be immediately recognizable by\nthe average individual if trade names were used instead of chemical names.  The major difference\nis the volume of waste that a household would produce versus an industrial application.  Where a\nhousehold would have a gallon of drain cleaner stored in a safe place away from the reach of\nsmall children, LWD would have hundreds of gallons stored in a safe place away from persons\nunaware of the hazards.  Chemicals such as hydrogen fluoride, commonly used as a wheel\ncleaner or an oven cleaner, and isobutane, which is a common non-CFC aerosol propellant, are\nincluded in the release scenarios for the Risk Management Plan.  Just as in a household, these\nchemicals are not always present.
