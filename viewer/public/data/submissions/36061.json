The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design and construction of the facility complies with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility came on line in 1995.  There have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of toxic substance that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u00bfs Specialist or Technician Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the New Orleans Fire Department and its Hazmat Team for releases related to the toxic process.  Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility resolves recommendations from PHA\u00bfs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we transfill anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride, in amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, and relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility, and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplements the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the transfilling of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is brought on site by railcar.  From the railcar, the regulated substance is transferred through a series of heat exchangers and pumps to the tube trailers and cylinders.  Also, tube trailers and cylinder storage of hydrogen chloride are maintained.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  The maximum amount of this substance contained in the transfill process is 360,00 pounds of anhydrous"
