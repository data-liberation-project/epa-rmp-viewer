      "SummaryText": "Facility Overview\n\nThe Riverside Extrusion Operation is located at 2345 Fleetwood Driver, Riverside, Ca. , \n(See Maps A and B in Appendix A of this section) it is bordered on the north by Duracoat Inc, on the south by Fleetwood Drive, on the east by C-Thru Industries, and on the west by a storm water channel and Fleetwood Corp. \n\nDistances from the Riverside Extrusion Operation Building to the property lines:\n\n(See map C under maps in Appendix A of this Section)\n\nNorth, 54 feet from building wall to fence line (Duracoat Inc.).\n\nSouth, 58.10 feet from building wall to curb line on Fleetwood Drive.\n\nEast 135.7 feet from building wall to C-Thru Industries.\n\nWest, 54 feet from building wall to storm water channel. \n\nThe Riverside Extrusion operates two 1800 ton extrusion presses one 2500 ton extrusion press and a Cast House which utilizes two 150000 Lb. re-melt furnaces for billet casting. Billets are utilized by our extrusion presses located at our Riverside and Fontana facilities. In addition, a nitrogen/ammonia heat treating system (Nitriding Process) is installed to treat steel extrusion dies. This nitriding system was built and designed by Procedyne Corporation of New Brunswick, NJ. \n\nNitriding Process \n\nThe nitriding process is used to treat the surfaces of the steel extrusion dies used in the aluminum extrusion process. The use of nitrogen onto the surface of an extrusion tool steel by holding at a temperature 1010 deg F. in contact with a ammonia helps produce a hard wear resistant surface which extends the life of the extrusion die. Extrusion dies are nitrided as a regular program of tooling maintenance. \n\n\nA diagram detailing the nitriding process is in Appendix B of this section."
