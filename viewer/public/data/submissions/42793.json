      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND\n\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. is engaged in the manufacturing in the manufacture and sale of a disversified line of consumer and health products.  Operations at the Harrisonville distribution center began in June of 2001.  The Harrisonville plant consist of administration offices, warehouse storage, manufacturing area and shipping areas.  This facility warehouses and distributes regulated products but does not manufacture them. \n\nThe Harrisonville distribution buildings include 395,000 square feet of warehouse storage capactiy.  The manufacturing building is 150,000 square feet.  The Harrisonville plant operates five days a week, eight hours per day, and employs 170 people.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the reciept and storage of aerosol product in consumer size containers.  Product is moved within the warehouse via forklift trucks.\n\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol product.  The hydrocarbons are defined by the environmental protection agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling materials.  Additionally, the US Occupational Safey and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol prodcut propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Harrisonville, MO plant has no history of accidental releases.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nthe USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as worst and alternate case scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is defined as the sudden loss of containment of material in the largest tank, vessel or container.  The worst case scenario assumes the sudden release of aerosol from a case of consumer packaged products.  The alternate release scenario also assumes the release of aerosol from consumer packaged products.  The worst cas"

      "SummaryText": "e release scenario assumes that several highly unlikely events occur simultaneously such as:\n\n- Catastrophic failure of aerosol within a case\n- Failure of all automated safety and alarm systems\n- Failure of trained operators to respond appropriately\n- The event occurs during least likely stagnant meteorological condition\n\nThe USEPA developed guidance (Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses) was used to complete the modeling of the worst case release scenario.  The modeling shows that the distance to endpoint would be 0.01 miles and therefore there would be no impact on the surrounding community.  Therefore, the Harrisonville Distribution Center is defined as a Program 1 facility.  A Program 1 facility, as defined by the USEPA, presents a minimal risk to the community.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nChruch and Dwight Co., Inc. has developed programs to comply with the required environmental health and safety standards.\n\nWe take a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs witch include:\n\n- Process safety information\n- Pre-start up review\n- Process hazard analysis\n- Compliance audits\n- Operating procedures\n- Accident investigations\n- Training\n- Employee participation\n- Mechanical integrity\n- Hot work permit\n- Management of change\n- Contractor safety\n\nIn addition to our management programs, specially designed to control, prevent, detect and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouse.  Aerosol storage racks are equipped with ESFR in-rack sprinkler systems.  All of our forklift operators are trained and certified.  Our firewater and sprinkler systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChurch and Dwght Co., Inc. strives for continuous improvement of its safety program.  We train our employees to safely perform their a"

We encourage employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including forklift trucks.  Our systems and programs are routinely audited, typically by an outside company or insurance carrier to evaluate their effectiveness.  Hand held dry fire extinguishers meet local code.\n\nWe are persently reviewing equipment and procedures recommendations identified during a process hazard analysis performed by an independent expert with the participation of our facility personnel.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\n\nChurch and Dwight Co., Inc. has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  Our plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  Our plan has been shared with the Cass County fire department and the Cass County LEPC.\n\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, Church and Dwight Co., Inc.  will work closely with local, county and state agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency."
