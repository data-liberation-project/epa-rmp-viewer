The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The incident response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Burnside is coordinated with the Gonzales Fire Department, Ascension Parish LEPC and St. James Parish LEPC. Coordination includes periodic meeting of Burnside personnel with the LEPCs and the Fire Chief to discuss needs and concerns in the event of an incident. Burnside has around-the-clock communications capability with the Ascension Parish LEPC and the St. James Parish LEPC, who have the ability to communicate to all state, federal and county agencies as to needed equipment (i.e., firefighting equipment, manpower, ambulances, hospitals, law enforcement, and HAZMAT operations). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic meetings with the Fire Chief and the area LEPCs, Burnside conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Ascension Parish LEPC, the St. James Parish LEPC, Fire Department, and emergency response organizations.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nBurnside will promptly investigate all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Veolia Burnside Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, Veolia does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2. Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Burnside Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the contents of the oleum tank, a sulfur trioxide railcar with no shipping papers, or the sulfur trioxide piping would have an off-site impact, as determined by the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the OCA Guidance Document. Railcars are typically shipped out as soon as they are loaded.\r\n\r\nAlternative Releases\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.

Based on process knowledge, Veolia identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.

In addition, a railcar containing sulfur trioxide may rarely be stored on site for a short time without active shipping papers (Process 2).\r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).
