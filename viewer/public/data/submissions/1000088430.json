The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Pearl City Elevator are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,200 pounds in the facilities 1 x 30,000-gallon storage tank. We also store nurse tanks at this location. \r\n\r\n3.  The worst-case release scenario: NOT DISCLOSED\r\n\r\nThe alternative-case release scenario: NOT DISCLOSED\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with  the Rules and        \r\n     Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure \r\n     Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These regulations \r\n     Administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI \r\n     K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous \r\n     Ammonia.\r\n\r\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\r\n      \r\n      There have been no releases of ammonia from this facility in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n6.   The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action \r\n      plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local\r\n      authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as \r\n      required under SARA Title III of EPCRA."

Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at \r\nthe facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe\r\npractices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\r\nrecommendations for implementation at this time. Facility will comply with changes to IDOA ammonia regulations when published as directed by IDOA NH3 inspector."
