We have an Emergency Response Plan which assigns responsibilities for preventing hazardous releases.\n\nIn regard to Chlorine safety, we take special care to ensure that Chlorine containers are properly handled and stored to prevent any loss of product.  We only use containers which have been previously tested to make sure they are safe and leak free.  We follow OSHA's Process Safety Management procedures to ensure safe working practices, and to eliminate any possible safety problems.  We also plan to reduce the amount of Chlorine held in storage.  We continue to have a perfect safety record with Chlorine and with the safety procedures in place, our record should remain perfect.\n\nIn regard to Hydrochloric Acid safety, this material is stored outside, away from strong acids, strong alkalies, reactive metals, and other incompatible materials.  We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency spill or other release of liquid and vapor."
