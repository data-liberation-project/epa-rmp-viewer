      "SummaryText": "The Versailles Water Treatment Plant is located at 5265 Tyrone Pike in Woodford County, Kentucky.  The system utilizes gaseous chlorine liquified under pressure to disinfect water for delivery through underground piping throughout the county.  The chlorine is stored in cylinders each containing 2,000 pounds with a maximum amount on-site of 8,000 pounds, with two tanks of 4,00 pounds in-line at any given time.  In a worst case release all 8,000 pounds would escape via a terroristic explosion resulting in rupture and vaporization of all contents within approximately 10 minutes affecting a radius of 3.0 miles with a population of approximately 5,000 people.  An alternative release would be a single 4,000 pound cylinder at 100 pounds per minute for 40 minutes affecting a radius of 0.5 miles and 300 people.  The actual effects of a release may be highly dependent upon wind direction since the facility is located near a high bluff above the Kentucky River.  Although the primary responding agency is the Versailles Fire Department and the Woodford County LEPC, the Anderson County counterpart may also be heavily involved due to the proximity of the county boundary."
