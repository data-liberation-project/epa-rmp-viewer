(CFI) accidental release risk management plan involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and maintenance and management practices. The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) used on site. The CFI facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community. CFI's emergency response program is in compliance with the EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the \"One Plan\".\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCFI repackages chlorine into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers). In addition, CFI manufactures 10.5% sodium hypochlorite. Sulfur dioxide U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks are stored at the site for distribution. The facility includes a private sidetrack for unloading chlorine railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks.  The sodium hypochlorite manufacturing and quality control testing is performed in the powell room.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection system continuously monitors all production and storage locations. Based upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a \"covered process\", the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe CFI accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n1) Compli"

The plan includes the following elements:\n\n1) description of chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes,\n\n2) recommended first aid for chlorine and sulfur dioxide exposures,\n\n3) a current list of all emergency equipment onsite and where such equipment is located,\n\n4) a current list of onsite and offsite emergency response personnel and contact numbers,\n\n5) detailed description of company personnel,\n\n6) a current list of emergency and non-emergency contact numbers,\n\n7) procedures for reporting and handling the releases,\n\n8) site and evacuation plans,\n\n9) procedures for plan review and update as well as training requirements for emergency responders.\n\n"
