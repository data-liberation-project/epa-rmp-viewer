Hill Power Station is one of nine natural gas fueled power generating facilities in the Central Power and Light Company subsidiary, which includes a total of 11 generating facilities throughout South Texas. This site is within the Corpus Christi city limits in Nueces County. The facility has 35 employees.\n\nCentral Power and Light Company is an investor-owned utility supplying electric service to a 44,000-square-mile area of South Texas.  The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquarterd in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility is a four unit steam electric power station with a total generation of 510 mw.  It burns natural gas as the primary fuel with #2 fuel oil as the secondary fuel.  Units 1 and 2, rated at 60 and 66 mw, were installed in 1952 and 1954 respectively.  Unit 3, at 150 mw, was installed in 1959, and Unit 4, at 234 mw was installed in 1969.  Units 1, 2, and 3 have General Electric turbines and Unit 4 has a Westinghouse turbine.  Steam is provided by four Babcock and Wilcox boilers.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the Central Power and Light Company Lon C. Hill Power Station on Callicoatte Road in northwest Corpus Christi.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Lon"

      "SummaryText": " C. Hill Power Station has been producing electricity for over 40 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alternative release scenario, are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community, based upon extreme conditions, defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (April 1999). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do not allow complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Lon C. Hill Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 3.0 miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Lon C. Hill Power Station involves the failure of a one- fourth inch pigtail or similar connection releasing chlorine for a duration of 60 minutes. The resulting cloud extends 0.3 miles down wind.\n\nCPL's chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some o"
