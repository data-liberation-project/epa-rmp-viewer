Accordingly, ESG has developed a proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Tupelo Wastewater Treatment Plant RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and chlorination/dechlorination processes and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\n\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, regulated chemicals under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed rega"

The chlorine storage and chlorination process has not changed since the time of the first RMP submission in June 1999.  The employees that work on the systems are properly trained in the safe operation and handling of these systems.  Refresher training is provided to the employees regularly.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and response. \n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Tupelo Wastewater Treatment Plant owned by the City of Tupelo is located at 2062 International Drive in Tupelo, Lee County, Mississippi.  The Tupelo WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  ESG operates the City of Tupelo's activated sludge wastewater treatment plant consisting of fine screening and grit removal, orbals (oxidation ditch), circular clarifiers and chlorine contact chambers followed by cascade aeration.  The project also operates and maintains approximately 76 lift stations and various lagoons throughout the city and county.  The plant is designed to treat an average daily flow of 8.0 MGD and a peak average daily flow of 12 MGD.\n\n\n\nThe Tupelo WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide as a dechlorinating agent prior to discharge.  The  City of Tupelo is regulated under the RMP rule because of the quantities of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.  As required by the RMP Regulation, ESG Operations, Inc. has updated the Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n3.0     General Accidental Release Prev"
