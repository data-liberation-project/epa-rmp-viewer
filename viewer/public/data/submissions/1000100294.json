Nevertheless, Vignolo - Potato Shed continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Vignolo - Potato Shed's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vignolo - Potato Shed's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nVignolo - Potato Shed has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Vignolo - Potato Shed has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Vignolo - Potato Shed now thinks of the RMP-PSM program"

The chlorine, when added to water, yields both chloric (HCl) and hypochlorous (HOCl) acid (see chemical\r\n\r\nequation below) in aqueous solution. This combination is effective in killing bacteria, viruses, pathogens and other micro-\r\norganisms. Note that the equation below is easily reversible which results in off-gassing of chlorine gas from water that\r\n\r\ncontains high concentrations of the acids.\r\n\r\nCl2 + H2O &#8594; HOCl + HCl\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process begins with the chlorine gas being drawn from the ton container through a pressure reducing\r\nvalve, reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted inside one of three chlorinators, metered through a\r\nmanually-adjusted rate valve, and finally injected into water.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of chlorine in annual safety meetings.
