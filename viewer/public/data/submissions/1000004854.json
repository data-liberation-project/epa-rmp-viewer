If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.\tFacility Information:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, in rail cars until it can be converted to fertilizer.\n\u00c2\u00b7\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 157590 pounds in a 36,000 gallon  rail car.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 157590 pounds is rounded to 160000 pounds.\n\n\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a   tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 157590 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest rail car at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 157590 pounds is rounded to 160000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.6 miles.\nb.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n\n\n\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of \u00c2\u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1\u00c2\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00c2\u00bfStorage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u00c2\u00bf.\n\n5.\tThe Fiv"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
