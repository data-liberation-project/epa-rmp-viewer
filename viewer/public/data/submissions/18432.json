Facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Agriservices of Brunswick, LLC @ Mendon, \nMissouri (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of\nanhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\nprepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and\nminimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to\nfarmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\nPropane is stored for grain drying.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one tank of 12,000\ngallons capacity.  The maximum amount stored is 51,000 pounds.  Propane is stored in \none tank of 18,000 gallons capacity.  The maximum amount stored is 56,610 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest tank\n      as follows:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia - The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds,\nwhich represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited\nby design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts\nper million, or ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\nPropane - The maximum quantity released would be 56,610 pounds.  The distance \nto the endpoint (point of 1.0 pounds per square inch, psi, as an explosive vapor cloud)\nis 0.3 miles or 1,585 feet.\n\nb.  The alternate release scenarios, based on either the five-year accident history or the\n     most likely potential incident as follows:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia - The alternate release scenario is a release from a break in a \n3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic\nor ma"

The active mitigation \ndevices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the\nhose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint\n(point of 1.0 psi overpressure as an explosive vapor cloud) is 0.3 miles or 175 feet.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provision of the U.S.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  It was also reviewed in accordance with the 1992\nEdition of the National fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 58.  Both standards\nare referened in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThe have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five\nyears that:  have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility;\nnor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in \nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergeny Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\n     right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard\n     29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety. \n\n Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the m"
