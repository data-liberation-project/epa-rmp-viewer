Various emergency controls are activated; exhaust fans may be used to expel ammonia from the facility or doors may be closed if it is determined that the release should be contained.  Local emergency officials are immediately notified and requested to assist by dialing 911. \n\n\n\n6. Planned Improvements\n\nAny areas of improvement that can be identified in audits, hazard analyses and inspections are identified, and corrective actions are taken in the event a recommendation is made.\n\n"
