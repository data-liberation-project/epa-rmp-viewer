The chlorine system at this facility is managed and equipped to minimize any release of harmful chemicals from this facility.\n \n2. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES - The regulated chemical in use that this water treatment plant is chlorine which is utilized for disinfection as required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Chlorine is purchased for use at this facility in one ton (2,000 lb) cylinders.  The facility will have no more than three of these cylinders (6,000 lbs total) on site during the normal course of operation.  \n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - Supervisors and employees routinely walk over the plant site and discuss the potential hazards in the work place.  New employees are taken on a tour of the plant site as part of their orientation at which time they are shown the potential hazards that exist.  In addition, OSHA approved material safety data sheets are utilized in employee training and are kept on hand at the facility for quick reference in the event of an emergency.  \n\nPersonnel are required to attend regularly scheduled training sessions.  These sessions are conducted by supervisors, fire department, police department, local emergency planning personnel, insurance experts, or other people who are well informed in responding to emergency chemical releases.  Records of these meetings are documented and kept on file.\n\nEquipment is inspected on a daily basis and is maintained on a schedule recommended by the manufacturer.  Records of these activities are kept on file at the facility.  Written procedures and schedules (as well as any agreements with contractors) are kept on file at the facility.
