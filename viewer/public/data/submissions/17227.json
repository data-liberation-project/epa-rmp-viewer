The refinery stores and uses a variety of flammable substances most of which are in the form of mixtures that are termed \"feed stocks\".  Storage of the pure flammables (i.e., propane, butane, 1,3 - butadiene) takes place in the tank farm areas.  In addition, the refinery uses chlorine, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen chloride in a variety of processes.  The following is a list of chemicals or mixtures of chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our accidental release prevention programs, designed control systems and our emergency contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage those hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use or processing of these chemicals.  \n  \n\nRMP Listed Flammable Hydrocarbon Inventory\n\nUnit / Process\nProcess Equipment\n"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Training\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC - Norco Refining Company has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New  employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skills, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Operator re-qualification and re-certification takes place every six months and three years respectively.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n Contractors\nThe MOTIVA ENTERPRISES LLC - Norco Refining Company uses contractors to supplement its workforce during     periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
