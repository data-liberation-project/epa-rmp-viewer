Facility Overview: The AGRO-Nashville facility is a refrigerated warehousing operation providing cold storage rental space to numerous clients with various refrigerated products. The facility is regulated under Risk Management Program (RMP) due to onsite anhydrous ammonia storage in excess of the 10,000 pounds RMP applicability threshold. The facility's only RMP covered process is the ammonia refrigeration system used to refrigerate various areas of the facility.\n\n\n\n?<    * July of 2007 - NRS constructed an entirely separate process (Engine Room 2) containing 5,400 Lbs. of the regulated substance Anhydrous Ammonia. NRS did not report this addition due to the fact it is below the 10,000 pounds threshold. \n\n?<    * November of 2014 - Nashville Refrigeration Services (NRS) was acquired by AGRO\n\n?<    * March of 2015 - AGRO completed the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAGRO decided to include the combination of both Engine Room 1 (ER-1),and Engine Room (ER-2) in this resubmission that totals 18,400 pounds of NH3.\n\n\n\nB. Chemical Safety Overview: The facility overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing Tennessee Occupational Health and Safety Administration (TOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program as specified by 29 CFR 1910.119 already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for ammonia in response to the RMP requirements. The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's PSM and RMP programs and incudes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (i.e. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance for ammonia).\n\n\n\nC. Five-Year Accidental History: The facility has had TWO (2) RMP reportable accidents/releases of ammonia within the past five years. In that same year period, there have been no near miss situations.\n\n\n\nD. Prevention Program: The fa"

      "SummaryText": "cility has implemented a Program 3 level prevention program, as required by the RMP rules, in accordance with US EPA, OSHA PSM, IIAR, and vendor guidance for ammonia. These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequence of any accidental ammonia releases from the facility and include such measures as a system hazard review, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system and updates, etc. The facility prevention program is an on-going system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility changes and RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nE. Emergency Response Program: The facility has developed an emergency action plan for the potential ammonia release scenarios. This plan includes coordination with the facility local fire department responders and any emergency response activities required.\n\n\n\nF. Safety Management and Changes: The facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has an established senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance. This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes, while this manager carries out the mechanics of the RMP requirements; the authority for such activities comes from the CEO of AGRO. To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain /improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP. Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities.\n\n\n\nG. Summary: As documented in this submittal, the RMP for the facility has been completed in accordance with all 40 CFR 68 requirements and the facility has certified compliance.\n\n\n\n"
