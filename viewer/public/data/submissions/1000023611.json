The brewery complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in handling, use and storage of ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals are minimized. Our corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. In support of this policy, process risk reduction programs provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia.\n\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable EHS laws, regulations and permits and to promote a healthful, safe and protected environment.  Each employee is mandated to comply strictly with this policy; neither production goals nor financial objectives shall excuse noncompliance. \n\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to assume a position of leadership in EHS management.  We are committed to the spirit as well as the letter of our EHS policy and promote, throughout the organization, responsibility and accountability for strict compliance with that policy.  Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy.\n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing "

We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers who do so.\nWe encourage our employees, our customers and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.  We maintain dialogue with relevant authorities and local communities concerning EHS incident prevention and preparedness.\n\nAmmonia System\n\nAmmonia is used in the refrigeration system of the brewery.  As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  To ensure our beers maintain the many positive qualities that cold brewing imparts, we refrigerate our beers as part of the production process.  The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped.   Due to the hazards of ammonia, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure, both within the brewery and the surrounding community.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment located within the PSM documentation.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA more realistic alternative release scenario was also modeled. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance. As calculated, the downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment located within the PSM documentation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe brewery has a comprehensive prevention program in place.  This program includes the following elements:\n*  Process hazard analysis and review, including corrective action follow-up requirements;\n*  Standard op"

In fact, the brewery has never had releases with these impacts since it began operation in 1954.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe brewery's emergency response program is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action plans (8 CCR 3220) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain an \"Environmental/Safety Incident Plan\" (ESIP) which has been supplied to, and discussed with, the Los Angeles City Fire Department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the ESIP at the brewery.\n\nBrewery personnel notify local agencies when emergency response is needed. Local agencies determine if the public needs to be notified.
