      "SummaryText": "The Southwest Water Authority (SWA) is a political subdivision of the North Dakota State Water Commission established for the purpose of supplying water to the southwest region of North Dakota. The SWA delivers an estimated 4 million gallons of treated water per day to its customers. This figure continues to rise as the SWA expands and serves a larger area. Because of the amount of chlorine stored and used in the water treatment process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and also at our Dodge Pumping Station (DPS), we as management / operators are requied to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA under 40 CRF Part 68-Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions ruling. The Water Treatment Plant stores up to 4 chlorine containers (8,000 lbs.) at the Dickinson location and may store as much as 3 chlorine containers (6,000 lbs) at the Dodge location. The amount of chlorine used at the WTP is an approximate average of 100 pounds per day and the amount used at the DPSis an approximate average of 50 pounds per day. The SWA is in compliance with the EPA's Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA). Each year since the reporting year of 1992, the WTP has submitted to the state and local emergency response authorities, documentation of the hazardous chemicals used and stored at both our locations. All treatment operators employed with the SWA are trained in chlorine safety and are well versed in the operational aspects of the chlorine or chlorine / ammonia disinfection process. On-going training sessions for chlorine safety as well as other safety training is and will be conducted on a regular basis. All operators engaged in the maintenance of the chlorine process equipment are well informed as to the equipment mechanics, calibration and testing. The RMP is well received and is an important part of the safety program for the SWA. The SWA has a written emergency response plan and the RMP is used in conjunction with this plan. The SWA has an excellent chlorine accident history. Ou"

      "SummaryText": "r records show that there has never been a chlorine related accident involving injury or significant property damage. In coordination with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Dickinson Fire Department will act as the emergency response team for the WTP. In coordination with the Dunn County LEPC, the Halliday District Fire Department will act as the emergency response team for the DPS. In the event of a chlorine detection, via chlorine gas monitors and computer telemetry, the WTP operators will respond to the alarm in accordance with our RMP."
