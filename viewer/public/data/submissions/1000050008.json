Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service, Mankato, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substances Handled: \r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and handled for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. The facility now has 1-45,000 gallon storage tank; and additional available capacity of approximately 20,000 gallons in nurse tanks when the nurse tanks are on site during the spring planting and fall harvest seasons. The maximum quantity handled would be a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture Rules and Regulations, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility equipment was recently installed by an outside contractor who worked with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to ensure full compliance of all rules and regulations.  Internal semi-annual inspections of all bulk and nurse tank equipment will be conducted, including inspection of load and unload equipment, with any needed maintenance being done as part of those inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the"
