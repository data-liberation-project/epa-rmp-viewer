(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK\u00c2\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Ulysses Truck Terminal is owned and operated by ONEOK NGL Pipeline, L.L.C.  At the facility, demethanized product is received via trucks and injected into a pipeline to be sent out to gas liquids fractionators for further processing.  There are two 30,000-gallon storage vessels at the facility containing demethanized product.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances contained in the demethanized product are ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane.  These are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  There are no RMP toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Grant County Sheriff and the Kansas Department of Public Safety.  The Area Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.
