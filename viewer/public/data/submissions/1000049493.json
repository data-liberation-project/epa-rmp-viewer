              "Description": "ammonia refrigeration system\n\n\n\nAmericold Logistics Services\n\nPrevention Program Description\n\n\n\nThe Americold logistics Services Prevention Program is built on the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard for ammonia refrigeration systems. The first element in the safe function of ammonia refrigeration equipment is in the design itself. All components in the system were designed and installed in compliance with ANSI, ASHRAE, ASME, pressure vessel codes and all other applicable design safety standards in effect at the time of construction. In order for this system to function safely and effectively over a long period of time, it must be properly maintained and monitored for system integrity and functional efficiency. Maintenance and monitoring is accomplished by employees trained to follow safe procedures when operating the equipment from normal start up to running and emergency shut down. Also built into the system are automated and manual safeguards that monitor and maintain pressures, temperatures, liquid levels and warning systems that alert operators to respond early to operational deviations before they become emergencies.\n\n\n\nOperator training also includes participation in hazard analysis studies and emergency response procedures that permit hands-on practice in the use of personal protective equipment in an emergency scenario. The hazard analysis (what-if) checklist helps operators and emergency responders understand how to evaluate and manage an emergency situation safely and effectively in order to mitigate the potential releases. Lockout/tagout and the line opening procedures are very important for preventing further hazards around malfunctioning equipment or when making even minor repairs on the system.\n\n\n\nGeneral employee training involves knowledge of ammonia hazards, warning system and evacuation procedures. Coordinated emergency response planning is established with the Brown County LEPC and a written offsite emergency response plan is reviewed annually. \n\n",

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nAmeriCold Logistics maintains a (safety) committee whose members are the\n\ndesignated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the action organization and\n\nnotification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be\n\nimplemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is\n\nreviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance\n\nwith the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Americold Green Bay facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold\n\nstorage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia\n\nthrough various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure\n\nvapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in\n\npressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers\n\nits temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat from a\n\nroom or product. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to\n\nvaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.
