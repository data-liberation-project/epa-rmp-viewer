Additionally, CF Industries' Ritzville Terminal has had no releases in the last five years that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCF Industries will continue to coordinate information and training with emergency responders.  This information-sharing will occur during face-to-face discussions and emergency response drills.\n\nCF Industries will continue its long standing policy to host Community Interface Meetings for the first responders, government officials, businesses and neighbors.  During these meetings, the attendees receive a tour of the facility and receive information about CF Industries and its accident prevention programs.  Following the presentation, the facilities' employees are available to answer questions.\n\nIn addition, as part of the Company's Community Giving Program, CF Industries provides financial assistance to enhance public safety in the community.  CF Industries has donated funds that have been used to purchase self-contained breathing apparatus for the Ritzville Fire Department.  Additionally, CF Industries provided funds used to send 2 members of the Ritzville Fire Department to special ammonia suppression training in Holden, Louisiana, conducted by CF Industries and the Louisiana State Police.  This training provides firefighters the opportunity to learn how to protect the public in the unlikely event of an accidental ammonia release.  Also, the Company has supported the local Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund."

      "SummaryText": "al's ability to take protective action.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nIn addition to the worst case scenario, the RMP rule also requires the submittal of an alternative release scenario, or more realistic release scenario for each regulated toxic pollutant.  For the Ritzville Terminal, the alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor from a pressure relief valve on the top of the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The scenario further assumes that the pressure relief valve properly re-seats, as has been shown in practice.  Thus, the release is assumed to occur for one minute.  No active mitigation measures were considered in evaluating a release under this scenario.\n\nThe above-described release was chosen because it represents the most common type of release, as determined from an evaluation of all recent releases from CF Industries Terminals.  CF Industries believes this release represents the most probable type of release which could occur at the Ritzville Terminal, which has off-site impacts to the general public and/or the environment.\n\nUnder average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release will cause off-site impacts.  The EPA's RMP*Comp program, Version 1.06, was used to perform the off-site consequence analysis.  The ammonia toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L was used in the assessment.\n\nThe alternative scenario for ammonia solutions was defined as a truck pull-away from a loading arm.  The flow of ammonia is assumed to be stopped within 2 minutes.  The pooled ammonia solution will vaporize from the operational containment area.  Under average weather conditions of low/moderate wind speed and neutral atmospheric dispersion, the release could cause off-site impacts to the public and/or the environment.

      "SummaryText": "impact.\n7  Critical operating conditions at the Ritzville Terminal are monitored through two independent sets of instrumentation.  Pressure and level gauges alert Terminal personnel with alarms and automatic shutdowns.\n7  A flare, activated automatically, helps control tank pressure by burning ammonia vapor before it can be released to the atmosphere.  This is performed when the ammonia compressors are unable to maintain the tank pressure.\n7  The ammonia tank system is protected by pressure/vacuum relief valves and compressors which operate automatically.\n7  Emergency shutdown buttons are located throughout the facility.  These buttons can be used by anyone to shutdown the product flows in the event of an emergency.\n7  CF Industries has instituted a comprehensive tank inspection program that requires every tank be inspected at fifteen year intervals.  Tanks are emptied and subjected to a series of tests.  This program is designed to identify and correct any tank problems.  A tank outage typically lasts three months and costs the Company $300,000.  Although an inspection is costly in terms of money and distribution logistics, CF Industries believes the safety benefits far outweigh the costs.\n7  Through CF Industries' PSM program, all covered equipment used at the facility undergoes routine performance tests and maintenance.  This PSM program forms the foundation for the RMP prevention program.\n7  The Ritzville Terminal is staffed around-the-clock.  Thus, operating temperatures and pressures, and other parameters, are monitored 24 hours a day.  Such monitoring allows Terminal personnel to quickly respond to operational problems in their early stage; thereby preventing releases of ammonia to the environment.\n7  Every truck which enters or leaves the facility with anhydrous ammonia is inspected by facility personnel.  Each truck is checked for leaks, and surveillance cameras provide operating personnel additional views of truck loading conditions.  Any truck that fails"

Every operating person receives extensive Hazardous Materials Safety training with eight hours of refresher training each year.  They also receive documented training covering 49 specific topics.\n7  The Ritzville facility maintains industrial hygiene and medical programs that meet or exceed standards of good professional practice.\n7  CF Industries also works extensively with the local emergency  and fire responders through simulation training and drills.  The Company believes it is important that first responders are prepared to deal with any emergency on site.\n7  CF Industries routinely carries out highly documented maintenance checks on its process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n7  CF Industries maintains and enforces formal procedures and policies on environmental protection, safety awareness, facility design and operation, and contractor compliance that, in many cases, go beyond legal and regulatory requirements.  The Company's internal EHS audit program is designed to make the Ritzville Terminal the best in the industry.  In addition, the Terminal maintains written operating procedures which describe what tasks a process operator must perform, define safe operating parameters that must be maintained, and set safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.

The Manual includes all aspects of emergency response including personnel roles and responsibilities, lines of authority, communication, pre-emergency planning, emergency recognition and prevention, emergency alerting and response procedures, site evacuation routes, site security, decontamination, emergency response equipment, medical treatment and first aid services, and post-emergency activities and training.  The Manual is reviewed annually with the first responders.  In addition, CF Industries trains its employees annually on the use of this Manual.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for the Ritzville Terminal was calculated using the methodology included in the EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Guidance.  This methodology was applied to the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia storage tank, an ammonia solutions tank, and a pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  Applying the RMP's mandated assumptions, the pressurized storage tank resulted in the largest downwind impact.  Thus, the worst case release scenario, which is highly unlikely, involves a complete release of the volume of the pressurized anhydrous ammonia storage tank to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  Under the worst case weather conditions of low wind speed and minimal atmospheric dispersion, off-site impacts will occur.  The EPA's RMP*Comp program, Version 1.06, was used to determine the maximum downwind distance the ammonia release could impact the general public and/or the environment.  This assessment incorporated a toxic endpoint (ammonia concentration) of 0.14 mg/L.  This toxic endpoint refers to the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individu"
