It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \u00bfdump box\u00bf contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the facility is treated as a single process.\n3.\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 13,200 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.  Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  \n\nWe inform our employees of the"

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSunmet Packing and Cold Storage has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n5.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \u00bfEmergency Action Plans.\u00bf  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u00bf and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond \u00bfminimally\u00bf to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Kern County Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n6.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage business practices rather than the order presented in the law.

Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00bfliving document\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Sunmet Packing and Cold Storage will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."

Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Four (4) rooms are designated as \u00bfprecooling\u00bf rooms, while three (3) others are cold storage rooms.  The precooling rooms are equipped with \u00bfbunker style\u00bf evaporator coils and the storage rooms are equipped with ceiling suspended coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.   A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nThe storage rooms utilize a pumped liquid recirculator system wher"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to two reciprocating and two screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquified and returned to the high pressure receiver. Some of the high pressure liquid from the receivers is injected into the oil cooler on the screw compressor.  Excess liquid from the liquid recirculator is pumped to a tranfer vessel where the liquid tranfers into the high pressue receiver by gravity.  The system uses hot ammonia gas to defrost the coils.  A portion of the high pressure discharge from the compressors is piped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve and into the coil.  There are two high pressure receivers, however, they are piped together so that they act in concert.   \n\nThe precooler rooms utilize a gravity flooded system where high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to the precooler rooms, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessels mounted behind the bunker wall.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the bunker coils coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the gas to the compressors in the engine room.\n\nT"
