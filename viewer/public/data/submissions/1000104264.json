Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service, Truman, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility involves the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately one 45,000 and one 26,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 31,900 pounds available capacity in various 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n3.
