Two scenarios are considered in this plan.  The first scenario considered is the full release of the contents from one 2000 pound vessel of chlorine in a ten minute time period.  The second scenario considered is the more likely release scenario for a release of chlorine from the waste water treatment plant.  This scenario assumes that a hose leaks chlorine at a rate of 2.2 pounds per minute for a five minute period.  This rate is realistic for the 0.25 inch hoses used and given the chlorine detectors in the chlorine building would alert employees to a release who would then take corrective actions.\n1.4.

Emergency Response Program\nThe City of Grand Rapids Public Utilities has prepared an Emergency Response Plan that is designed for timely, safe, and efficient response actions to minimize hazards t human health and safety, the environment, and property in situations involving releases of chlorine from the covered process at the waste water treatment plant.  This plan is reviewed periodically to ensure that the information is accurate.  Local response authorities have been provided a copy of the plan in the event that they would be required to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n1.7. Safety Improvements Planned\nDuring the safety inspection performed as part of the Process Safety management Plan preparation, several action items were identified to improve the safety and accurate tracking of chlorine at the waste water treatment plant.  Action items identified include but were not limited to proper movement and adjustment of the chlorine cylinders, maintenance procedures for equipment, proper operating limits of control systems, use of personal protective equipment by employees, and non-destructive testing of pipeline.  Each of these items are the responsibility of the Waste Water Treatment Plant Manager to ensure that they are addressed and procedures revised when appropriate."
