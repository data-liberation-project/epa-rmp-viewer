Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the FVA WTP RMP for the chlorine system.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the FVA WTP) and actively participated in a comprehensive hazard review.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this w"

This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the FVA WTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, Colorado Springs Utilities has established and maintains emergency procedures.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe FVA WTP is located at 13202 Dellacroce Drive near Fountain, El Paso County, Colorado.  The FVA WTP takes Fry-Ark water from the Pueblo Reservoir and through a series of pump stations to the treatment plant, where the water is treated through coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection.  Chlorine is added to the raw water before coagulation, before filtration, and as the water leaves the plant for storage in the finished tank.\n\nThe plant treats six to eighteen million gallons per day (MGD), depending on the time of year.  The design treatment capacity of the FVA WTP is 18 MGD, which is expected to be the average daily treatment rate in 2006.  From the plant, the treated water is pumped to five different entities for public consumption.  Up to 104,000 households or a population of 250,000 over a 60 square mile area can receive water from the FVA WTP.\n\nThe FVA WTP utilizes chlorine as a disinfecting agent in the treatment of drinking water and is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the FVA WTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\u00b7 Safety information, which includes information pertaining to t"

In the event of a release of chlorine in the storage room, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the chlorine-contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility is included in the Colorado Springs LEPC emergency response program.  In addition, Fountain Valley Authority WTP has established and maintains emergency procedures, which includes an evacuation and notification plan.

Colorado Springs Utilities works closely with the Colorado Springs LEPC and other local industries and agencies to coordinate local response activities.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the FVA WTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
