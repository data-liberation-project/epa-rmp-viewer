      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report contains the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Good Humor-Breyers Ice Cream facility in Sikeston, MO North.  The RMP was prepared by Primatech in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk  Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe information presented in this report reflects the data element requirements and numbering sequence of the final EPA RMP submission.  \n\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGood Humor - Breyers recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Sikeston, MO North facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program and a Plant Safety Team.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to:  achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated which damage of property, and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Engineering Services Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe ammonia related incident involving contractor injury was identified for the Sikeston North facility in the previous five years.  On March 14, 1998, approximately 0.05 pounds of gaseous ammonia was released over a 10 second period.  The incident involved construction contractor error while operating ammonia lines.  One contractor employee received medical treatment from a physician and was thereafter released.  The incident did not result in property damage or offsite impacts.  As a result of this incident, lockout/tagout procedures and construction supervision practices were enhanced to prevent a similar incident from reoccurring.\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Sikeston, MO North facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. \n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n\nOrganization Plan and Responsibilities \nCommunications Procedures \nDetailed Action Plans\nFirst Aid Procedures \nEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures\nEvacuation Plans\nDescription of Outside Assistance Available\nSite Re-Entry Procedures \nTraining Programs and Drills\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Sikeston MO North facility is a fairly new facility incorporated with numerous beneficial design features that allow for maximized safety and operating conditions.  Therefore, at present, no major changes have been planned to further im"

      "SummaryText": "prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nGood Humor - Breyers operates an ice cream production facility in Sikeston, MO North.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CSAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is 76,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC. Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Sikeston, MO North facility involves the release of  ammonia over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the intercooler vessel.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as the vessel is never completely full during normal operating conditions. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  \n\n7 The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n7 Industry standa"

      "SummaryText": "rds were followed for the manufacturer and quality control of the intercooler;\n7 The distances did not take into account the low pressure characteristics of the intercooler, which would result in a less severe release;\n7 Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessel is relatively new;\n7 Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the intercooler;\n7 The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels;\n7 The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n7 The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\nThe alternative releases scenario at the Sikeston, MO North facility involves the release of 3,070 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the rupture of a = liquid pipe feeding the ice cream freezers. The scenario has been developed based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlike for the following reasons:\n\n7 Most of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\n7 Industry standards were followed for the manufacturer and quality control of the high pressure liquid lines;\n7 Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n7 Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from forklifts;\n7 The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the system;\n7 The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n7 The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing isolation valves in the liquid lines.\n\nD. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements"
