Two buildings are located on-site.  One is a one-story brick building which houses offices, the processing areas, shipping/receiving and raw material and finished product storage functions.  The second building is a one-story metal warehouse used for storage of dry goods and empty cardboard containers.\n\nThe Ronson (processing area) facility is comprised of the following:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMulti-Lube product line\n\u00c2\u00bf\tKleenol product line\n\u00c2\u00bf\tRonsonol product line\n\u00c2\u00bf\tQuality Control\n\u00c2\u00bf\tQuality Assurance\n\nRonson Corporation operations include the filling and blending of specific materials into final products.  These final products are then dispensed into containers through fill lines, with the containerized materials being sold as consumer commodities. \n\nMulti-Lube\nMulti-Lube filling operations are conducted in the Fill Room.  Multi-Lube is a mixture of a Mineral spirits (5,000 gallon tank), fragrance (5 gallon pail), Oils and Alox (55 gallon drum).   Mineral spirits are fed through a feed tube into a 2,000 gallon mix tank and mixed with Oils/Alox, which are pneumatically fed.  Containment and control systems have been installed to minimize overflow and recover multi-lube and re-circulate back to the mix tank for re-use.\n\nKleenol\nKleenol filling operations are conducted in the Fill Room.  Kleenol is a mixture of a Mineral spirits (5,000 gallon tank), fragrance (5 gallon pail), Isopropyl Alcohol (55 gallon drum), Glycol Ether (55 gallon drum), Surfactants (55 gallon drum) and water.
