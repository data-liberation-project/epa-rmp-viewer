      "SummaryText": "-- ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRalphs Grocery Company in Riverside, CA is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we have coordinated with the City of Riverside Fire Department and the Riverside County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n-- THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  There are two operating divisions located at the Ralphs Riverside complex that each utilize an independent ammonia refrigeration system for cold storage, and the production of dairy products.  These two separate operating divisions are the Distribution Center, and the Creamery.  Both ammonia refrigeration systems employed by Ralphs Riverside maintain an ammonia inventory that exceeds the RMP threshold for ammonia of 10,000 pounds, which means that both divisions implement the requirements of the RMP and Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM).\n\n\n\n-- THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRalphs Grocery Riverside has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. To meet these necessary requirements Ralphs Grocery Riverside has implemented the Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the Cal-OSHA PSM Standard, CCR Title 8, Section 5189.\n\n\n\nBoth operating divisions located at the Ralphs Riverside complex (Distrib"

This includes the on-site emergency response team that conducts joint exercises, training, and pre-planning meetings.\n\n\n\n-- ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn ammonia related incident occurred at the Ralphs Grocery Riverside facility on 5/24/2009. This accidental release did not result in any on or off-site property damage or injuries.  It also did not exceed the federal reportable threshold of 100 pounds.\n\n\n\n-- EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nOur facility has an in-house first responder team that is trained to handle chemical releases and works in cooperation with the City of Riverside Fire Department. Training on emergency response procedures and policies is provided to operating engineers at both the Distribution Center and the Creamery upon hiring, with refresher courses provided regularly (minimum annually).  The facility maintains a mobile emergency command center that can be used to assist with catastrophic scenarios.  A trailer with personal protective equipment (PPE) including Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA's) is also located on site and is regularly maintained by the emergency response team members.  In the event emergency health services are required, trained responders are equipped with basic first aid knowledge and will assist the Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services personnel.  Both operating divisions at the Ralphs Riverside complex also conduct routine evacuation drills so that employe"

Compliance Audits are also conducted at least every three years to ensure each element of the RMP and PSM programs are being properly implemented including: training, preventative maintenance, emergency planning and response, and operating procedures.  Routine PSM/RMP Committee meetings are also held at both operating divisions during which any outstanding action items are reviewed and delegated, and any upcoming or new issues are recorded to ensure that they are resolved and documented.  Ralphs Grocery Riverside personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes.\n\n"
