Cambrex Charles City (CCC) maintains administrative offices, research &      development and manufacturing facilities in Charles City, Iowa and markets products globally.\n\nDr. Joseph Salsbury, a veterinarian, founded Dr. Salsbury's Laboratories in 1929.  Salsbury remained family          owned until     Solvay and Cie, a Belgium company, purchased it in 1979.  The name was changed to Solvay Animal     Health, Inc. (SAH) in  1987.  In 1991, Cambrex Corporation acquired the chemical production assets from SAH.  The division was renamed   Salsbury  Chemicals, Inc. in 1991 and renamed Cambrex Charles City, Inc in 2002, and remains a wholly owned subsidiary of    Cambrex Corporation.\n\nCCC is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment.  As a     part of this   commitment, CCC has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the Charles City Plant. One    part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage risks at the Charles City Plant and     that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's  (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk   management plan describing the risk management program at the Charles City     Plant.

In the event of a significant accidental release, CCC evacuates workers and contacts the local fire and police departments to control and contain the release and to prevent    and/or reduce the consequences of the release.\n \nCCC's commitment is manifested further in our use of sound operating and maintenance practices, use of safety-conscious designs as well as extensive employee training.  In addition, we perform periodic safety audits and investigate all incidents and integrate lessons learned into our operations to further minimize risks to employees,    the environment, and the community.\n\nCCC operates its plant in an environment that promotes safety, shows respect for employees, encourages       individual development and supports teamwork to achieve common goals. We know that the ongoing health and safety of  our     employees and environmental compliance is critical to our success.  Thus, CCC manages our business     in a manner     conscious of current and future environmental needs so that we are an asset to our community     through our business  practices and local involvement.\n\nWe continuously improve our practices in light of advances in technology and new understandings in safety,    health, and environmental science.

These management practices involve extensive employee training, process   hazard analysis, written operating and maintenance procedures, safe work practices, management of change,       incident investigation, and periodic audits.\n\nEmployee Health and Safety Code\nOur overall injury rates are consistently well below the average rates for similar-sized companies in the chemical industry.  CCC's average OSHA Incident Rate for the past five years is 1.7.\n\nPollution Prevention Code\nCCC maintains a system to establish specific process and facility-wide waste reduction and pollution prevention goals and to track our progress in meeting these goals.

In order to manufacture a range of      bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients, CCC stores and handles one RMP-regulated substance in an RMP-covered      process.  Polyallylamine hydrochloride was first manufactured at Salsbury in July 1997.  However, increased     product demands have caused us to employ this process at greater production rates, which requires that we store the RMP-regulated substance, allylamine, on site in an amount that exceeds EPA's RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  We store about 43,000 lbs.     Of allylamine, a toxic and flammable substance, in a 7,500     gal. bulk storage tank at atmospheric pressure. The bulk storage tank and associated process equipment has a maximum intended inventory of 60,000 lbs and is regulated as a single EPA     RMP Program 3 process.\n\n1.3  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCCC maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and to ensure safe operation:\n\nProcess Safety Information - CCC maintains up-to-date, easily accessible versions of a variety of important chemical process information concerning chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment so that our employees can effectively perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - CCC performs team-based hazard analyses on the allylamine process using industry best-practice methods.  A management safety committee evaluates the results and resolves and implements     safety improvements on a timely basis.  CCC updates its hazard analysis when significant process changes warrant,     but no less often than every five years.\n\nOperating Procedures - We maintain written operating procedures for our employees to use and we"

No releases of allylamine have     occurred from the Charles City Plant in the past five years that have resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program\n\nCCC coordinates emergency response procedures with the Charles City Fire Department and with the North     Central Regional Emergency Planning District.  CCC plant employees receive significant training to respond to   minor spill events that do not have a potential for significant effects (e.g., small leaks).  In the event of a larger release, workers evacuate the area and contact the fire department and other local and regional emergency response    officials.\n\n1.6  Planned Changes to I"
