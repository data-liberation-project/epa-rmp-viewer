It strives to maintain a safe workplace.  Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan for prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The activity of this company is the retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as fertilizer for crop production.\n\nOur plant consists of two-18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks, which, when filled at 85%, amounts to 158,000 lbs. and 12 nurse trailers, each holding approximately 4,400 pounds, which, when filled to 85%, amounts to 52,800 lbs.  The maximum quantity stored at this facility (filled at 85%) is 210,800 lbs.\n\n  The worse case release scenario would be a release of 79,000 pounds (  One  18,000 gallon tank) of NH3, over a ten minute period and has the potential to affect a total of nearly 700 people.  Distance to end point in worse case scenario would be 1.89 miles from our plant.  The alternative release would be a 11,908 lbs. release (transfer hose failure) in approximately 2 minutes.  This release scenario would have a distance to endpoint of .83 of a mile, still affecting the same 700 residents.  Our public receptors would include schools, residences, a hospital, and a public park.\n\nOur plant is operated and maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are trained, at a state school every three years and company wide on a yearly basis, on the proper procedures to operate the plant, as well as the procedures to fill a nurse tank.  Our workers always have fresh safety water on hand and wear the proper personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during ammonia operations.\n\nFarmers Grain & Supply Company in Ashland is proud to report that there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years resu"
