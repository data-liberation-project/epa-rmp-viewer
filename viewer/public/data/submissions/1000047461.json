      "SummaryText": "The City of Bartlesville in conjunction with Veolia Water North America Operating Services, operates the Chickasaw Wastewater Treatment Plant which is located on the north side of town within the City limits. The Facility utilizes chlorine to disinfect the final effluent prior to its discharge to the Caney River.\n\nThe Chickasaw Wastewater Treatment Plant views Safety as its principle priority, especially as it pertains to chlorine. The maximum on-site chlorine inventory is 3 tons (6,000 lbs.) and the Facility limits the number of in-service cylinder connections to two (4,000 lbs). Administrative controls dictate that only one chlorine cylinder valve and its respective distribution header piping valve are to be open at any time.  \n\nThe worst case scenario for the Chickasaw Wastewater Plant would be release from a one ton (2,000) chlorine cylinder resulting in an estimated Level of Concern [LOC] of .9 miles using the Landview 5 and RMPCOMP mapping program. \n\nThe first alternate scenario represents the severing of a transfer hose [whip] connection between the cylinder and the distribution header pipe. This has an estimated LOC of 0.1 miles and a release of approximately 450 pounds. This alternate is the release scenario that is most likely to occur. \n\nThe Chickasaw Wastewater Plant follows a strict operation, safety and maintenance regimen to minimize the likelihood of a chlorine release at the Facility. Due to the rigid implementation of the above-mentioned programs, this Facility has not had a release within the last five years.\n\nThe Chickasaw Wastewater Plant presents training and refresher courses for the personnel at the Facility pertaining to the potential health hazards, proper use of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), minor leak repair, and the operation and maintenance of all components which comprise the chlorine feed system. Regardless of how slight, were an accident to occur, the Local Emergency Planning Commission [LEPC] and the Bartlesville Fire D"
