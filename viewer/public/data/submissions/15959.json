Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies \n\nWe at East Moline Water Filtration Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our  trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Rock Island County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 12000 lbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the CompuTerra Co. software program wich in turn used look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-case analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from chlorination.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to endpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a residential population of 126384 within this distance.\n\nToxic Alternative-case analyses\n\nThe Alternative Case"
