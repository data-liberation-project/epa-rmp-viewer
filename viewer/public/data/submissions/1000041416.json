In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\n\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Dannon Company facility is located at 216 Southgate Drive, Minster, Ohio. We manufacture some of the finest cultured dairy products (yogurt) in the world. The facility covers approximately 450,000 square feet and includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, two ammonia refrigeration engine rooms, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Also located at the facility, a raw milk processing plant, shipping and receiving docks. \n\n\n\nThe facility has 2 separate ammonia systems and produces and shipped approximately 702 million pounds of finished product in 2013.  The refrigeration systems exceed the 10,000 pound threshold required for our production process and necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nThe Dannon Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.
