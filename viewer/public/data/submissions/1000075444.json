Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nTo perform the PHAs, Bluebonnet Water Supply Corporation Water Treatment Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team. Responsibility to resolve\n\nthe recommendations is assigned to the Treatment Plant Operations Supervisor and is tracked through completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Bluebonnet Water Supply Corporation Water Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.
