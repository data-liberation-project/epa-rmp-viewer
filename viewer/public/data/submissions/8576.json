Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ..\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nWillow Island's Polymer Additives Department produces thiodipropionitrile which is used to make antioxidants which are used in such products as polyolefins.\nThe regulated substance involved with this batch process is acrylonitrile.\n\nThe Polymer Additives Department also produces A-1846 which is used to make antioxidants for use in such products as SPANDEX b.  The regulated substance involved with this batch process is 37% hydrochloric acid.\n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 80,000 pounds of acrylonitrile.  The mitigating effect of a dike was included in the evaluation of the possible consequences. The evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is the overflow of a storage tank due to operator error and the release of 1,250 pounds of material.  The mitigating effects of a dike, the fire brigade response and the use of a foam application system were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n  \nThe alternative release scenario for 37% hydrochloric acid is the overflow of a storage tank d"
