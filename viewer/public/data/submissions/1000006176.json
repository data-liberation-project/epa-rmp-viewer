Chlorine is stored as a liquefied compressed gas in typical one-ton containers at the Carlsbad MWD stations.  Two chlorine systems are situated on the Carlsbad MWD site: Lower Maerkle, and Upper Maerkle.  As stated on their website, \"Public Works is responsible for a variety of behind the scenes services that keep our city running smoothly. We are \"At Your Service\" and committed to providing top quality service to the Carlsbad community.\"\n\nCarlsbad MWD's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The Water Operations Superintendent is responsible for various inspections of the City's facilities to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nCarlsbad MWD maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  Carlsbad MWD also has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ens"

      "SummaryText": "ure that the plan is kept current.\n\nCarlsbad MWD has formal and informal facility training programs for all employees.  Hazardous Materials training, (Awareness Level, 8-Hour HAZWOPER), is given to operators at the district.  These operators are allowed to go onsite and assess the release from outside.  All employees receive generalized training during new employee orientation.  The level of additional training may vary depending upon the department to which an employee is assigned.  Operators are trained to call for outside assistance (911 and/or San Diego HazMat) to respond to a chlorine release.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Carlsbad Municipal Water District Maerkle Dam facility (5203 Sunny Creek Road, Carlsbad, California) is owned and operated by CMWD (5950 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, California).  The facility is located approximately 1 mile North of the intersection of El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road.  The area surrounding the facility consists of the Maerkle reservoir, agricultural land, and a new residential development to the North.  Two very similar chlorine water treatment systems reside on the property: Lower Maerkle and Upper Maerkle.  The chlorine systems were constructed in 1995 accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  Each process is located within a separate chain link fenced area with access through one gate only.\n\nThe Maerkle Facility is a 111 acre site that consists of a ten million gallon distribution reservoir, a 600 acre foot long-term storage impound, one pumping/disinfection facility (Lower Maerkle), one impound disinfection facility (Upper Maerkle), related pressure control stations, meter stations, and a caretaker's residence.  The site is normally unmanned (with the exception of the caretaker's residence).  Operators visit the site daily to ensure that the chlorine systems are operational.\n\n*  Lower Maerkle Chlorine System\n\nA maximum of 5 one-ton containers (10,000 pounds) of chlorine"

      "SummaryText": " can be stored in the chlorine room at any one time.  \n\nChlorine gas is drawn from one of the two on-line one-ton containers through an automatic switch over/vacuum regulator.  Automatic switch over regulator valves control which container is actively feeding chlorine to the vacuum regulator.  The other containers are either empty or in standby status.\n\nDownstream of the vacuum regulator, chlorine is fed to a combination of six manually-adjustable chlorinators located in an adjacent room.  The chlorine can be distributed to four independently-controlled processes: System 20, System 25, System 30, and System 40.  Each process feeds chlorine gas into solution at an injector where it is mixed with water.  System 20 is flow paced only -- the chlorine feed rate is manually controlled at the rotameter.  The other three systems are compound loop systems -- the chlorine feed rate is controlled by a combination of manual adjustment at the rotameter and residual chlorine concentration.\n\nThe one-ton containers are stored in the chlorine tank room, which is protected by a scrubber with a capacity of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  The scrubber is activated based on the alarm status of two chlorine leak detectors located in the chlorine room (1) and in the chlorinator room (1).  A detection of 1 part per million (ppm) activates on-site alarms and sends a call through the SCADA system to the duty operator's phone.  A detection of 3 ppm triggers the halogen valves to automatically shut off the chlorine ton feed valves that operate on a motor to physically close the one-ton container valve, initiates operation of the chlorine scrubber, the SCADA system sends another call to the duty operator's phone stating that the halogen valve is closed. \n\nA scale that indicates the remaining weight of chlorine in each of the on-line one-ton containers allows system operators to plan ahead for placing chemical supply orders for delivery.  A monorail hoist is used to change out the chlorine cylinders."

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe chlorine system is operated entirely under vacuum conditions.  Carlsbad MWD has removed all pressurized piping by attaching a vacuum regulator to each of the one-ton container valves.  The containers are positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The flex tubing is connected to the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas (not liquid) is drawn out of the container.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line downstream of the vacuum regulator, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping from the line under vacuum.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum (downstream of the vacuum leak) will be drawn to the injection point and into solution.\n\n*  Upper Maerkle Chlorine System\n\nThe design and operation of the chlorine system (upstream of the chlorinators) at the Upper Maerkle facility is essentially identical to that of the lower station.  Only two chlorinators are used at the Upper facility.  Prior to injection, the chlorine gas passes through a chlorine dioxide generator that used sodium hypochlorite as a reagent to create chlorine dioxide.  The process feeds this chlorine dioxide into solution at the injector where it is mixed with water.  Similar chlorine detection and scrubber systems are located at the Upper facility.  The maximum quantity of chlorine maintained for the Upper Maerkle process is 2 one-ton containers (4,000 pounds).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Carlsbad MWD chlorine systems have many safety features.  Much of the systems' safety is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern their operation.  For example, the Carlsbad MWD treatment processes operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nIn the event th"

      "SummaryText": "at the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are four mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine gas detectors, 2) visual/audible alarms, 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system, and 4) halogen valves.  In case of chlorine detection (1 ppm), the chlorine gas detectors, which are strategically located in the chlorine buildings (tank and chlorinator rooms), trigger audible alarms on-site and sends a call through the SCADA system to the duty operator's phone.  Should the chlorine concentration reach 3 ppm, the detectors will activate the visual alarm, triggers the halogen valves to automatically shut off the valves that operate on a motor to physically close the one-ton container valve, initiates operation of the chlorine scrubber, and the SCADA system sends another call to the duty operatorAAA?s phone stating that the halogen valve is closed.  The scrubber has the capability of neutralizing 2,000 pounds of chlorine with a 99%+ rate of effectiveness.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, vacuum regulators prevent chlorine from escaping the system.  A backup generator that is activated during a power outage is maintained on site to power the chlorine systems.  If vacuum conditions are compromised, the vacuum regulators close stopping chlorine flow from the one-ton containers.  Chlorine vent lines are piped to ventilation intakes of the scrubber system.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases of chlorine at the Upper and Lower Maerkle Dam Stations of the Carlsbad MWD over the past five years (May 2004 -- May 2009), that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 10 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release o"

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCarlsbad MWD has an emergency plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCarlsbad MWD has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Carlsbad  Fire Department.  Since the facility is normally unmanned, chlorine operators are typically the only personnel on site.  In case chlorine leak detection at the facility, the on-call (\"duty\") operator is alerted via SCADA system to operator's phone.  The duty operator alerts the MWD Supervisor and immediately responds to the alarm.  Upon arrival, the Supervisor will determine whether or not the Fire Department is to be called to respond to the emergency based on the severity of the incident.  The duty operator assignment is made on a rotating basis between the 5 chlorine systems operators.  Each chlorine operator has the necessary hazardous materials training to be considered \"qualified\" to assess the severity of a chlorine leak.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalida"
