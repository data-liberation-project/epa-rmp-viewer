Curren Advance Wastewater Treatment (HFC AWTP) uses both chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the wastewater treatment process.  The stored volume of these chemicals is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) threshold for requiring the establishment and submittal of a risk management plan.  This plan along with other safety precautions is intended to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of maintenance and operation workers, as well as co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of the HFC AWTP to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  The HFC AWTP uses several safety measures regarding the storage, handling and use of these chemicals including devices inherent in the design of the plant facilities, safe handling procedures, and extensive training of personnel.\n\nThe HFC AWTP's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The HFC AWTP adheres to all applicable procedures of the USEPA Prevention Program.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\n-    The regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\n-    The primary purpose of this facility is to treat the wastewater from the City of Tampa Service Area.
