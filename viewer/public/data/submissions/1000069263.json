The RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, and Emergency Response.  Equipment included under this covered process is a single 16,700-gallon stationary storage tank and ancillary piping and valves.\n\n\n\nHelena receives aqueous ammonia by a vendor that transports the aqueous ammonia with a commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the aqueous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The Contractor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation. At a minimum, the Contractor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its? OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Contractor.\n\n",

Making connection to the railcar and transferring the anhydrous ammonia from the railcar to the MPR is performed by Independent Fertilizer Contractor (i.e. Owner/Operator of the MPR). Helena does not own or operate the railcar. The anhydrous ammonia vendor is responsible to Helena and the Department of Transportation (DOT) for providing railcars that meet DOT standards.

The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Pasco, WA Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Pasco, WA Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this to reflect a change in the Program Level (i.e. 2 to 3).  The Facility is planning to resume the blending of Ammonium Polyphosphate (APP) Fertilizer which involves bringing anhydrous ammonia in by railcar and a Mobile Pipe Reacting (MPR) Contractor in to perform the APP fertilizer blending.\n\n\n\nThe Facility will continue to operate the Aqua Ammonia Storage and Handling, and Aqua Ammonia Fertilizer Blending covered processes.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 and 3 PSM/RMP have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Report and the Facility PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that will be stored and handled at the Facility is a single railcar (145,680 lbs).  Because the MPR is connected to the railcar when blending, the quantity of anhydrous ammonia is double counted in this EPA RMP.  This same scenario is applicable to the aqua ammonia.  Specifically, the maximum quantity of aqua ammonia is a single AST (26,250 lbs).  Because the fertilizer blender is connected to the AST, the quantity of aqua ammonia is double c"

The WC OCA for the anhydrous ammonia involves an event that results in the release of the entire contents of a railcar (145,680 lbs).  The WC OCA for the aqua ammonia involved an event that results in the release of the entire contents of the AST (26,250 lbs).  The releases for each regulated substance were modeled to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The anhydrous ammonia release was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.  The aqua ammonia was modeled as liquid spill and evaporation from the secondary containment.\n\n\n\nThree alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios were completed for the four covered processes.  The release from Covered Process 1 (i.e. railcar) assumes the release from a leaking vapor valve for 60 minutes.  The release from Covered Process 2 (i.e. fertilizer blending using NH3) assumes a 1-minute release from a failed transfer hose.  The release from Covered Processes 3 and 4 (i.e. Aqua S&H and Fertilizer Blending using Aqua) assumes a transfer hose failure within in a containment and then evaporation of the aqua ammonia.\n\n\n\nAlthough these events are classified as alternative scenarios, accidents of this type are mitigated by safety equipment employed on the processes and written operating procedures.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk mana"
