One of these products is anhydrous ammonia which provides a low cost,easy to handle\nsource of nitrogen for the production of corn and wheat crops. Our facility has an 18000 gallon\nstoage tank from which we transfer ammonia to smaller portable tanks for  sale to our customers.\n     Agrimark has not had any injuries or accidental release of product on record for the past 5 years.\nwith our on going safety and maintenance programs and safe handling practices our plan is to keep\nthis number at 0. Local fire departments along with other local emergency rsponse people recieve\nperiodic updates on our facility along with the proper response and first aid procedures for an ammonia release.\n      Using epa guidelines, a major release of product would occur with a rupture in our main storage tank resulting in a complete dispersal of product in 10 minutes or less. This could affect an area,using epa computations,of up to a 1.5 mile radius around the release site. Wind direction and speed has the largest\neffect on any evacuation scenario. Upon notification the Branch Manager is responsible to contact the\n proper emergency response people per our company emergency action plan.\nEmployees have also been instructed to seek safe haven.\n     A more likely scenario would be that a hose could rupture during the transfer of product. There are some safety features in place to keep any releases to a minimum. there are check valves and excess flow valves that are designedto automaticly close upon the sudden release of product minimizing any accidental release of product. Manual shutoff valves can then be shut to initiate repairs. A possible evacuation area for this scenario would be a radius of .3 mile or less again wind direction and speed will have a large affect on this. \n   With our current measures in place we anticipate no immedant changes in our currrent training,safety, a"
