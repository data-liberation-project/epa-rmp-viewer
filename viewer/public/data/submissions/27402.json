Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of McDonough FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Macomb Fire Department, McDonough County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility,which is located at 1202 W Piper Street, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.      Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.   The storage and handling syustem consist of 1 - 26,000 gallon storage tank, loading riser, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 310,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is 0.1 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydro"

Compliance wisth these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n5. Five year accident history.\n\nThe following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at the facility:\nWe had an accidental release of 1 pound of Anhydrous Ammonia on 6-19-1997 which resulted in injury to an employee.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nInf the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Macomb Fire Department and McDonough County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
