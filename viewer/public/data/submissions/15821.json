Greene Welding Supply is dedicated to protecting the health and safety of it's employees and the public while complying with all applicable laws and regulations.  The only regulated chemical present is chlorine.  This chemical is sold to water systems in the trade area in 150-lb. cylinders only.  The worst case release scenario is the release of one standard cylinder of chlorine in 10 minutes.  Toxic endpoint for the release is .4 miles.  The alternate release scenario is the release of one standard cylinder of chlorine over a period of eight hours from a .1square inch hole.  This scenario represents the greater likleyhood that a chlorine cylinder would develope a leak in the valve and slowly leak down over an extended period of time.  Toxic endpoint for the alternate release scenario is .1 miles.   In the event of a reportable release, the Monroe Fire Department will be notified to respond.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee would also be notified in order to inform the public and effect any other emergency procedures to protect public safety."
