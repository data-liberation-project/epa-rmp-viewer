Carbon fiber is utilized in many important applications such as commercial and military aircraft structural components, satellites, recreation products (golf shafts, fishing rods and tennis rackets), and infrastructure applications (bridges) and industrial products (air tanks, computer housings, etc.). \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHexcel Decatur is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is the foundation of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  Hexcel's program covers areas such as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  For example, our critical control valves are design to \"fail\" close, meaning in a loss of power or other incident they would close preventing a release.  In the unlikely event of a release, we are tied directly to the Emergency Management Association (EMA) who would coordinate an orderly response to minimize the impact.  Through the EMA, the Decatur Fire Department would provide emergency response to our site, if necessary.\n\n\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Hexcel Decatur facility is regulated under RMP due to onsite propane storage being in excess of the 10,000-lb. flammability RMP applicability threshold and onsite acrylonitrile storage being in excess of the 20,000-lb. toxicity RMP applicability threshold.  The propane storage system provides fuel for onsite equipment and consists of one storage tank with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons (127,200-lb).  The acrylonitrile storage system provides raw materials to the process and consists of a s"

The single largest vessel stores a maximum of 100,000 gallons (684,000-lb).    \n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenario assessments were conducted for the facility's single largest vessels based on US EPA's Offsite Consequences Analysis guidance.  For propane, a vapor cloud explosion scenario was considered for both releases and public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release impact zones were (0.41) miles and (0.25) miles, respectively.  NFPA 58 guidance on restricting the maximum propane inventory stored within a vessel to 88% (at 60F) of the vessels rated capacity is followed at the facility to minimize the potential quantity released in an accident scenario.  \n\nFor acrylonitrile, both release scenarios were considered.  Public receptors were determined to be located within the impact zone of both the worst-case and alternative releases.  The resulting worst-case and alternative release scenarios included passive mitigation (cement dike around the tank), which limited the exposed surface area of the pool and thus reduced the release rate.  The impact zones were determined to be (1.70) miles and (0.40) miles, respectively.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated by 1) the existing procedural, training, management and maintenance systems already in place at the facility, and 2) the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented specifically for propane and acrylonitrile in response to the RMP requirements.  The management structure ensures safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and sta"
