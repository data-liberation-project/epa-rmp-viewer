      "SummaryText": "George's, Inc. General Executive Summary for Manufacturing Facilities\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at George's, Inc. Cassville Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry processing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Ammonia (anhydrous) and Chlorine.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for our refrigeration process and chlorine is used for water treatment for wash down procedures.\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 19500.00 lbs and Chlorine is 2000 lbs.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)].  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our poultry processing plant.  In this scenario 19500 lbs of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 50 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 99% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stabi"

      "SummaryText": "lity and 1.78 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 300 ppm.\n\nThe second worst-case release scenario submitted is the release of a full cylinder of chlorine being 2000 lbs.  The liquid/gas mixture would immediately evaporate at atmospheric pressure and would evaporate over a period of 6 minutes.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.78 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.5 miles is obtained corresponding to the toxic endpoint of 10 ppm.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Poultry Processing.  The scenario involves the release of 100 lb. of Toxic liquid, and is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 300 ppm of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 483 yards.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine does not involve a significant amount of the chemical.  There is only storage in the pipe used.  The pipe is approximately 15 feet in length with a diameter of 0.75 inches giving a volume of 0.0462 ft3 hence resulting in a negligible amount that will not create any type of disaster according to ALOHA.  Therefore there is no alternate release data included with the RMP Submit software.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our Processing Plant.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGeorge's, Inc.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses are what if scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of once per year.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 6/16/2004.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, George's, Inc. Processing Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at George's, Inc. Processing Plant.  The most recent review was performed on 06/12/2004.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 6/15/2004.  These audits are carried out at least every year and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nGeorge's, Inc. Processing Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
