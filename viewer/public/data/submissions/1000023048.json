              "Description": "East Mycom Room   -   Anhydrous ammonia is used by the facility as an industrial refrigerant.  Two independent and separate refrigeration processes (plants) are located on site.  The systems are not interconnected, and a catastrophic failure in one system should not affect the other. Moreover, since the systems service separate areas, the probability of a fire or other disaster affecting two systems is low.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigerant System Description\n\n\n\nName/Location ? East Mycom Room\n\nTransfer Method - Glycol/Water System for process cooling\n\nStorage Capacity - 6090 lbs\n\nStorage Pressure - 100 to 120 psi\n\nStorage Temperature - 110?F\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used to chill a glycol/water solution in each compressor and chiller area.  As a result, ammonia does not generally leave the compressor areas, and is not piped into the dairy.  However, compressed liquid ammonia is piped from the Mycom Rooms to heat exchanger coils located in the Cold Rooms (Building B & C).   The heat exchanger coils (chillers) are located in a roof mounted penthouse over Cold Room ?C? (southern portion), and are suspended from the ceiling inside Cold Room ?B? (northern portion).   A leak in these lines or coils could release ammonia liquid and gas into that portion of the plant, and/or the environment. \n\n\n\nReleases of pressurized ammonia could result from a variety of causes, including equipment malfunction, piping or storage system failures, leaking valves, or mechanical damage, e.g. being struck by a fork truck or fire in the area.  Depending on the location in the refrigeration systems, ammonia would be released as a liquid or gas.  However, because of the temperature and pressures within the system, any released liquid would rapidly evaporate into the gaseous phase.   \n\n\n\nSafety control systems installed on the refrigeration processes include:\n\n\n\n?    An emergency ammonia dump system installed on the East Mycom Room (Building K).  If a significant problem were to develop in the refrigeration unit, the dump system could be manually activated.  When activated, the ammonia in the refrigeration unit would be rapidly bubbled through a large water tank.  The water present in the tank would react with the anhydrous ammonia, and should reduce the escape of ammonia to the atmosphere. (Use of this tank is NOT recommended)\n\n\n\n?    An automated airborne ammonia monitoring and alarm system is installed in the East and West Mycom Rooms (Building D).  This system sounds an alarm inside and outside of the refrigeration compressor room if airborne levels of ammonia exceed the alarm set point of 150 ppm (50% of the IDLH).  Activation of the alarm will also start the emergency purge ventilation system and shutdown the ammonia compressor equipment in those rooms.\n\n\n\n?    A high capacity emergency purge ventilation system is also installed in the East and West Mycom rooms (Building D).  When activated, these systems will provide large quantities of fresh air to the room.  The emergency activation control button for the ventilation system is located outside the engine room, near the west and north door.  (Phoenix Fire Department 1997 Unified Fire Code 6311)\n\n\n\n?    Numerous Pressure Safety Valves (PSV) are located throughout each process in critical locations.  The design and installation have been performed in accordance with ASME requirements.  These valves vent to the outside of the building. \n\n\n\n?    Each process is equipped with a logic controlled compressor that is continually supervised by a computerized control system.  Deviations from set safety parameters (temperature, pressure, flow) will immediate stop the compressor and provide a local and remote alarm notification. \n\n\n\n",

A leak in these lines or coils could release ammonia liquid and gas into that portion of the plant, and/or the environment. \n\n\n\nReleases of pressurized ammonia could result from a variety of causes, including equipment malfunction, piping or storage system failures, leaking valves, or mechanical damage, e.g. being struck by a fork truck or fire in the area.  Depending on the location in the refrigeration systems, ammonia would be released as a liquid or gas.  However, because of the temperature and pressures within the system, any released liquid would rapidly evaporate into the gaseous phase.   \n\n\n\nSafety control systems installed on the refrigeration processes include:\n\n\n\n?    An automated airborne ammonia monitoring and alarm system is installed in the East and West Mycom Rooms (Building D).  This system sounds an alarm inside and outside of the refrigeration compressor room if airborne levels of ammonia exceed the alarm set point of 150 ppm (50% of the IDLH).  Activation of the alarm will also start the emergency purge ventilation system and shutdown the ammonia compressor equipment in those rooms.\n\n\n\n?    A high capacity emergency purge ventilation system is also installed in the East and West Mycom rooms (Building D).  When activated, these systems will provide large quantities of fresh air to the room.  The emergency activation control button for the ventilation system is located outside the engine room, near the west and north door.  (Phoenix Fire Department 1997 Unified Fire Code 6311)\n\n\n\n?    Numerous Pressure Safety Valves (PSV) are located throughout each process in critical locations.  The design and installation have been performed in accordance with ASME requirements.  These valves vent to the outside of the building. \n\n\n\n?    Each process is equipped with a logic controlled compressor that is continually supervised by a computerized control system.  Deviations from set safety parameters (temperature, pressure, flow) will immediate stop the compressor and provide a local and remote alarm notification. \n\n",
