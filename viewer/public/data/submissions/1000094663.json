      "SummaryText": "The A.T. Wall Company emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that utilize emergency response services available in the community, when needed. The local emergency planning commission and the local fire department have copies of the A.T. Wall emergency response plan.  The A.T. Wall Company produces high-quality fabricated metal products for a variety of industries.  These include the electronics, telecommunications, aerospace, and chemical industries.  The facility is located on Service Avenue in an industrial park directly off of Jefferson Boulevard, a major north-south thoroughfare in a heavy commercial/industrial area mixed with residential homes.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in an annealing process.  The ammonia is stored in an 8,000 gallon tank filled to a maximum (water) capacity of 6,960 gallons.  Various valves, shutoffs, and alarms help to safeguard against potential releases of ammonia to the community.  The facility is manned 12 hours each work day with up to 60 employees.  It is unmanned during the overnight hours and on weekends.  The Maintenance Manager is on-site each business day and is expected to respond to any alarms or tank malfunction that may occur, day or night.  The fire department is alerted directly whenever an ammonia alarm is sounded and responds day or night.  Note that estimates of the residential population do not include the Adult Correctional Institute.  This population is estimated to be 4,300.  No accidents involving ammonia releases have occurred within the last 5 years."
