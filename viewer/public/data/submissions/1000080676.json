      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\n\nMammoth Pacific has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2735-2785), the EPA Risk Management Program (40CFR68) and Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (California Code of Regulations, Title 8, ?5189). Mammoth Pacific is extremely diligent in the handling of isobutane and normal butane and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Mammoth Pacific staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using isobutane and normal butane for geothermal power production.\n\n\n\nMammoth Pacific has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the isobutane and normal butane systems. Mammoth Pacific's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of normal butane and isobutane.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nMammoth Pacific's geothermal power production facility is fueled by geothermal brine from nearby Casa Diablo Hot Springs, located in Mammoth Lakes, California, approximately 5 miles east of the City of Mammoth Lakes and 0.5 miles east of State Route 395. The area around the facility is rugged and generally uninhabited. The facility uses normal butane and isobutane as binary working fluids, referred to as motive fluid, in a binary Rankine cycle for power production. There are a total of three plants in the facility, comprising two processes; G1 and G2/G3.  G1 (Mammoth Pacific I, MP I) was built in 1984.  In 2013, the select equipment was replaced with newer, more efficient equipment and the motive fluid was changed fr"

In addition to G1, plants G2 (Mammoth Pacific II, MP II) and G3 (Pacific Lighting Energy Systems I, PLES I), were built in 1990.  Both G2 and G3 utilize isobutane as the motive fluid.  In mid-2019, select equipment in G3 was replaced with newer, more efficient equipment.  The Federal RMP and CalARP document are being updated to reflect the process modification.\n\n\n\nIn the binary Rankine cycle, thermal energy from the hot geothermal brine is transferred to the normal butane and isobutane as it is vaporized, pressurized, compressed, and cooled in a power cycle. The electricity generated by this process is then sold to contracted off-takers. \n\nThe site is currently operated by Mammoth Pacific staff and is manned 24 hrs a day. The facility employs approximately 21 personnel.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances managed at the Facility are the motive fluids, normal butane and isobutane. The motive fluid circulates in a closed-loop power cycle, traveling through accumulators, compressors, heat exchangers, turbines, and condensers in order to produce electricity. The maximum intended inventory is 684,604 lbs of isobutane and 155,189 lbs of normal butane.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: One worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for each of the two geothermal power processes. The results can be found in the CalARP Submittal Binder.  \n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: An alternate release scenario was modeled for each of the two geothermal power processes. The results can be found in the CalARP Submittal Binder.\n\nThe scenarios are also displayed in the graphic file attached to the RMP eSubmit document.\n\n\n\n\n\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAlthough the use of normal butane and isobutane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios "

      "SummaryText": "can potentially reach public receptors; Mammoth Pacific has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event improbable. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event improbable, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the vapor cloud explosion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a normal butane or isobutane release: \n\n? Automatic / Manual Shutdown \n\n? Well Designed Relief System \n\n? Perimeter Deluge System.\n\n? Physical Separation of Processes from all but a few potential public receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of the accidental release prevention programs, prevention program elements were documented and implemented by the Mammoth Pacific facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of normal butane and isobutane. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe facility's combined maximum intended inventory normal butane and isobutane is over the 10,000 lbs regulatory threshold quantity. As a result, both covered processes are subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include: \n\n? Process Safety Information\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n\n? Operating Procedures\n\n? Training\n\n? Mechanical Integrity\n\n? Management of Change\n\n? Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n? Compliance Audits \n\n? Incident Investigation \n\n? Employee Participation \n\n? Hot Work Permit\n\n? Contractors\n\n\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan. See EMERGENC"

      "SummaryText": "Y RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no CalARP-reportable accidents with normal butane or isobutane at the Mammoth Pacific facility in the past five (5) years. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nMammoth Pacific staff are not First Responders. Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency. Mammoth Pacific will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. Mammoth Pacific has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 3220 is in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS INFORMATION\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, 2745.7(q); the following external events analysis information were reviewed and are submitted with the CalARP documentation: \n\n\n\n? The types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2. \n\n   o During the May, 2019 PHA a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of isobutane were addressed. The External Events that were considered are detailed within the PHA worksheets, which are included in the CalARP document.\n\n\n\n?    A seismic assessment of piping and equipment was performed in June, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the May, 2019 PHA Report. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by December, 2019.\n\n\n\n"
