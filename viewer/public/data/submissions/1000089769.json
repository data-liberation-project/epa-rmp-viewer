Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nLakeside Organic Gardens conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\n\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Lakeside Organic Gardens facility acts as a stationary source for regulated substance anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia system is used for cold storage, vacuum cooling, and hydrocooling operations. The facility operates throughout the year as produce precooling and cold storage facility. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to facility drawings in Appendix A.2.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards in 2017 as part of the newly constructed Lakeside Organic Gardens facility. Refrigeration system is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. The fixed equipment includes, two"

Portable equipment includes a half car vacuum tube and a hydrocooler. These equipment stay on site all the time. All refrigeration equipment except evaporative condenser, vacuum tube and the hydrocooler are located indoors.\r\n\r\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical rooms for alarming and initiating emergency exhaust fan and stopping all equipment in the engine room when high ammonia concentration level is reached. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry from this system is shown in Section V.A.2. The total ammonia charge of approximately 11,062 lb 9,600 lb is completely sealed and pressurized within the system.\r\n\r\nRefrigeration system drawings are located in Appendix A.2. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in the schedules located on sheet R0.0. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix A.1, describe equipment details. Sheets 2.0 and 2.1 in Appendix A.2 show the refrigeration equipment layout.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pu"

Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nLakeside Organic Gardens maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation.\r\n\r\nLakeside Organic Gardens is a Non-Responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Facility Managers, RMP Administrator and designated Emergency Responders as outlined in Section VI.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Refrigeration contractors and facility technicians are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. Refrigeration engine room has emergency shut off switches outside the engine room doors that can shut down the system without entering the engine room. Control system also initiates emergency exhaust fan in case of high ammonia levels and shuts down the system automatically if the ammonia concentration level in engine room reaches the high set level.

The relief valves in the system are all tied into the diffusion tank.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nLakeside Organic Gardens is a new facility that started operation in August 2017.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency action plan and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. Description of the emergency action plan is included in Appendix N.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\r\n\r\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
