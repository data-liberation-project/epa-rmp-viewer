The primary focus is to prevent accidental releases before they occur, while providing systems that minimize any release that may occur and contain it in as small as area as possible.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  It is the Facility's policy to operate the plant in a manner that protects its employees, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The Facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND STATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The Facility is a new construction for production of an advanced fuel ethanol from agricultural residue, corn cobs and stover. The Facility utilizes 2 to 3% denaturant in finished product blending (natural gasoline, CAS 6825-31-0, mainly composed of pentane [95%] as per federal and state requirements to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. The Facility has a denaturant storage tank of approximately 125,000 gallons capacity and the associated process lines that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements. EPA's CAPP requires a Hazard Assessment and the development of a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical (due to the main component - pentane) which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation. The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the denaturant storage tank and the associated transfer/blending equipment and piping.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS: The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with"

      "SummaryText": " a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 125,000 gallons of denaturant with a specific gravity of 0.65 (modeled mixture composed of 644,130 lbs of pentane) from the storage tank. The maximum distance to the 1-PSI endpoint for this WCS was 0.7 miles. A total of 2 estimated public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.7 mile radius. The 2 public receptors were residences. The estimated residential population within the 0.7 mile radius is 5 people based on US Census data for Shelbyville, IN indicating average residential occupancy rate of 2.5 individuals per household. The most likely alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance was a failure of tank piping. Release volume was assumed to the entire contents of the vessel. The ARS assumed a pool fire (worst case outcome) of 644,130 lbs of denaturant (pentane) for the purpose of running RMP*Comp released from a 6-inch flange over a period of 11 minutes. The maximum distance to the endpoint of 5 kw/m2 for 40 sec for this event was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.2 miles. Zero public and zero environmental receptors were identified within the 0.2 mile endpoint radius. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The Facility is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, passive mitigation, employee training, and emergency response preparation. The Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment. The Facility is fully lighted.

The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors). The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms. Critical aspects of process control can be performed remotely. The covered process  storage tanks have secondary containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.

The plan consists of procedures for responding\n\nto a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable\n\nsubstance is accidentally released.
