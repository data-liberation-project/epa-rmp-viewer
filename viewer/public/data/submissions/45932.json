      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\n\nThetford Corporation operates a holding tank deodorant blending and bottling operation in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The facility is located at 7101 Jackson Road in Scio Township.  The facility consists of one building that houses the blending and bottling operation, as well as product development and offices.  Overall, the facility employs 82 full time employees.\n\nThetford Corp is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Thetford has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the process at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (RMP).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at the Thetford facility.  This document is intended to satisfy that requirement and to provide the public with a description of the RMP at the plant.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThetford implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of formaldehyde.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the facility, programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant, equipment to continuously monitor formaldehyde in the mixing and storage areas.\n\nIn addition, the operating system is designed and operated with redundant safety systems and instrumentation. The purpose of these systems is to provide back-up safety protection in the event a primary safety system fails.  Modern technology is used in the design and construction of the process.  All modifications are inspected and reviewed before start-up.  Tanks used to "

      "SummaryText": "store chemicals are placed in concrete secondary containment areas to prevent possible leaks or releases.  The tanker unload area is designed to contain all spills from a truck and prevent formaldehyde from reaching soil, ground or surface water.  All tanks storing formaldehyde are equipped with high level switches that alert operators that the tanks are full and shutdown transfers or agitation of the tank to prevent overfilling. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, Thetford contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  Thetford provides emergency response training to its personnel and designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities.  Employee training was expanded in 2004 to Hazardous Materials Technician level.  This allows the team to respond to releases of formaldehyde in an aggressive manner with the intention of stopping the release.  Decontamination and Incident Command System procedures were also expanded and are rehearsed semi-annually. Thetford also coordinates response efforts with the local fire department and the LEPC.  \n\nTo effectively implement these policies, Thetford established a management system headed by the Chief Operating Officer of Thetford to oversee safety-related activities.\n\nRegulated substance:\n\nFormaldehyde is the regulated substance handled in sufficient quantity to be covered by EPA?s RMP rule.  It is the major active ingredient in the holding tank deodorants produced in the blending and bottling process.  The products are used in the holding tanks of recreational vehicles, boats and portable toilets.  Formaldehyde is received as a 37% solution in water.  The maximum amount of actual formaldehyde allowed in the storage tanks is limited by administrative controls.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nIn 1995, Thetford developed and implemented a prevention program for the formaldehyde"

      "SummaryText": " process to comply with the 13 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  Thetford is in full compliance with the OSHA standard.  The EPA RMP rule expands the OSHA PSM to include a focus on protecting the public and the environment.  According to an outside consultant who performed a compliance audit, ?The Thetford Corporation has conscientiously developed and implemented the PSM program at its facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The effort expended by all levels of management and labor at the facility to comply with the PSM standard and implement the PSM program is excellent.?  The following highlights a few specific steps that are key to the prevention program.\n\n1. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)  - Thetford performs process hazard analyses on all mixing processes (formaldehyde and non-formaldehyde) in the building to identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A PHA committee reviews all recommendations from the PHA.  A schedule of action items and completion due dates are developed by the committee and assigned to individuals with responsibility in the respective area.\n\n2. Management of Change (MOC) - Thetford?s Management of Change (MOC) program ensures that changes made to the system do not alter the safe operation of the system.  The MOC is designed to prevent changes occurring to the system until proper safety reviews, training, material updates, and procedures have been modified to reflect the change.  The only changes that do not have to follow the management of change procedure are \"replacement in kind\". \n\n3. Mechanical Integrity - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Program is to make certain that the equipment in the process is installed, maintained, operated, inspected and tested to ensure its continued safe operation.  The program is designed to address the specific needs of each type of equipment covered. The Mechanical Integrity Program covers all"

Incident Investigation - Thetford investigates all incidents that resulted in or could have resulted in a release of formaldehyde so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n5. Formaldehyde Specific Prevention Steps\n\nFormaldehyde solution is delivered to the facility by offsite vendors.  The formaldehyde solution is pumped directly to storage tanks inside the building.  The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde solution to storage tanks.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training annually emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by Thetford.   The unload area can contain the entire contents of a ruptured tanker.  All spilled materials can be transferred to an indoor recovery tank from a remote control panel.  Two bulk formaldehyde storage tanks contain redundant high level switches to prevent storage tank overflows by automatically stopping the transfer.  Additional precautions are maintained with the PSM program.  These include a Truck Driver Unload Policy that every delivery service must accept and adhere to when unloading at the facility, an unload checklist to double check connections before unloading, a remote emergency shut off to stop the operation in case of failure, preventative maintenance program to avoid failure of equipment during operation, and annual certification of the corresponding Standard Operating Procedure. \n\nFive -Year Accident History\n\nThetford has completed a five-year acciden"

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the following:  \n\n1.Informing the local fire department about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences \n2.Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to formaldehyde at the facility\n3.Containing accidental releases of formaldehyde including the use of emergency response equipment\n4.Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n5.Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\nThe facility maintains an emergency response team trained in the above emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  The plant annually conducts emergency response drills.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has been directly communicated to local emergency response officials.  The plant maintains a regular dialogue with the local fire chief and the facility provides appropriate information to the fire chief.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\n1.Regular communication with the local responding agencies to improve awareness of possible hazards and emergency response plans.\n2.Employee emergency response training and drills will continue to ensure employees are familiar with the procedures.\n3.Develop a mobile command center so not dependent on wind conditions during a release."
