Russell.\nCraig Engelhard, our Safety Manager, is a member of the AMI, American Meat Institute, safety committee. During these conferences, they have addressed topics of Process Safety Management for Ammonia Refrigeration, electrical safety, written SOPA?s and threat and risk. Annually I attend the IIAR convention. We have a very good relationship with our local OSHA office, and have favorably united on different programs with them to create and maintain a safe facility as possible. To show another example for our commitment to our employees, we were the first food processing facility in the United States, to allow NIOSH to review our practices and procedures and used their recommendations to help our company be more efficient with proper procedures. We have monthly safety meetings that cover different safety topics. This will range from ammonia within our facility to safety awareness at home. Being a ready-to-eat food processor, food safety is an on going procedure on a daily basis.\n\nTraining is also very important at Cloverdale Foods. Our Safety Manager has attended numerous safety seminars, and myself, Larry Huether, as stated earlier, attend annually the IIAR conference. This conference deals with new technology, new equipment and has many different topics discussed from better and safer practices to being more energy efficient.\n\n\nHere are some of the topics discussed at our monthly safety meetings:\nJanuary 2008 A? Spill Containment/Hearing Conservation\nFebruary 2008 A? Lockout/Tagout\nMarch 2008 A? Emergency Evacuation\nApril 2008 A? Ergonomics and Back Safety\nMay 2008 A? Chemical Safety Sanitation\nJune 2008 A? Hygiene\nJuly 2008 A? Fire Extinguisher\nAugust 2008 A? Incident Report Procedures\nSeptember"

Hearing Conservations\n\nOn an annual basis we meet with our local fire department. During this time we tour the entire facility, discuss anything that might be a danger to our facility or employees and revisit our emergency response program. \nOur emergency response program is: if we have a leak that is 50 ppm, we are trained to wear a MSA gas mask, if the leak reaches 300 ppm, all employees evacuate the building. At this time we contact our local fire department and inform them of an ammonia leak. Our fire department will then contact a local gas refinery company, Tesoro, that has trained personnel with the proper attire to respond to hazardous chemicals. \nOn June 9, 2009, Tesoro Refinery had twenty of their  trained Emergency Response crew come to Cloverdale where I, Larry Huether, Plant Engineer, gave a classroom presentation, along with a plant tour, including a roof tour of the companies anhydrous ammonia system.\nTopics that were covered:\n1.    Where to meet if an emergency ever existed.\n2.    Where our employees were to congregate (different locations-depending on wind direction).\n3.    Who would be CloverdaleA?s representative.\n4.    Address level of ammonia for Cloverdale employees to evacuate.\n5.    Where portable detectors are stored.\n\nIt is planned now to have approximately forty of Mandan, North Dakota firefighters, full time and volunteers to do the same training at Cloverdale on June 23rd. And to also have a mock drill later this fall for all three parties, Cloverdale, Tesoro and our local fire department.\n\nDuring our orientation for new employees and monthly safety meetings, our employees have been explained where to congregate once leaving the building, depending on wind direction. And all supervisors have been trained on being accountable for the employees working in their department. The maintenance department "

      "SummaryText": "has a hand held ammonia detector located outside the facility, that will be used to monitor the level of ammonia before reentering the building.\n\nThe system in place for ammonia detection is a Manning leak detection system. All of our ammonia compressors and vessels are in one room, therefore the detector is in the compressor room with the display outside in the maintenance shop area. If there is a leak, an alarm will sound in the shop, allowing any personnel to see the level of leak in the compressor room without entering the compressor room. If any individual is in the compressor room and a leak is present, there is an orange light warning that the level is 50 ppm, employees have been trained at this point, a MSA is required. If the level gets 300 ppm, a complete evacuation of the facility is required.\n\nAll of our ammonia valve stations that control the evaporators inside the building are located outside on the roof. Therefore, if there are any leaks in any room, excluding the compressor room, it can be quickly isolated and controlled.\n\nAs stated earlier, we are a food manufacturing facility that produces sausage products, franks, hams and bacon. All of the anhydrous ammonia is used for refrigeration. The receiver, accumulators, and compressors are all located on the southeast corner of the building with an outside door in this room. We have approximately 15,600 #A?s of ammonia in our systems. We have three separate systems in our facility. 1. a high suction that we use for processing rooms, 2. a medium suction that we use for product holding coolers, and 3. a low suction that is used for two blast freezers. There are room temperatures that need to be met to comply with our local U.S.D.A. regulations.\n\nWe have an intense preventative maintenance program established not only for the ammonia system, but for all systems and equipment. This program ensures that all of the ammonia equipment and vessels along with its safety controls are operational and in running condi"

A?\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity Program was also revised and updated as required by 40 CFR 68.73. All of our pipes and valves are identified properly as ANSI/ASHRAE 15,1994, Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration, Sec. 11.2.2 requires. An identification scheme was established and working well. Our pressure relief valves were all changed to meet the five year maximum.\n\nWe have not had any major accidental releases, there have been minor releases, such as valve packing gland leaks, etcA?, all of these leaks were identified and repaired immediately during our daily or weekly preventative checks.\n\nAs stated earlier, employee training is mandatory at our company. All of CloverdaleA?s refrigeration technicians have gone through classroom training conducted by the same company that has done 100 % of the refrigeration installation. \n\n\n"
