As part of the manufacturing operations, aerosol propellants are transferred from storage tanks at the facility to individual product containers.  These chemicals are highly flammable substances that are carefully managed to minimize the risks of fire or explosion.\n\nThe chemicals (propellants) that are present at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantities are as follows:\n\nPropane/Butane (50/50 Mixture)     58,370 lbs.     Tanks No. 13, 14, 25, and 26\nPropane/Butane (19/81 Mixture)     51,040 lbs.     Tanks No. 15 and 16\nDifluoroethylene                   15,100 lbs.     Tanks No. 27 and 28.\n\nThe covered process for AMREP, per Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule, is the transfer of the above listed propellents into product containers on three of the four production lines (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri high speed rotary lines) located on AMREP's property.  The propellants are transfered via piping into three seperate gas rooms (one gas room services one of the above listed production lines) where the product containers are filled and then sealed before exiting the gas room.  The 50/50 Propane/Butane mixture is stored in two, bullet-style, 1,000-gallon above ground storage (AST) tanks and one, bullet-style, 5,000-gallon AST tank and one, bullet-style, 6,000-gallon AST tank.  The 19/81 Propane/Butane mixture is stored in two, bullet-style, 5,500-gallon AST tanks.  The difluoroethylene is stored in two, bullet-style, 1,000-gallon AST tanks.  The propellants in the above listed tanks are considered to be interconnected vessels, per RMP Rule, via the transfer piping and are considered to be a part of one covered process, which includes the tanks (listed above) and the associated transfer piping and gas rooms.  The process is considered to end once the product containers are sealed and le"

These chemicals are transferred from storage tanks to production areas and placed in product containers.  The main hazards associated with the covered process are fire and explosion resulting from an accidental chemical (propellant) release. \n\n\nHOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\nAMREP maintains a comprehensive prevention program as required by the RMP Rule, with the objective of preventing accidental releases and other accidents from the covered process.  Access to the property and to individual areas of the facility is strictly controlled by an electronic security system.  An active explosion suppression system is installed in the gas rooms where the transfer of propellants to product containers occurs.\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS HAZARDS\n\nAMREP has implemented a Process Safety Management Program, as required by OSHA, that includes a systematic review of the hazards at the facility and a comprehensive management system to address the identified hazards and improve process safety.  This program is fully integrated with the prevention program under the RMP Rule, so that the hazard analysis, including off-site consequence analyses, encompasses accidental release prevention from the above mentioned covered process.  All of these efforts are conducted under the direction of the Safety Department, which includes top-level management personnel.  It should be noted, that AMREP is currently updating the Process Hazard Analysis procedures for the current equipment/processes considered PSM \"covered processes.\"  The covered process, referenced in the first section of this summary, is a part of the equipment/processes that are currently going through PHA procedure updates.   \n\nRESPONSE ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE\n\nAMREP maintains a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan that addresses numerous potential emergencies at the "
