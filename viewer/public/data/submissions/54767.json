Personnel\u00bfs training is necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety. SGRRl's training plan achieves this goal. These programs are all documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is available to employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team\r\nstaff and the Facility Emergency Coordinators when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.

Wastes that may contain more than 1% of any of these regulated substances would be transported to the facility via either enclosed trucks in 55-gallon drums or smaller containers, or in bulk transport vehicles. These wastes may be temporarily stored on-site and then consolidated with other similar1y classified waste streams or they may be directly transferred to other TSDF's for processing. Flammable and toxic wastes are stored in separate areas.\r\n\r\nFlammable wastes are pumped from the drums and consolidated into larger tanks that contain mixtures that have a NFPA rating of 3 or less. Therefore, once a regulated flammable substance is pumped into a storage tank, it is no longer subject to ARP.\r\n\r\nToxic substances that are processed are temporarily stored in containers.\r\n\r\nThe EPA risk management regulation identifies three levels of requirements.

(SGRRI) operates a hazardous waste treatment and storage facility (TSDF) in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste license issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. SGRRI strives to conduct its business and operations in strict conformity with all applicable laws, and in a safe and responsible manner. SGRRI has always placed the highest priority on the health and safety of its employees and members of the community in which it operates.\r\n\r\nSGRRI may be subject to the provisions of the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements because regulated toxic and flammable liquids may be present in quantities which may on occasion exceed the regulatory thresholds for these substances. Accordingly, SGRRI has prepared a Risk Management Plan under the U.S. EPA's predictive filing provisions. SGRRI will not exceed the threshold quantities for toxic gases and flammable gases.\r\n\r\nSGRRl's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices. The SGRRI facility is designed, constructed, inspected, maintained and operated in a manner so as to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the public to hazardous materials managed at the site, and in conformity with all governmental regulations.\r\n\r\nSGRRI has a comprehensive inspection plan which requires daily, weekly, monthly. and annual inspections of its processes, equipment and management practices.\r\n\r\nSGRRI has a Contingency Plan which prescribes procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or release at the facility. The Contingency Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state and federal emergency response officials of incidents, and specifies arrangements which are made with emergency responders to ensure an effective response in the event of an emergency."

An emergency response plan has been developed which prescribes emergency procedures which the facility will implement in the event of a release or fire at the facility.\r\n\r\nSGRRl's emergency response plan is identified as the facility Contingency Plan. The purpose of this plan is to describe both the hazards associated with the management of waste materials at the facility and the steps which will be taken to minimize the risk associated with each hazard. By ensuring that proper preventative measures are taken at all times and by providing for emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of any unexpected occurrence(s), SGRRI intends to operate its facility in a manner that does not pose a significant threat to public health, safety or welfare of the environment.
