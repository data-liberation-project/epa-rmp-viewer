EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC's Illinois Refining Division (hereafter referred to as \"IRD\") is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for IRD workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, IRD has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at IRD and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan describing the Risk Management Program at IRD. This document is intended to satisfy the Risk Management Plan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at IRD.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIRD is committed to the safety of its workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. IRD implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases. IRD evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary and responds based on our capabilities and training. If necessary, outside emergency responders, including the local fire department, would be contacted to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release. IRD, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the community if an accident occurs t"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager. Those relationships are depicted on the Division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager's staff. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Division Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division Environmental and Safety Manager. A Division PSM Coordinator is responsible for the RMP hazard assessment, while the Environmental department is responsible for the Risk Management Plan. The Division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Safety Supervisor. In keeping with the policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other Division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2  IRD Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nIRD is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Robinson, Illinois. Petroleum crude oil is the primary feedstock from which a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, petroleum coke, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane, are produced. Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in the process units above the EPA threshold quantity (typically 10,000 pounds). In total, IRD has 16 processes that are covered by the RMP rule because of the presence of flammable process materials. These processes are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements).\n\n\n\nIn additi"

Anhydrous ammonia is used in the Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) reduction section of the Crude unit to help minimize NOx emissions to the atmosphere. These units are covered because they contain more than the EPA RMP threshold quantities of hydrofluoric acid and anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nIRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. IRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like IRD. Alternative release scenarios can be used to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. The release scenario analyses have been submitted to EPA and have been shared with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents and businesses. The paragraphs below briefly describe some of the scenarios that were analyzed. These are the scenarios that have been included in detail in the Risk Management Plan. Please recognize that none of these events have occurred at the facility. Also, for some of these events, there are emergency mitigation systems that should help reduce the consequences of the events if they did occur. In all cases, if such events occurred, the emergency response plan would be activated to respond to the event, notify local authorities as necessary, and take appropriate actions to protect both the employees and people in the community.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-ca"

If such a failure released the maximum inventory of the tank (410,000 pounds), the HF acid would vaporize, resulting in a toxic exposure hazard in the downwind area that would extend outside of the boundary of the refinery. As specified by EPA, this analysis assumes that all of the HF acid is released to the air and no credit is taken for operation of the HF acid vapor mitigation system (i.e., a water spray system to reduce the amount of vapor that leaves the unit if released).\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion, involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a mixture of butane, isobutane, and isopentane. The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 4,200,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Because there are some public receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members of the public at those closest locations.\n\n\n\nThere are no Program 1 processes at the refinery; therefore, no additional worst-case analyses are reported in this Risk Management Plan. Also, no worst-case scenarios were identified that would affect public receptors other than the receptors affected by the scenarios reported above.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nNumerous alternative release scenarios for toxic materials (HF acid and anhydrous ammonia) were considered. The toxic alternative release scenario that is reported as part of the Risk Management Plan for HF acid involves a release of HF acid from a hose failure during tanker truck unloading. This would result in a release of 4,617 pounds of HF acid in the time required to isolate the truck and the acid storage tank, thereby stopping the release. No c"

The analysis indicated that the resulting HF vapor cloud could result in toxic exposures to people outside the refinery boundary. The toxic alternative release scenario that is reported as part of the Risk Management Plan for anhydrous ammonia involves a release of ammonia from a hose failure during tanker truck unloading. This would result in a release of 1,326 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the time required to isolate the truck and the ammonia storage tank, thereby stopping the release. The analysis indicated that the resulting ammonia vapor cloud could result in toxic exposures to people outside the refinery boundary.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario in the Risk Management Plan for flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion from a failure of a transfer hose during propane truck loading. The hose failure would release 24,800 pounds of flammable material in the time required to isolate the release. The analysis assumed that all of this material would be involved in a vapor cloud explosion and showed that the resulting overpressure from the explosion would affect public receptor locations outside the refinery.\n\n\n\nAs stated previously, the details regarding these scenarios are included in the additional information submitted to EPA with this executive summary, and this information is shared with the LEPC, other organizations involved in emergency planning, and members of the local community.

The PSM program at this facility has been extended by IRD, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nIRD encourages employees to participate in all facets of Process Safety Management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the IRD accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at IRD and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, IRD has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nIRD keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, IRD has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Critical Process Variables Document. IRD ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nIRD also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nIRD has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n\n\nIRD primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of"

Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ensures that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prioritized attention. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, IRD periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. Offsite consequences have been incorporated in all PHA's completed after August 1996. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nIRD maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, IRD has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in IRD operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and/or skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nIRD uses contractors to supplement the work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nIRD has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
