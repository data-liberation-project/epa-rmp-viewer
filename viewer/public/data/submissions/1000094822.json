FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nPregis has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. As a result of Pregis's stringent release prevention programs, there have been no significant accidental releases or incidents during this period.\r\n\r\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nPregis maintains a written emergency evacuation plan for the safety of our employees during accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies. Pregis employees do not directly respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nEmergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to ensure proper functioning. Upon modification of the covered process, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes within the covered process that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n6.

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Marshall County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Plymouth Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that are used as packaging material. We use isobutane, a regulated substance, as a blowing agent at this facility.\r\n\r\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit IDT099-5696-00028 from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
