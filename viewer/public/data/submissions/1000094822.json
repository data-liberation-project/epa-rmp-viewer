This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Marshall County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Plymouth Fire Department to provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that are used as packaging material. We use isobutane, a regulated substance, as a blowing agent at this facility.\n\n\n\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. In addition, we have one process at our facility which is subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit IDT099-5696-00028 from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at Pregis.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPregis maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analy"
