      "SummaryText": "Farm and Home Oil Company (F&H) is a petroleum product distributor and wholesaler. The Macungie Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users throughout Lehigh, Berks, Northampton, and Bucks Counties and surrounding areas of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, kerosene, No. 2 fuel oil, propane, and various petroleum based additives for sale by F&H to its customers. A new section of this facility will house propane for retail and wholesale distribution beginning in 2005, thus requiring a new Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) program.\n\nThe PSM/RMP program is intended for the propane side of the Terminal (from hereon referred to as ?the Facility?) and complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) PSM Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) for RMPs.  \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies: \n\nThe primary function of the Facility is to act as a propane distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  F&H is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which propane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the equipment.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which adds to the safety of the Facility.\n\nThe Facility complies with the National Fire Protection Association?s (NFPA?s) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Code (NFPA-58"

      "SummaryText": ") requirements for LP-Gas storage.  In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of propane, if a release does occur, an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Macungie Fire Department and local Emergency Agencies.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at the Facility:\n\nThe RMP regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is propane. The maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 1,332,000 pounds.\n \nThe primary purpose of the Facility is to repackage and distribute propane to both retail and wholesale customers for use as a fuel. Propane is received by rail car and by truck (transports) and stored in six 60,000-gallon storage tanks. Propane is distributed to retail customers by delivery trucks (bobtails) and to wholesale customers by bobtails and transports.  Department of Transportation (DOT) containers are filled for use by retail customers. The Facility has equipment for unloading rail cars and transports and equipment to load bobtails, transports and DOT containers. Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario: \n\nThe calculations for the following worst case and alternative release scenarios were performed using the EPA?s RMP*Comp software program. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would result in the release of an estimated quantity of 222,000 pounds of propane. F&H policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 88% at 60 F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to th"

The excess flow valves will function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are released over a 10-minute duration.  The distance to the endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for the alternative scenario is 0.06 miles (316 feet).  This release does not have the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Facility complies with 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The Facility is designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, 2004 Edition. All propane delivery drivers will be thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association?s (NPGA?s) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP). \n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nSince this is a RMP for a planned propane distribution facility, no RMP-covered process equipment exists as of the submittal date of this document.  Consequently, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years.\n\nThe emergency response program: \n\nResponse actions are coordinated with the Macungie Fire Department. An Emergency Response Plan is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Facility will begin operations in 2005 in compliance with the NFPA-58 Standard that is applicable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (1992 Edition)."
