This rail storage yard is enclosed with perimeter fencing and cameras that can detect motion along the fenceline.  Camera images are sent back to the main plant via a wireless transmission. The site also contains chlorine monitors that monitor for leaks and would alarm at the main Gate 4. \n\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at Olin. We understand that we are an integral part of the community.  We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in the early 1990's and is comprised of community members who represent near neighbors, business, and education.  Quarterly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests.  \n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin Niagara Falls Plant.  Our primary products, chlorine and caustic soda, are used to make everything from paper products, textiles, water treatment, household bleach, pharmaceuticals, vinyl products and household goods.\n\nOlin has a safety and environmental program which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable. Our goal is Zero incidents. To help insure that an emergency situation with off-site implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety and environmental protection in place: Employees, Mechanical Integrity, Process Hazard Review, Proces"

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFET\nOlin looks closely at Process Safety. We have captured Process Safety Incidents and near misses in our Action Management Tool (AMT). We have also developed both lagging and leading indicators for Process Safety and trend the results. operation. Hazard reviews identify things that could possibly go wrong so that these situations can be addressed before an incident occurs.\n\nEmergency Response:\nThe key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the scene quickly, including both on-site and off-site emergency responders.  Olin Niagara maintains our own response team, Olin Corporation Emergency Action Network (OCEAN) and equipment to minimize response time.  We also work in conjunction with the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the Niagara County L.E.P.C. to respond to any off site releases.\n\nSecurity:\nThe Foote Yard is protected by Security cameras where images are transmitted back to the main Gate 4 giving full view of the storage area. The security at the facility has been reviewed by local police agencies and an approved site security plan was received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at the Foote Yard. During the past five year, we have had no off-site accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule.\n\nIf such an incident"
