      "SummaryText": "is used in both of the mills' water treatment plants. \nThe water treatment plant's only source of chlorine is from one-ton containers.  Two containers are connected to the water treatment evaporation system located in a raw water filter #57 building.  Up to eight full containers are stored in a sheltered process area adjacent to the raw water filter building #57.  The maximum inventory is 20,000 lbs. included in process and storage containers.\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include:  the eight each one-ton container in the storage area and the raw water filter building #57, which contains two one ton containers and all associated piping, vents and exhaust systems.  It also includes the service water pump building #56, feed and injection systems.\nThe facility has one chlorine dioxide generation, storage and distribution process.  The R-8 process was installed in March of 2001.  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1.2 % of a liquid mixture that is generated and stored in two 60,190 gallon tanks.   These tanks are surrounded by a dike system.  The maximum intended inventory of these storage tanks and associated piping, reaction vessels, etc. is equal to 13,255 lbs of chlorine dioxide.  A single vessel contains a maximum of 6,025 lbs of chlorine dioxide in the solution.  The solution is pumped to the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant for use there.\n1.2.2.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE (b)(2)\nChlorine and chlorine dioxide are the only regulated substances on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantities. \n1.3.\tWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\nThe worst case and alternate scenarios were evaluated using both EPA guidance and air dispersion modeling.  \nAn off-site consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule to estimate potential impacts to the community.

      "SummaryText": "release for each covered chemical.\n\n1.3.1.\tWORST CASE   (c)(1)\nThe worst case scenario involves the total release of the contents of one 60,190 gallon chlorine storage tank.  The worst case release is defined by EPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in \u00a7 68.22.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  Specifically, the EPA requires worst case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind, which would not disperse a release effectively. Further, the modeling requirements assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released instantaneously.  The chances of such an event occurring on a 98\u00b0F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely remote.  \nWorst case releases for the chlorine water treatment process were evaluated.  The evaluation was performed using B/AB and EPA's INPUFF Models.  (INPUFF was used as a chlorine dioxide release is not a dense gas.  That worst case had a significantly smaller distance to the endpoint than the release of 60,190 gallons of solution equivalent to 6,025 lbs. of chlorine dioxide.  Under the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill (for purposes of RMP) would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mill's property line.\n1.3.2.\tALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nS. D. Warren developed alternative scenarios for chlorine and chlorine dioxide, which focus on more realistic releases occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modeling a release, which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the process hazard analyses (PHAs) performed on covered processes, and all"

      "SummaryText": "1.\t EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 68.155\nS. D. Warren Company operates an integrated pulp and paper mill.  The mill is located at 2400 Lakeshore Drive, Muskegon, Michigan.  The Pulp Mill and Utility Department operates two process units, which contain EPA listed highly hazardous chemicals over the regulated threshold.  Chlorine is used in the Utility Water Treatment Plant.  Chlorine dioxide is generated in a separate, state of the art, production unit that supplies the Bleach Plant with 1.2% solution.\nS.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  Since 1980 we have developed many programs that eliminate or minimize the effects of an accidental release.  In 1992 the mill adopted the OSHA Process Management Program (PSM).  In 1999 the mill implemented the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP program).  In 2001 the mill installed and commissioned a new R-8 state of the art chlorine dioxide generation unit.  This permitted shutting down and decommissioning of two RMP covered processes.  The first was the chlorine dioxide unit in use since 1990 including two 15,000 gallon storage tanks for 1.0% solution.  The second unit decommissioned was a bulk chlorine railcar storage, unloading, distribution and evaporation chlorination unit.  Both units had supplied the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant.  The chlorine unit had also been the primary supply to the water treatment plant.  Removal of these two units reduced the worst case area and greatly reduced the potential impact. This has significantly improved the safety of the mills operations.  All of this was accomplished in compliance with the RMP regulation.\nS. D. Warren 's Risk Management Program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found in 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One requirement of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) to the EPA whenever a unit is decommissioned.  This RMP Plan submission"
