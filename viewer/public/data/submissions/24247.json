The Pulp Mill and Utility Department operates two process units, which contain EPA listed highly hazardous chemicals over the regulated threshold.  Chlorine is used in the Utility Water Treatment Plant.  Chlorine dioxide is generated in a separate, state of the art, production unit that supplies the Bleach Plant with 1.2% solution.\nS.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  Since 1980 we have developed many programs that eliminate or minimize the effects of an accidental release.  In 1992 the mill adopted the OSHA Process Management Program (PSM).  In 1999 the mill implemented the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP program).  In 2001 the mill installed and commissioned a new R-8 state of the art chlorine dioxide generation unit.  This permitted shutting down and decommissioning of two RMP covered processes.  The first was the chlorine dioxide unit in use since 1990 including two 15,000 gallon storage tanks for 1.0% solution.  The second unit decommissioned was a bulk chlorine railcar storage, unloading, distribution and evaporation chlorination unit.  Both units had supplied the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant.  The chlorine unit had also been the primary supply to the water treatment plant.  Removal of these two units reduced the worst case area and greatly reduced the potential impact. This has significantly improved the safety of the mills operations.  All of this was accomplished in compliance with the RMP regulation.\nS. D. Warren 's Risk Management Program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA's\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found in 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One requirement of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) to the EPA whenever a unit is decommissioned.  This RMP Plan submission"

It integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) found in the 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A)(1)\nS. D. Warren has a management system in place which oversees the implementation and ongoing use of the RMP elements.  The Vice President / Mill Manager is responsible for RMP implementation.  Attached is an organization chart that depicts the positions and lines of authority of this management system.  This program, along with other mill policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood and consequences of a hazardous chemical release.\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (A)(2)\nS. D. Warren maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program is based on the EPA's Program Level 3 elements.  The RMP elements have been combined with like elements of the mill's OSHA PSM program. \n1.2.    S. D. WARREN STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING AT THE MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN SITE (b)\nThe mill employs 684 full-time employees (including all medical or other laid off employees), some of whom operate the covered processes.  Today, bulk chlorine in one ton containers is only used as part of the water production operations.  Chlorine dioxide is generated in the March, 2001, commissioned, single R-8 unit.  It feeds a 1.2% chlorine dioxide in water solution to the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant.\n1.2.1.    SITE DESCRIPTION (b)(1)\nThe facility has chlorine storage at one location.  Chlorine from this system "

The maximum inventory is 20,000 lbs. included in process and storage containers.\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include:  the eight each one-ton container in the storage area and the raw water filter building #57, which contains two one ton containers and all associated piping, vents and exhaust systems.  It also includes the service water pump building #56, feed and injection systems.\nThe facility has one chlorine dioxide generation, storage and distribution process.  The R-8 process was installed in March of 2001.  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1.2 % of a liquid mixture that is generated and stored in two 60,190 gallon tanks.   These tanks are surrounded by a dike system.  The maximum intended inventory of these storage tanks and associated piping, reaction vessels, etc. is equal to 13,255 lbs of chlorine dioxide.  A single vessel contains a maximum of 6,025 lbs of chlorine dioxide in the solution.  The solution is pumped to the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant for use there.\n1.2.2.

WORST CASE   (c)(1)\nThe worst case scenario involves the total release of the contents of one 60,190 gallon chlorine storage tank.  The worst case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ? 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ? 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  Specifically, the EPA requires worst case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind, which would not disperse a release effectively. Further, the modeling requirements assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released instantaneously.  The chances of such an event occurring on a 98?F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely remote.  \nWorst case releases for the chlorine water treatment process were evaluated.  The evaluation was performed using B/AB and EPA's INPUFF Models.  (INPUFF was used as a chlorine dioxide release is not a dense gas.  That worst case had a significantly smaller distance to the endpoint than the release of 60,190 gallons of solution equivalent to 6,025 lbs. of chlorine dioxide.  Under the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill (for purposes of RMP) would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mill's property line.\n1.3.2.    ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nS. D. Warren developed alternative scenarios for chlorine and chlorine dioxide, which focus on more realistic releases occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modeling a release, which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the process hazard analyses (\"PHAs\") performed on covered processes, and all "

The leak of a chlorine dioxide transfer pipe from the R-8 unit storage tank that feeds the bleach plant.  The leak was estimated at 10% of the total liquid solution flow or 12,500 gallons of liquid per hour.\n\nEach of these release scenarios could result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mill's property line. \n1.4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)\nS. D. Warren's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the standard operating procedure for the facility.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chlorine-and chlorine dioxide specific actions within the site program.
