The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measrues to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case scenario is a liquid spill and vaporization casued by a loss of the contents of a 142,000 gallon tank containing 1% ClO2 solution.  This is a gas release of chlorine dioxide for 10 minutes.  The assumed weather conditions include a conservative temperature and relative humidity.  The estimated exposure distance is 5.53 miles.  controls are in lace to limit the offsite consequences of any release through pre-startup review, training, and onsite response personnel.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release of chlorine dioxide includes liquid spill of chlorine dioxide solution from a pipe leak and vaporization.  The pipe is 700 feet of 4\" pipe filled with 1% chlorine dioxide solution.  An estimated 38 pounds of ClO2 would be release under this scenario.  The release could impact an area 1.21 miles from the event.\n\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention porgrams.  These programs were developed for Process Safety Management (PSM) and include the requirements of the RMP plan.  These include:\n\n*  Process safety information\n*  Process hazard analysis\n*  Operating procedures\n*  Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n*  Management of change\n*  P"

The participation minimizes the consequences of releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Communication is encouraged between supervision and employees.  To promote safety, at a minimum, monthly departmental safety meetings are held.  In addition, to the meetings, a central safety committee with employee representation from all areas is held.  Five minute huddles are aslo used to communicate additional safety concerns.  Other forms of safety communication include near miss reporting, abnormal incident reports (AIR), and special training (emergency response, first aid, CPR, etc.).  Employees are always encouraged to speak to supervision about questions, suggestions, or comments concerning safety.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nA variety of process safety information is available concerning process chemicals and their uses.  MSDSs are available through most networked computers and the main guard house computer.  A hard copy is also available in the medical office.  The MSDSs are updated and any new chemical received into the mill must first undergo a new material check apporval signed by the environmental, safety, health, process, purchasing, and paper professional for FDA.  PSI notebooks containing pertainant operations, safety, and maintenance information is kept in various places throughout the mill.  SOPs supply additional information onsafety when performing a task.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANAYLSIS (PHA)\nProcess hazard analysis (PHA) are performed on the PSM/RMP chemicals used int eh mill.

Once a failure condition is known, the consequences of the failure is identified.\n\nThe PHAs are conducted by a team consisting of engineering, safety, environmental, maintenance, operations, and supervision.  The team identifies failures and their consequences.  The results are reviewed for the seriousness of the hazards and the most severe are performed first.\n\nthe reviews are updated at a minimum of every 5 years.  The updates are documented and reviewed for the recommendations and appropriate measures are taken.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe Kingsport Mill has standard operating proceudres (SOPs) which address the general purpose, operating equipment, objectives, safety considerations, normal operating parameters, troubleshooting and reference drawings for the process.\n\nThe purpose of the SOPs are to understand the correct procudres for a job or task.  SOPs are reviewed by operations and supervision for accuracy and understanding.  Special safety considerations are also presented in the SOPs.\n\nTRAINING\nAll new employees are required to have a general mill safety before their specific area safety training.  All safety training is documented and audited for completeness.  Procedureal training, on-the-job training, and testing on safety and process ability is also a mandatory part fo the training program.  Employees are also encouraged to participate in computerized training programs available at the mill.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\nWhenever process safety information is modified or added, a pre-startup safety review is conducted to ensure the safety of the modification or addition.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all significant accidnetal chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThe Kingsport mill has had only one accident in the last 5 years.  The accident was the result of a drain valve being left open after an outage.  The release entered our process sewer and vapors were noticed observed mainly at the primary clarifier as well as other process sewer vents throughout the sewer line.  Vapors did cross the property line along Industry Drive.  The National Response Center was notified of the release.  \n\nWe have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root cause of the events.  As a result, the lockout procedure has been revised.  An additional interlock for low pressure in the line from the ClO2 plant to the bleach plant has also been implemented. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning.  Our porgram provides the essential planning and tr"

Whenever maintenance personnel are required to work on PSM/RMP equipment, an overview of the process and the safety and health hazards are discussed witht he personnel along with applicable safe work practices.\n\nAnother part of the integrity program is the quality assurance of the material used in the repairs.  Unique PSM/RMP equipment is set up in a separate area of the storeroom and is used exclusively for the chlorine dioxide system.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nSafe work practices are encouraged and required at the Kingsport Mill.  Several safe work practice plans are enforced including lockout/tagout, control of entry and exit, hot work permits, fall protection, and confined space programs.  These procedures and training programs help ensure good safe work practices.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Kingsport Mill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all PSM/RMP processes.  The managment of change requires that changes to items such as process equipment, procedures and other changes be reviewed and documented (by participants signature) before initiation of the change.  The modifications are reviewed and documented to verify the new changes do not present a new hazard and that the controls not updated are still safe.  Also, any additional traiing needed for operations or maintenance is given and documented.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe Kingsport Mill investigates any incident or near miss incident that could have resulted in a fire or explosion, toxic release, property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury.  The intent of the investigations are to correct the situation or install additional safety factors so that the incident will not reoccur.  The outcome of the investigations are forwarded to specific individuals or departments for corrective actions to begin as soon as possible.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nCompliance audits are performed at least every 3 years.  The findings are documented and resolutions for th"

The overall emergency planning and training fore effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The overall emergency prodedure program is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes periodic meetings with local emergency personnel, government officials, and industry representatives.  Emergency personnel (fire depoartment, etc.) are available on a continous bais, either by phone or radio.  The ability to notify off site responders may therefore by performed very quickly.  In addition, the Kingsport Mill is located very close to the downtown fire hall.  in addition to committe meetings, off site personnel participate in emergency drills at the mill.  Local personnel are also involved in periodic refresher training (i.e., hazmat training, confined rescue training, etc.) performed at the mill.\n\nThe Kingsport mill has several accident prevention programs in place to help reduce the threat of a release.  Safety features are designed to contain or control a release, detect a release quickly, and reduce the impacts of a release.\n\nExamples of the features in place include: chlorine dioxide detectors with alarms, isolation valves, interlocks to shut down the process, redundant equipment and instrumentation, emergency procedure training (HAZWOPER, confined space rescue), and personal protective equipment (SCBA, protective clothing).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPORVE SAFETY\n\nOur facility is committed to preventing releases from the chlorine dioxide system.  The facility is considering the installation of more chlorine dioxide monitors in the building to indicate accidental release.  Also, we are improving housekeeping and building upkeep.  The facility is currently undergoing a modernization that will include the changes that have been done recently and new equipment that will continue to ma"
