Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at the Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  It is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  Substance 1 is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant. We have a total quantity of 86,964 lbs broken up into three smaller systems the first is Bldg. 1 with a total quantity of 22,805 lbs. The second is Bldg. 3 with a total of 45,183 lbs. The third system is Bldg. 4 with a total of 18,976 lbs. Substance 2 is Chlorine used for water treatment in our plant this substance is broken up into two systems the first is Bldg. 3 with 2,000 lbs. and the second is Bldg. 4 with 12,000 lbs. \r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 86,964 lbs.\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 14,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \r\n\r\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP cal"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nThe Grimmway Frozen Foods Inc. /Arvin Organics Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazop.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.   \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nFor the purposes of safely conduction activities within our covered processes, the Grimmway Arvin Facility maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  \r\n\r\nTraining: \r\nThe Grimmway Arvin Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating process equipment are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as necessary. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\nThe Grimmway Arvin Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks of process equipment to ensue proper operations.

The timing of their inspections follow the recommended guidelines available form the manufacturer, the International of Ammonia Refrigeration, and Chlorine Institute.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identifies by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change: \r\nWritten procedures are in place at the Grimmway Arvin Facility to manage changes in process chemical, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews:\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Grimmway Arvin Facility.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nGrimmway Arvin Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nGrimmway Arvin Facility promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
