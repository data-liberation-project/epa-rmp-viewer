We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Methylmethacrylate (MMA) using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Another part of the facility regenerates spent material for reintroduction into the MMA process.   In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nOleum is a cloudy, oily liquid with an acrid odor.  It is a mixutre of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide and is corrosive.  ICI Acrylics, Inc. uses oleum as a raw material i"

ICI is capable of storing 3,000,000 pounds of Oleum on site.\n\nFlammables\n\nTrimethylamine (TMA) is a colorless liquid under pressure, and has a fishy, ammoniaical odor.  It is used in chemical manufacturing and is flammable and corrosive.  ICI Acrylics uses TMA in the production of MMA.  ICI is capable of storing 70,000 of TMA pounds on site.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nRegulated Toxic Release Scenarios\n\nOleum Worst Case Scenario\n    *  Complete failure of tank system\n    *  Failure of all safety systems\n    *  Worst possible weather condition (no wind, low humidity)\n    *  Total release of the entire contents of tank \n    *  25 miles or greater distance of concern\n                     *  Impacted Public:  industrial, commercial, residential & environmental receptors\n\nOleum Alternative Case Scenario\n\n    *  Tank overfill during maintenance of secondary tank\n    *  Overfill interlock minimizes release\n    *  Average weather conditions\n    *  Total release of 1000 pounds of Oleum\n    *  Distance of concern - 0.48 miles\n    *  Impacted public - Other tenants of the Dupont Industrial Park \n\n    Accident Prevention In - Place\n                                           *  Dual Storage tank system with maximum total of both tanks not to exceed storage capacity of a single tank alone\n        *  Overfill and process control interlocks\n        *  Emergency shutdown procedures\n        *  Comprehensive process training programs for operations pe"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nICI keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Each incident of this type  is formally investigated to identify and correct the root cause of the event. \nThe EPA's definition of accidental release is one that results in death, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place or environmental damage.  \nThere have been no significant accidental chemical releases involving RMP chemicals at the Beaumont site in the past five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  \n\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true accurate, and com"
