Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Equity Group Eufaula Division has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n1.1.      Corporate Commitment to Safety\n\nEquity Group Eufaula Division is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining a\"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  We are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1.      It is the policy of Equity Group Eufaula Division to:\n\n1.1.1.1      Provide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2      Comply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3      Provide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy wor"

Encourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3.      Equity Group Eufaula Division?s aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials whereever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4.      Equity Group Eufaula Division has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.      The first duty of Equity Group Eufaula Division employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.

The substances regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that are located on site, in various locations and quantities, are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine gas.\n\n1.2.2.      Anhydrous ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration System.\".  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers and evaporators used throughout the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n \n1.2.3.      Chlorine is used at the facility for water treatment and sanitation. The gaseous chlorine is contained in cylinders located by the facility water supply wells.\n\n1.3.     Release Scenarios-Ammonia\n\n1.3.1.      As stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1) the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios involving the anhydrous ammonia process have been calculated. The results of those calculations are held on file at the Equity Group Eufaula facility.\n \n1.4.      Emergency Response Program\n\n1.4.1.      Equity Group Eufaula Division is equipped with an emergency information system.  Evacuation plans are placed throughout the facility to inform personnel in an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia, or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Equity Group Eufaula Division Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n1.4.2.      In addition to evacuation training, plant personnel have received emergency Hazmat training as outlined in OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\n1.4.3.

A block flow diagram of the process is on file in the engineering department office.\n\n6.1.3.      ThProcess 1 system used at Equity Group Eufaula Division is an enclosed loop mechanical process system that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a heat exchange media in the processing of the refrigerated food products.  There are no chemical reactions involving ammonia that occur. The principle involved is the ability of a refrigerant, in this case ammonia, to absorb heat as it changes state from a liquid to a gas, and to give up that heat as it changes back to a liquid.  The change in pressure levels required to accomplish this is supplied by the compressors.  The heat is absorbed in the cooling evaporators of various designs, and removed from the system by the condensers.  More detailed and specific descriptions of the process system are provided in the PSM manual.\nThe Process 2 chemical is chlorine gas which is injected as a controlled gas into the facility water supply for water treatment.\n\n6.1.4.

The relief valves will vent to atmosphere in the event of an overpressure situation within the vessel or associated process components. \n\n6.1.8.      In addition to the pressure relief valves, there are high-level shutdown devices configured to various pressure vessels within the process, which will shut down compressor operation in the event of an abnormal operating level in the process system vessels.\n\n6.1.9.      The ammonia room and roof top evaporator areas of the facility are equipped with ammonia detection sensors that activate alarms and ventilation fans in the event a pre-determined level of ammonia is released. \n\n6.1.10.
