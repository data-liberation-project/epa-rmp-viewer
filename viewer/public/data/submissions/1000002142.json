This Plan has been developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68, \u00c2\u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\u00c2\u00bf  The purpose of these provisions and this RMP is to prevent the accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause harm to the public and to the environment.\nThis RMP was originally developed by the Lynn Water Treatment Plant consultant, Tighe & Bond, Inc., specifically to prevent and mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and handling operations at the Lynn facility.  The RMP provides a summary of the risk management program implemented at the Lynn Water Treatment Plant and was developed following the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs guidance documents for the regulated chemicals.  The RMP is available to government agencies and the public for review.\nTighe & Bond has performed the requisite review and regulatory update necessary for covered facilities on their five year RMP Submission Anniversary.  This May 14, 2009 review included:\n\u00c2\u00bfA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the covered process using a methodology involving checklists developed from the EPA RMP Guidance, as well as a physical inspection of the covered process;\n\u00c2\u00bfPerformance of an off site consequence analysis (OCA) taking into account data revised from the year 2000 census; and\n\u00c2\u00bfA general review of operating and maintenance procedures with facility operations and environmental personnel.\nThe following items provide an overview of the Lynn Water Treatment Plant\u00c2\u00bfs RMP in accordance with 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n1.2\tFacility Description and Covered Process\nThe Lynn Water Treatment Plant is owned by the Lynn Water and Sewer Commission and operated by Veolia Water North America.

The chlorine is stored in a room equipped with ventilation and chlorine alarms.  \nThe Lynn Water Treatment Plant currently stores up to 32,000 pounds of chlorine in sixteen one-ton containers.  Since the Lynn Water Treatment Plant stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine, the facility is required to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  \n\n1.3\tRelease Scenarios\nA worst case release scenario and two alternative release scenarios were performed and documented in the original RMP filing.  These scenarios were re-calculated for the five year anniversary updating population and receptor information.  Based on guidelines provided by the EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\n\n1.4\tAdministrative and Engineering Controls\nThe Lynn Water Treatment Plant has implemented a prevention program (RMP Program 2) to administratively limit the potential for a worst case or alternative release.  No passive measures, however, were taken to minimize the impacts of these releases.  Specific measures employed in this program include safety reviews, hazard reviews, operating procedure reviews, training and maintenance and inspection.  These reviews are conducted, consistent with the operation of the covered process, once (1) every three (3) years in association with the Lynn Water Treatment Plant Compliance Audit (40 CFR 68.58) or with major changes.  The hazard review is required every five (5) years or with major changes.  Maintenance and inspection is conducted at specific intervals as outlined in the Lynn Water Treatment Plant\u00c2\u00bfs RMP.  The results of the most recent reviews are also maintained at the facility.\n\n1.5\tMitigation Measures\nCertain engineering controls are used to mitigate the potential effects of the alternative release scenarios and are listed in Section 8.4.d of the RMP submittal.\n\n1.6\tGeneral Accidental Prevention Progra"
