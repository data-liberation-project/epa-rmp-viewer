Our plant has operated safely since its initial startup in 1961 without a major incident affecting our community.\n\n\n\nIn our processes we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nOur facility uses two RMP-regulated chemicals, chlorine and phosphorous oxychloide, to produce our products.\n\n\n\nChlorine, which is purchased, is used at our site to produce benzyl chloride and is stored in and distributed from railroad tank cars. Chlorine is a gas at normal pressure and temperature, but is stored as a liquid under pressure in the tank cars. It is unloaded directly from the tank car into a steam-heated vaporizer, where it is heated to vaporize the liquid chlorine for use.\n\n\n\nFlammables:\n\n\n\nWe have no RMP-regulated flammables stored or handled at our facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including those incorporated into EPA, OSHA and New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act requirements:\n\n-Inventory Control to minimize the quantity that could be released in an accident.\n\n\n\n-Process Safety Information to ensure up-to-date parameters for safely operating the process.\n\n\n\n-Process Hazards Analysis to identify and correct potential safety problems.\n\n\n\n-Standard Operating Procedures which describe how to safely operate the process.\n\n\n\n-Training to ensure that operators and mechanics are qualified "
