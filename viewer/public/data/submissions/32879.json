We fall into the Program 2 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\n      We have liquid chlorine in quantities above the threshold quantity as specified in Section 68.115 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore must comply with the RMP program.  This program provides our facility with an integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazard posed by regulated substances.  Under this program, our facility has assessed and continues to assess hazards to determine how accidental releases can impact the public health and environment.   Because we are committed to the success of our written risk management program, we encourage all suggestions.  We strive for a comprehensive, integrated prevention system, which obtains clear understanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of our facility, as well as the general public.\n\n\n\n      The City of Independence Water Department?s Courtney Bend Water Treatment Facility has been treating well water at its current location since 1955.  The plant is located on the south side of the Missouri River, about 1/4 mile west of M-291 Highway.  The plant is capable of treating 42 million gallons of water per day.  Chemicals used to treat the well water are stored at the plant.  Liquid chlorine is stored in an elevated enclosed rack outside the operations building in 10 1-ton cylinders.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored inside the building in 150-pound cylinders, for a total of 2,250 pounds.  Our ammonia storage falls below the threshold quantity for 40 CFR Part 68.  Also used in the treatment process is lime (calcium oxide), which is stored inside the operations b"

Lime requires special handling due to its hydro-thermic nature, but is not listed on the EPA?s list of hazardous chemicals.  \n\n\n\n    Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n      The Water Department used RMP*Comp to determine the affected area of our worst-case and alternative release scenarios.   The results are outlined in RMP*Submit, and detailed information is kept at our facilities.\n\n\n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\n      We have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.  In addition, the Courtney Bend Water Treatment Plant has had no significant chlorine releases in its 50-year history.\n\n\n\n    Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n      As stated previously, our emergency response plan was developed with assistance from our City of Independence Emergency Management Coordinator, and several local fire departments.  Trained water plant staff members will respond to small chlorine releases, such as a leak in piping.  In the unlikely event of a major chlorine release (such as a ruptured ton container), emergency response personnel will be contacted.  Sugar Creek, Independence, and Kansas City Fire Departments will respond as needed.  In such a case, water department trained staff will be available to provide assistance as needed.  Provisions are made for notifying the public, as may be appropriate.\n\n\n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n      Although the water plant has not had a major chlorine release in its history, we have made significant improvements to enhance our plant safety since the last RMP submittal in 1999.  An enclosure and scrubber system is now in place for chlorine storage.  This enclosure has increased plant worker safety, and reduced our potential area of impact under both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  The scrubber includes both the storage area and the liquid chlorine feed lines under the rack and the evaporator area.\n\n\n\n       The City of Independence Wa"
