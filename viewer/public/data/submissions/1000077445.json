If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Linde facility located in White City, Oregon is a specialty gas manufacturing, distribution and storage facility. The primary operation is the storage and distribution of Boron Trichloride, Boron Trifluoride, Chlorine, Hydrogen Fluoride and Trichlorosilane. Boron Trichloride is received and stored in 1,200 pound containers. The product is purified and filled into cylinders for shipment to customer sites. Boron Trifluoride is received and stored in 70 pound cylinders. The product is purified and filled into cylinders for shipment to customer sites. Chlorine is received and stored in 1,900 pound containers. The product is purified and filled into cylinders for shipment to customer sites. Hydrogen Fluoride is received and stored in 900 pound containers. The product is purified and filled into cylinders for shipment to customer sites. Trichlorosilane is received and stored in a 40,000 pound ISO container. The product is purified and filled into containers for shipment to customer sites.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThe total inventory of each of the following chemicals at the White City facility exceeds the threshold quantity established in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations:\n\n\n\n1.  Boron Trichloride\n\n2.  Boron Triflouride\n\n3.  Chlorine   \n\n4.  Hydrogen Flouride \n\n3.

The plan includes the actions and responsibilities for employees and site emergency responders in the event of an emergency to ensure the safety of our employees, contractors, and the community. The plan also includes pre-planning, drills and critiques to ensure the site is prepared to respond to an emergency.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the White City facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accident releases of Boron Trichloride, Boron Trifluoride, Chlorine, Hydrogen Fluoride and Trichlorosilane. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n\n\n - Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control the substances and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems\n\n\n\n - Procedures and programs to develop, maintain and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation and contractor activity\n\n\n\n - Initial and periodic review of new or modified processes through application of comprehensive design safety and management of change programs that include Process Ha"

Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements. They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program is audited a minimum of every 3 years by our internal audit team to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAtmospheric monitors for Boron Trichloride, Boron Trifluoride, Chlorine, Hydrogen Fluoride and Trichlorosilane are in place to detect leaks as a part of the plant's life safety system. This system is designed to stop the transfer of chemicals in the event of a leak.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe White City facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the past five years. There were no covered process releasees that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nThe White City facility has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public and the environment. The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a chemical release. The plan complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and was coordinated with local emergency response agencies. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan prior to commencement of work annually.
