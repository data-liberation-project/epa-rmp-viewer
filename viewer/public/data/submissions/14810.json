      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nExecutive Summary\nGeneral\n\tThe Northampton Borough Municipal Authority (NBMA) owns and operates a  potable water treatment system and distribution system for the Borough of Northampton, Pennsylvania, and surrounding communities.  The water treatment plant located at 5880 Roosevelt Street, Whitehall, PA, 18052 processes up to 6.0 million gallons per day of water drawn from the Lehigh River and Spring Mill Dam to yield potable water.  Treatment processes include pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorine disinfection.  This plan addresses chlorine used in the treatment process.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, all year.\n\tThe water treatment plant includes a chlorine storage room, which contains up to four one-ton cylinders (8,000 pounds) of chlorine liquified under pressure, a hoist, scale(s), vacuum regulators and a gas detector/alarm unit.  A chlorine feed room is located adjacent to this storage room and has a pre, post and spare chlorinator.  The chlorination system uses remote-vacuum-actuated feed lines and has vacuum regulators attached directly to the chlorine container gas valves, mitigating against high-pressure gas releases through the chlorinator system.  Water treatment operators regularly check the room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the feed rate as necessary.  \nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\n\tThe off-site consequence analysis includes two chlorine release scenarios, one \"worst-case\" and one \"alternative-case.\"  The first scenario is defined by the regulations as the \"maximum quantity in the largest vessel\" being released \"as a gas over ten minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative-case scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\"\n\tAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed using the RMP*Comp program distributed by the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office of the EPA.

The off-site consequence analysis was performed under the prescribed EPA conditions of all volume released as gas within a ten minute period, to an ERPG-2 endpoint radius of 3.00 miles according to the RMP*Comp model.  Within the 28.3 square-mile area bounded by this circle reside 28475 people who may potentially be affected by the release.\n\tThe alternative-case scenario chosen involves a leak from a faulty gasket installation between the ton container and the vacuum regulator.  The RMP*Comp model was run assuming a 10 minute duration release at 0.5 pounds per minute, which yielded a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles and an impacted area of twenty acres surrounding the facility.  The meteorological conditions used were taken from the Guidance to be stability class D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  Approximately 30 people would be affected by this release.\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\tThe Northampton Borough Municipal Authority's water treatment plant accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n\t1.\tHigh level of training for the operators.\n\t2.\tPreventati"

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills will be conducted with the fire companies, and the operation and response procedures will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\nPlanned Facilities to Improve Safety\n\tFacilities to improve safety (recommended actions) were made following a May 5, 1999, inspection of the disinfection systems by the consulting engineer.  These recommendations included additional signage, vent line modifications, high temperature alarm in storage room, egress provisions and ventilation modifications.  To comply with local codes, it is also recommended to install a fire suppression system and chlorine scrubber system."
