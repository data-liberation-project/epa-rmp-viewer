(Lang Ice) facility located at 3600 West 59th Street in Chicago, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n? Introduction;\n? Lang Ice Company policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n? Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; \n? Emergency Communications;\n? Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n? Planned changes to improve safety; and\n? Management Program\n\nII. Lang Ice Company Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Lang Ice Company; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Lang Ice Company is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Lang Ice Company?s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This updated risk management plan is being submitted to comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 requirements to submit a risk management plan, every five (5) years.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result"

Facility Identification\nThe Lang Ice Company facility is located at 3600 West 59th Street in Chicago, Illinois.  The facility is a producer, distributor, and retailer of ice for the Chicagoland area.  \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 312113. Ammonia refrigeration is used at the facility to make and store ice.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule.  The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 20,000 pounds.\n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. An area map is included as Appendix B. \n\nIV. Hazard Assessment ? Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worse case release scenario. \n\nV. Hazard Assessment ? Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAppendix C consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix E consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\nVI. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.
