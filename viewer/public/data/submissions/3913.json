Employees attend safety meetings, which are held about 6 times per month to provide ample opportunities for employees to attend. All meetings throughout the company (other than safety meetings) must begin with a safety topic to increase safety awareness and employee involvement.

These methods are designed to help knowledgeable employees recognize process hazards.

Operating procedures are available from document control department and control rooms where operators work.\n\n\n5.5\tTraining\n\nSafety training is conducted monthly and the topics change each month. Process safety topics are covered during several months of the year.  Initial training is provided to new employees.  Experienced operators train new employees on the proper operating procedures until they believe from direct observation that the newer employee is ready to run the process. Refresher training is conducted periodically.\n\n5.6\tContractors\n\nThe Harahan Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased construction or maintenance activities.  Contractor's safety performance is reviewed before hiring the contractors.  Contractors are given safety training prior to being allowed to work in the plant to help assure that our safety procedures are followed. A permit system is in place, which requires contractors to obtain written approval in the form of a work permit from knowledgeable Plant personnel before work by a contractor commences on a regulated process.  Contractors are informed of the process hazards before written approval to commence work is given.\n\n5.7\tPre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR before any new or modified process is operated to make sure that the new or modified facilities and the associated procedures are safe to use for operation. \n\n5.8\tMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility has an ongoing system to maintain the process equipment in good worki"

Automatic shut off valves prevent the oxide from being added unless the process conditions are safe. Leak sensors provide alarms if leaks are detected and deluge systems are provided for tank unloading area to absorb leaks.  Dikes are provided for the storage tanks to contain spills and leaks.  All of the vessels are protected with self-closing relief valves and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere. \n\n\n7.

As part of this commitment, Witco Corporation has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of chemical processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that is required by the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements (RMP Rule) in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan), which describes the risk management programs at the facility for review by the USEPA and the public.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWitco Corporation is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors, the public and the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the unlikely event of a significant accidental release our personnel will respond to control and contain the releases.  In most foreseeable circumstances releases could be controlled by shutting down operations and/or by applying generous quantities of water to absorb and dilute the release since all of the regulated chemicals are water soluble. If necessary, Witco will evacuate onsite personnel and contact the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department and police to help handle the emergency and to help warn the public.\n\n3. Facility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Harahan Plant stores regulated substances for use in two chemical processes. In each process the regulated substances are chemically transformed into less hazardous products. The oxylation processes make products that are used as ingredients in detergents for laundry and personal care, and additives used in the agricultural and petroleum industries.\n\nThe following is a list of the"

The OCA consists of evaluating both the worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for releases of regulated substances.  The worst case scenario is not expected to occur over the life of the facility.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might be a reasonable scenario to consider for emergency planning purposes.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public if an accidental release should happen. This distance is called the endpoint. \n\n4.1\tWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Ethylene Oxide is the release of the entire contents from a 25,600 gallon railcar in 10 minutes, which is the worst case scenario defined by the USEPA. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is approximately 9.9 miles.  The population within this 9.9-mile radius of the plant is approximately 669,000 people.\n\nThe USEPA models were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n4.2\tAlternative Toxic Release Scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenarios for all of the toxic substances were assumed to be leaks with no steps taken to mitigate the release. Water sprays onto leaks should be highly effective in knocking down vapors to reduce the impact of the leak since all of the regulated chemicals are water-soluble.\n\nFor ethylene oxide, the distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.3 miles.
