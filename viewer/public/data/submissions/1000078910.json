This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release should occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also an active member of the Kanawha Putnam Emergency Planning Committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Institute Site is a manufacturing facility that annually produces many specialty chemical products for UCC. Most products are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products. \n\n\n\nThere are currently 3 RMP regulated substances present in 35 covered processes at the site. UCC handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the Institute site:\n\nEthylene Oxide\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nEthylenediamine\n\n\n\nMaximum threshold inventory quantities of ethylene oxide have decreased for RMP Processes at Institute due to  deregistration of the Cellosize (Process ID # 1000059210) in 2017 and POLYOX WaterSolubleResins (Process ID # 1000059211), for which ownership has changed to DuPont in 2019.  No other previous maximum threshold quantities have been revised "

This has not changed from the 2014 RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Institute Site remains unchanged from the 2014 RMP submittal, with exception of changing the quantity of ethylene oxide released from 180,000 lb to 184,000 lb.  This is due to discussions with operations that current cars on site have as much as 182,000 pounds and that 184,000 pounds is conservative.   An additional public receptor was added to include churches which are within the distance to endpoint for the worst-case scenario and checked the box for toxic worst case scenario to include National or State Parks, Forests or Monuments for the inclusion of Kanawha State Forest, which is within this distance. This change did not result in an increased distance to endpoint, but rather due to improved mapping tools. \n\n\n\nChanges were made to Section 1 to reflect changes in Owner or Operator, person responsible for RMP implementation, Emergency Contact, Parent Company web site address, and number of fulltime equivalent employees on site.  Also, a change was made to the longitude and latitude coordinates from a central location to the plant entrance.\n\n\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario and flammable alternate worst case scenario for POLYOX was removed from the plan, as UCC no longer owns the POLYOX plant.  No other flammable scenarios exist within UCC ownership on site.\n\n\n\nSection 7, Program numbers 3 and 5 for CELLOSIZE and POLYOX, respectively, have been removed per discussion above. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nUCC facilities at the Institute site have had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no significant releases with offsite impact as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUnion Carbide's gene"

Examples include, but are not limited to,\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals, equipment design specification sheets, and reactive chemicals test results. This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses may include: Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPs), Reactive\n\nChemical/Process Hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection\n\nAnalyses.
