It is the policy of the facility management to implement the requirements of this ER Plan by managing and operating the facility in accordance with the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations and general good operating practices. The objective is to minimize the risk of a fire or an accidental hazardous material release. The ERP and EAP was developed to ensure fast and efficient response in case of an emergency situation.  The ERP and EAP identifies the emergency response organization, the procedures for notification and evacuation, and emergency preparedness and planning.  USCS has coordinated services with a number of government and community agencies which would respond to an emergency, such as the state and local police or fire departments, the ambulance squad, state and county emergency response officials, and an area hospital.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nUSCS is committed to maintaining a safe and efficient ammonia refrigeration system. Part of this commitment is maintaining and operating the system in accordance with the principles and\r\nrequirements of the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP plans. United States Cold Storage has no major changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration system at this time. However, the system is subject to periodic audits and process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing practical improvements to provide a safer system."
