Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBridgeport Energy LLC is a natural gas fired electric generating facility.  Aqueous \n\nammonia is used for emissions control (NOx).  By virtue of the toxic effects associated \n\nwith ammonia, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling the \n\nchemical in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to personnel \n\nat Bridgeport Energy, and to reduce the threat to nearby community members.  \n\nBridgeport Energy is strongly committed to employee and public safety and to the \n\nenvironment.  Safety at the facility depends, among other factors, upon the manner in \n\nwhich aqueous ammonia is stored and handled.   Equipment design, comprehensive \n\noperation and response procedures, and periodic training received by plant operators add \n\nto the inherent safety of ammonia storage and use at the facility.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAqueous ammonia is the only chemical used or stored at the Bridgeport Energy facility \n\nthat is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention regulations (40 CFR 68) because it is \n\nstored above the threshold amount and concentration.  As such, this Risk Management \n\nPlan (RMP) only addresses aqueous ammonia.  As part of this RMP, worst case and \n\nalternative release scenarios have been evaluated and a prevention program developed.  \n\nComplete documentation of the program elements is maintained at the site.\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is delivered directly to the ammonia storage tanks.  Access to the \n\nBridgeport Energy facility and, therefore, to the tanks is restricted to authorized personnel \n\nand third-party contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of aqueous ammonia that is stored in the ammonia tanks is \n\napproximately 254,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n                                               "

The containment dike around each \n\ntank is large enough to hold the entire contents of the tank.  In addition, these dikes drain \n\nto an underground containment pit which greatly reduces the exposed surface area and \n\nthe potential quantity of vapor release.   \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a break in the transfer hose during tank truck \n\noffloading operations resulting in a release of ammonia to the truck unloading \n\ncontainment and the tank containment and pit.  This alternative release scenario does \n\nconsider that this operation is monitored by both the truck driver and plant personnel and \n\nassumes more realistic meteorological conditions.  \n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific \n\nPrevention Steps\n\n\n\nBridgeport Energy has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental \n\nrelease prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly \n\ndescribe the release prevention program that is in place at the site:\n\n\n\nSafety \n\nBridgeport Energy has detailed, written safety procedures which describe the chemical \n\nhazards, equipment design standards, and operational controls associated with all aspects \n\nof the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\nA process hazards analysis was conducted using the What-If Checklist methodology.  \n\nThis analysis focused on operating procedures, equipment design and function, and \n\nhandling practices to identify potential hazards.  An analysis was originally conducted in \n\n1999 and was reviewed and updated in 2002.  Both analyses were conducted by qualified \n\npersonnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations.  All findings relative to these \n\nanalyses were addressed in a timely m"

These procedures address various modes of \n\noperation such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency \n\nshutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  This \n\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to the operators involved in \n\nthe process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBridgeport Energy has a comprehensive training and operator qualification program in \n\nplace to ensure that all employees engaged in the operation of the plant are competent in \n\nall operating procedures.
