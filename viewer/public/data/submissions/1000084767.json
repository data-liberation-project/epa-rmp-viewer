These precautions include safety controls (alarms and\n\nautomatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially\n\nunsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also\n\nhave a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of\n\nthe systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by\n\nqualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel\n\nto respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and\n\nthe surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire\n\ncodes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate. In\n\naccordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n\n(29CFR1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40CFR68) our priority is to\n\nprevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to\n\nproblems.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.\n\n\n\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility. This program\n\ncontains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other\n\nemergencies, including evacuation procedures and instructions for con"
