We are strongly committed to safety by maintaining comprehensive maintenance, prevention, and industrial safety programs that protect against any accidental release or spill which may result in on- or off-site consequences.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a mishap, an emergency response plan has been developed in cooperation with the Sumter County Civil Defense Agency, which serves to ensure the safety and well being of the community and the environment.  Our emergency response program is based upon the recommendations by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. within the \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"       \n\nFacility Description\n\nChlorine is stored on-site for use in the disinfection process of treated wastewater prior to final discharge.  Six 2,000-pound pressurized chlorine cylinders are located within an enclosed building south of the treatment ponds for use in the treatment process.  Three additional 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  Four 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide cylinders are stored on-site for use in the dechlorination process.   The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage areas to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment failure.            \n\nAccident History\n\nThe Pocotaligo Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental release over the past 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred or were identified within the time period in question.  Since the facility has been in operation, no deaths or injuries have resulted from the accidental release, explosion, or fire involving this regulated substance.  Furthermore, no fish kills "

Details for each chosen scenario has been provided in the following paragraphs.\n \nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as developed for the chlorination system, involves a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from one of the six chlorine cylinders within the chlorine building that are connected to the chlorination process.  It has been assumed that the entire quantity of chlorine is released as a gas over a 10 minute time frame as a result of a tank rupture.  Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 3.0 miles corresponds to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.  Industrial facilities, schools, hospitals, recreational areas, residential subdivisions, creeks, and rivers would be affected by such a release.    \n\nAn alternative scenario may include the catastrophic release of chlorine gas during 3 m/s windspeeds, D Class atmospheric stability, and  77 degrees fahrenheit weather conditions.  It has been assumed that a quantity of chlorine gas is released at a rate of 3.3 pounds per minute from the storage cylinders as a result of a pipe rupture within the chlorination building.  The facility's hazard response team would control the release by preventing flow through the piping within a 60 minute period.  Under the alternative weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles corresponds to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l. No residential subdivisions would be affected by such a release.  Environmental receptors exposed to chlorine concentrations above the 0.0087 mg/l level include creeks and rivers.  \n\nSulfur Dioxide\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as "

Information includes the chemical hazards, operating procedures, and equipment design parameters.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis\nThe \"What-If/Checklist\" hazard analysis method is utilized at the Sumter, South Carolina facility to identify and prevent any activity that may result in a release of a regulated substance.  A team of qualified personnel perform periodic reviews of operating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify potential hazards every three years, or in the event of any process or equipment change.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n4. Operating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures addressing initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, and  emergency operations have been developed to ensure the safe operation of the covered processes.\n\n5.
