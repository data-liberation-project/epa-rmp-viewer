The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE  FACILITY 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE  FACILITY is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed"

The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\n\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

The five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents or accidents at the facility that meet the threshold for reporting for to the EPA in the past five (5) years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE FACILITY is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE  FACILITY to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of BEN E. KEITH - ALBUQUERQUE  FACILITY employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\n\n10"

This yielded and estimated population of 905 persons in the level of concern radius.  It is noted that there are no residences within the level of concern radius (and as a result, could be no persons affected).  It is assumed that a Census data block point must be located withing that radius.  It is unlikely that the accurate number of residents within the level of concern radius is 0.\n\n"
