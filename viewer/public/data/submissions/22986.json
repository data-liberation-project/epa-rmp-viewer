Only employees who have completed training for authorization to work on the chlorine system will be allowed in the chlorine room.  Annual inspections will be done on the hoist mechanism to ensure proper structural and operational parameters.  The hoists will be visually inspected monthly.  Twice annual inspections and PMs will be done on the chemical delivery system.  This work will be tracked in the Somax maintenance computer system.
