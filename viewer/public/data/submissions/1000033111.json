The terminal has a mission to provide the highest quuality service to customers while maintaining a safe workplace and protecting the environment.  The terminal is proactive in achieving these goals.  The terminal policy is to prevent releases before they happen and to provide the appropriate level of emergency response should an accidental release or other emergency occurs.\n\n1.2 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nIMTT-Bayonne terminal requires an RMP because it stores one compound in excess of the RMP threshold quantities as identified in the Federal Register, January 31, 1994.  These include the following:\n\nButane - Railcar unloading racks and operations in Yard 4 and 6\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) had included butane (since March 2010) in the requirements of the TCPA Program..\n\n1.3 WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n1.4 ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n1.5 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIMTT-Bayonne maintains a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  For all materials handled on site along with the regulated substances, safety information is maintained regarding the materials, tanks and associated equipment. Hazard analysis have been carried out for the regulated processes.\n\nOperating proceedures including ISO 9000 procedures and work instructions are followed in all loading and unloading operations.  IMTT-Bayonne operators are trained in the procedures and receive additional safety training.\n\nIMTT-Bayonne maintains an extensive maintenance facility and providses continued inspection and maintenance of tanks and loading and unloading systems at the terminal.\n\nIncidents are tracked through an incident invistigation program"
