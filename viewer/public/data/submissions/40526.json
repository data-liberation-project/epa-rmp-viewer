Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe management, and employees of the City of Manteca, Wastewater Quality Control Facilities, 2450 West Yosemite Avenue facility (herein referred to as the Facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of chlorine, and sulfur dioxide.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the treatment of municipal sewage and the subsequent discharge for irrigation or to public waterways, of treated water.\n\nChlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas are received, stored, and distributed within the plant for treatment of processed waters prior to discharge to the San Joaquin River.  The chlorine serves to disinfect the water and the sulfur dioxide neutralizes excess chlorine present after a prescribed residence time.  Neither gas is used when treated water is utilized for irrigation. \n\nChlorine is received by truck, packaged in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 20,000 pounds, 10 cylinders (Figure 3).\n\nSulfur dioxide is received by truck, packaged in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide stored at this facility is 14,000 pounds, 7 cylinders (Figure 3).\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn compliance with the 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations to the Clean Air Act, the description covering the worst-case release scenario has been eliminated from the executive summary.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nChlorine: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the California Code of "
