It is PM Windom\u00c2\u00bfs policy to design and operate a safe facility.  This is accomplished through the experience and training of our personnel.  Our emergency plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and potentially affected neighbors.  Employees are trained to handle minor leaks. \n\nSource and Regulated Substances\nAmmonia is the only regulated chemical that is onsite in quantities above the risk management program thresholds.  PM Windom uses ammonia for refrigeration.  Under normal temperature and pressure conditions, ammonia is a gas.  However, in part of the refrigeration process, ammonia is liquefied under pressure.  Refrigeration (or cooling) in the various meat coolers and freezers is accomplished through evaporation of ammonia.  Compressors are used to compress the ammonia gas.  Condensers are used to condense the ammonia gas to a liquid.  The cycle is repeated.  PM Windom installed the ammonia process in 1996.  Major process equipment in the process includes five compressors, two evaporative condensers, a high pressure receiver (HPR), two low pressure receivers (LPR), and cooler/freezer units.  The ammonia system capacity is 15,000 pounds.  The typical inventory for ammonia is 12,000 pounds. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nConsistent with regulatory requirements for this process, the worst-case release is based on the maximum capacity of a single vessel.  The worst-case release quantity for PM Windom is the maximum amount that could be held in the high pressure liquid receiver.  The maximum capacity"

      "SummaryText": "of the receiver (13,000 pounds of ammonia) is assumed to be released over a time frame of 10 minutes.  No controls or mitigation were considered for the worst case release of ammonia.  There are relatively few buildings or trees in the vicinity of the process so rural topography was assumed.  The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 2.0 miles.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\nThe alternate release scenario for the ammonia process assumes a compressor seal fails thus releasing ammonia.  The alternate release has an estimated release rate of 1.25 pounds per minute.  The release occurs under typical conditions (including wind speed).  This release is assumed to occur over a 30-minute period and has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAdministrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\nPM Windom has policies and procedures in place to decrease the likelihood of an ammonia release event and to minimize the consequence if there is a release. Operators are trained in the proper usage and handling of these chemicals.  The process area has an ammonia gas detector which will signal an alarm on the computer and audible alarm.\n\nGeneral Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\nThe ammonia process complies with both the EPA prevention program level 3 requirements and the OSHA PSM requirements. The facility is operated according to manufacturer recommendations and International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration recommendations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPM Windom has not had any releases from this ammonia process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe emergency action plan has been coordinated with the Windom Fire Department."
