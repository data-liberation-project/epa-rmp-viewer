The USAG requires the installation support contractor to train its employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.

This circular distance to the toxic endpoint was used to evaluate the offsite impacts. \r\n4.2 Chlorine Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\r\nThe alterative release scenario (ARS) depicts a more likely release scenario that could occur compared to the WRS.  For WTP 1, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of chlorine gas from a 1/16-inch-diameter pinhole leak in the valve on the chlorine container, a likely scenario, for a release time of 60 minutes.  This scenario was selected during the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted for WTP 1.  Only one ARS was evaluated for WTP 1.

The Risk Management Program Team designated in the USAG's WTP 1 RMP was assembled from a group of individuals, each with highly specialized expertise in one or many areas.  \r\n\r\n7.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe USAG's accident prevention program for WTP 1, which includes the chlorine process, consists of the 13 elements summariz"

This information includes chlorine background information, MSDSs, and chlorine reaction chemistry.  The safety information was reviewed in October 2015 during an annual RMP compliance evaluation/inspection and is still current.  No updates were required.\r\n7.2 Equipment Safety Information\r\nEquipment safety information was compiled for the chlorine process. Specifications for each process were collected and maintained in a location for easy reference and includes details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and pertinent details of the chlorinators and chlorine leak detectors.  Codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the water treatment plant facility.  Up-to-date equipment safety information is maintained as long as the equipment is in use at the USAG's WTP 1.\r\n\r\n7.3 Process Hazard Analysis\r\nA detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted with plant operations personnel, engineering, and administrative staff for the regulated process.  The PHA technique used was a what-if scenario and a hazard review checklist, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA.  The PHA was led by a person knowledgeable about the type of process being reviewed and was conducted during May 2014.  This document is on file at the facility and will be reviewed and updated as required within a 5-year period or whenever a major change occurs in the process.  If there have not been any major changes in the process, no updates will be necessary and this information will be stated in the WTP 1 five-year update.  A list of actions to resolve any significant process hazard analysis findings at WTP 1 was prepared for resolution.  The USAG and install"

      "SummaryText": "WTP 1 RMP Executive Summary\r\n\r\n1.0 Introduction\r\nThis executive summary provides an overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and associated policies for the U.S. Army Garrison - Redstone's (hereinafter referred to as the U.S. Army Garrison's [USAG's]) Water Treatment Plant (WTP) 1. \r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission is an update to the WTP 1 RMP that the U.S. Army Garrison - Redstone submitted to EPA in January 2011.  As requested by EPA, the USAG prepared and submitted a separate RMP to EPA for WTP 3 due to the distance separating it from WTP 1.  This RMP complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, under Section 112 (r) of the CAA Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68, also known as the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  \r\nThe chlorination system at WTP 1 uses chlorine gas that is fed from 1-ton liquid containers.  Chlorine is the only chemical used at the USAG's WTP 1 that is subject to the RMP Rule; therefore, it is the only process examined at this facility under the RMP Rule.  This document summarizes the USAG's WTP 1 Risk Management Plan's health and safety programs, policies, procedures, and ongoing actions of the internal management and incident response team that are designed to prevent or minimize the health and environmental impacts of accidental releases of chlorine at this facility.  To date, the USAG has had an accident-free record of chlorine usage and storage at WTP 1, which is attributable to the safety of the process and the focus on employees training in safety, proper operating procedures, effective maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures. \r\nThe USAG has contracted the operation of WTP 1 to a private installation support contractor (Wolf Creek Federal Services, Inc.).  The personnel employed by this contractor operate and maintain the chlorination system at WTP 1; and the installation support contractor's employees are required to comply with the contracto"

The USAG has implemented extensive safety precautions and has a Fire Department with well trained and fully equipped Hazmat personnel.  The USAG has in place proactive procedures for improving and maintaining the safety of WTP 1 operations by using reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include leak detectors with alarms; awareness training programs for installation and contractor's personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; plus program to evaluate potential hazards associated with the operations at WTP 1.  The USAG requires the installation support contractor operating WTP 1 to use personnel trained in the operation of the chlorine storage and chlorination system/equipment. \r\nIn the event of an accidental release of hazardous chlorine, the installation support contractor personnel is required to notify the USAG's Fire Department immediately by calling 911 and then evacuate the area to a safe distance from the release incident.  The USAG's Fire Department personnel will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that is safe for personnel working in the area and to help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment.  The USAG provides response training to its personnel and to the installation support contractor's personnel upon request, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Fire Department.\r\n\r\n3.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\r\nThe USAG's WTP 1 is located on the southwest"

      "SummaryText": "border of Redstone Arsenal which is located in Madison County, Alabama.  WTP 1 draws raw water from the Tennessee River and treated/purified it to domestic potable water standards in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The raw water is pre-treated with chlorine, pumped into the flocculation/sedimentation basins, and filtered through four rapid sand filters to remove fine particles of clay, silt, and bacteria.  The filtered water is then treated again with chlorine and diverted into a 250,000 clearwell before it is finally pumped into the distribution system.  WTP 1 has a capacity to produce 2.6 million gallons per day (mgd) of potable water with an average flow of 1.3 mgd during normal operation.  WTP 1 also produces an average of 2.4 mgd of industrial water\r\nThe USAG's WTP 1 currently stores a maximum of four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine for a total storage capacity of 8,000 pounds.  The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the 1-ton chlorine containers during the chlorination process to kill bacteria that may be present in the raw water.  The chlorine storage at WTP 1 exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 2,500 pounds listed in the RMP Rule.  The USAG's WTP 1 has had no accidental releases of chlorine that led to an offsite impact in the last 5 years.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for WTP 1 chlorination process is 22131, but this process is not covered under the RMP Rule.  However, the chlorine storage at WTP 1 is subject to the OSHA PSM standard; and therefore, they are considered as Program Level 3 processes.  \r\n\r\n4.0 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis as required by the RMP Rule.  No changes have been required since the USAG's WTP 1 January 2011 submission.\r\n4.1 Chlorine Hazard Assessment A Worst-case Scenario\r\nFor the worst-case release scenario (WRS) at WTP 1, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of the entire contents of the"
