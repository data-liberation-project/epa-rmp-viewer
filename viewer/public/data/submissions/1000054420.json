As requested by EPA, the USAG prepared and submitted a separate RMP to EPA for WTP 3 due to the distance separating it from WTP 1.  This RMP complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, under Section 112 (r) of the CAA Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68, also known as the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  \n\nThe chlorination system at WTP 1 uses chlorine gas that is fed from 1-ton liquid containers.  Chlorine is the only chemical used at the USAG's WTP 1 that is subject to the RMP Rule; therefore, it is the only process examined at this facility under the RMP Rule.  This document summarizes the USAG's WTP 1 Risk Management Plan's health and safety programs, policies, procedures, and ongoing actions of the internal management and incident response team that are designed to prevent or minimize the health and environmental impacts of accidental releases of chlorine at this facility.  To date, the USAG has had an accident-free record of chlorine usage and storage at WTP 1, which is attributable to the safety of the process and the focus on employees training in safety, proper operating procedures, effective maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThe USAG has contracted the operation of WTP 1 to a private installation support contractor (Wolf Creek Federal Services, Inc.).  The personnel employed by this contractor operate and maintain the chlorination system at WTP 1; and the installation support contractor's employees are required to comply with the contracto"

The USAG has implemented extensive safety precautions and has a Fire Department with well trained and fully equipped Hazmat personnel.  The USAG has in place proactive procedures for improving and maintaining the safety of WTP 1 operations by using reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include leak detectors with alarms; awareness training programs for installation and contractor's personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; plus program to evaluate potential hazards associated with the operations at WTP 1.  The USAG requires the installation support contractor operating WTP 1 to use personnel trained in the operation of the chlorine storage and chlorination system/equipment. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release of hazardous chlorine, the installation support contractor personnel is required to notify the USAG's Fire Department immediately by calling 911 and then evacuate the area to a safe distance from the release incident.  The USAG's Fire Department personnel will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that is safe for personnel working in the area and to help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment.  The USAG provides response training to its personnel and to the installation support contractor's personnel upon request, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Fire Department.\n\n\n\n3.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe USAG's WTP 1 is located on the southwest"

      "SummaryText": " border of Redstone Arsenal which is located in Madison County, Alabama.  WTP 1 draws raw water from the Tennessee River and treated/purified it to domestic potable water standards in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  The raw water is pre-treated with chlorine, pumped into the flocculation/sedimentation basins, and filtered through four rapid sand filters to remove fine particles of clay, silt, and bacteria.  The filtered water is then treated again with chlorine and diverted into a 250,000 clearwell before it is finally pumped into the distribution system.  WTP 1 has a capacity to produce 2.6 million gallons per day (mgd) of potable water with an average flow of 1.3 mgd during normal operation.  WTP 1 also produces an average of 2.4 mgd of industrial water\n\nThe USAG's WTP 1 currently stores a maximum of four 1-ton cylinders of chlorine for a total storage capacity of 8,000 pounds.  The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the 1-ton chlorine containers during the chlorination process to kill bacteria that may be present in the raw water.  The chlorine storage at WTP 1 exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 2,500 pounds listed in the RMP Rule.  The USAG's WTP 1 has had no accidental releases of chlorine that led to an offsite impact in the last 5 years.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for WTP 1 chlorination process is 22131, but this process is not covered under the RMP Rule.  However, the chlorine storage at WTP 1 is subject to the OSHA PSM standard; and therefore, they are considered as Program Level 3 processes.  \n\n\n\n4.0 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis as required by the RMP Rule.  No changes have been required since the USAG's WTP 1 January 2011 submission.\n\n4.1 Chlorine Hazard Assessment A Worst-case Scenario\n\nFor the worst-case release scenario (WRS) at WTP 1, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of the entire contents of the"

The maximum distance to the Risk Management Program toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm, was determined using EPA's RMP Comp&reg; model.  This circular distance to the toxic endpoint was used to evaluate the offsite impacts. \n\n4.2 Chlorine Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alterative release scenario (ARS) depicts a more likely release scenario that could occur compared to the WRS.  For WTP 1, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of chlorine gas from a 1/16-inch-diameter pinhole leak in the valve on the chlorine container, a likely scenario, for a release time of 60 minutes.  This scenario was selected during the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted for WTP 1.  Only one ARS was evaluated for WTP 1.  The chlorine release rate was calculated using EPA's RMP Comp&reg; model and used to evaluate the offsite impacts.\n\n\n\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nNo chlorine releases have occurred at the USAG's WTP 1 during the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n6.0 RMP Document Management System\n\nA management system has been established for the USAG's WTP 1 that attributes responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program and that meets the regulatory requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  The management system documents the positions of the personnel responsible for implementing the Risk Management Program elements, and defines the lines of authority through an organizational chart.  The Risk Management Program Team designated in the USAG's WTP 1 RMP was assembled from a group of individuals, each with highly specialized expertise in one or many areas.  \n\n\n\n7.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe USAG's accident prevention program for WTP 1, which includes the chlorine process, consists of the 13 elements summariz"

The results of the audit are documented; recommendations are resolved; and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The latest compliance audit was conducted in March 2014 and the two most recent compliance audit reports are maintained on file.\n\n\n\n7.10 Incident Investigation\n\nThe USAG and the installation support contractor operating the USAG's WTP 1 will jointly investigate all incidents that reasonably could have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, and/or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The USAG requires the installation support contractor to train its employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.  An investigation team will be assembled and the investigation will be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations will be resolved as quickly as possible, and appropriate process enhancements will be implemented.  Information found during the investigation will be reviewed by appropriate staff, used to added information and/or to revise O&M procedures, and passed on to the training unit for inclusion in the existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent a future event.  The Incident Investigation Report will be maintained on file for 5 years.\n\n\n\n7.11 Employee Participation Plan\n\nThe USAG requires the installation support contractor to follow the Employee Participation Plan to involve the contractor's employees in creating safety awareness and to enhance the safety of the chlorine process.  The employee participation includes a monthly schedule for each employee to review pre-identified safety information and procedures from the WTP 1 RMP.  Information related to the Risk Management Program is communicated during these reviews and employee feedback related to minimizing hazards and improving the safety of the process is taken into consideration.
