Our philosophy is to continually improve the safe working conditions of our employees to minimize accidents and reduce the potential for either an on-site or off-site release.  With this in mind, the department is incorporating many of the Risk Management Plan elements into other areas of the processes not covered under 40 CFR 68 to improve overall safety of the site.  This includes beginning an environmental management system to reduce any adverse environmental impact."

This program will help prevent the occurance of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in startup, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nOur program encourages and requires maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation in the standard.  We shall, as a minimum: a) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and b) provide our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe City of Waco Water Utilities Department believes that preventative maintenance and training are the keys to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating procedures have been reviewed and revised to enable employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.  \nThe department has taken steps to educate and inform the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews in the appropriate response to an accidental release.  The training includes classroom training and operating procedures on the proper response to emergency situations.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Old McGregor Road Ground Storage facility uses chlorine to boost the disinfection residual of treated water.  The chlorine cylinders are located inside a building, which will act as a passive mitigation in the event of a release.  There are chlorine sensors and entry alarms connected to the SCADA system.
