FBP is committed to conducting work in a manner that protects workers, the public, and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in safety throughout the plant and in the detailed programs and procedures, such as Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the X-611E Chlorination System, Worker Safety and Health Program, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Chemical Safety Mechanical Integrity Program, PORTS Emergency Plan, and Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS).  These programs and procedures systematically integrate safety, health, environmental protection and quality assurance into all levels of management and work planning, and work execution.\n\n\n\n2.0 Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPORTS is a 3,777-acre federal reservation that began uranium enrichment operations using the gaseous diffusion process in 1954.  In 1993, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) leased the uranium enrichment production and operations facilities at PORTS to the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC).  USEC enriched uranium at PORTS for use in commercial nuclear power reactors until May 2001. DOE contracted with USEC to operate and maintain the returned gaseous diffusion process buildings and feed complexes until March 29, 2011 when FBP assumed responsibility.  USEC returned the \"Balance of Plant\" facilities on Septemebr 30, 2011 when FBP assumed responsibility on that date.  \n\n\n\nFBP performs Environmental Remediation, Waste Management, Facility Surveillance and Maintenance, and Decontamination & Decommissioning (D&D) activites, in acc"

This work scope includes operational and maintenance activities at the onsite X-611 Water Treatment Plant which is located to the north of the plant. Chlorine is the only substance listed in 40 CFR 68.130 which is present in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity; therefore PORTS is a level III reporting facility according to the EPA's Risk Management guidelines.  PORTS has a complete Process Safety Management program based on chlorine, which was last reviewed on October 28, 2013 as required by OSHA.  We used a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis to serve as our Process Hazard Analysis method.  \n\n\n\nRaw water is taken from well fields, treated and supplied to PORTS for numerous uses.  A portion of the water is filtered and post-disinfected, using chlorine, and used to supply sanitary water, fire system water, cooling water, and other uses.  Raw water treatment takes place at the X-611 Water Treatment Plant which is located to the north of the gaseous diffusion plant.  The sanitary water treatment process is similar to other water treatment plants throughout the United States that use chlorine to disinfect the water for sanitary purposes. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine, provided in 2000 pound [1-ton] containers, has a maximum administrative limit of three filled chlorine containers, or 6000 pounds at any one time.  This quantity is in excess of the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.  A typical working inventory is 4000 pounds or two 1-ton containers attached to the system manifold.  The third container, if present, would be in an unconnected storage position adjacent to the in-use cylinders.  All three container positions are inside a building with a vehicle door to accommodate deliveries.  Daily chlorine use at X-611 Water Treatment Plant is approximately 65 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine feed facility is equipped with container-mounted vacuum regulators which reduce the pressure of the"

FBP has implemented the required controls through an extreme set of programs and procedures.  These programs and procedures also apply for the management of structures, programs and components that pertain to Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered process and related activities. \n\n\n\n4.0 Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nPORTS five year history exhibits a chemical release performance of no significant or threshold quantity release of chlorine.  Minor releases can occur during routine operations and maintenance activities, but have not resulted in significant personnel exposure or environmental impacts.\n\n\n\n5.0 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nFBP has developed a written emergency plan to provide a comprehensive description of emergency preparedness and response to classified emergencies at PORTS.  FBP is the lead organization responsible for managing the overall direction and control of emergency responses at the Portsmouth site.  \n\n\n\nThis program has been established to manage and respond in a consistent and integrated way to accidents or other emergency situations that may occur at the site.  The structure of this program is intended to ensure that the consequences of emergencies are promptly mitigated and that the health and safety of the public, personnel on the surrounding DOE reservation, plant "

The Emergency Management organization is responsible for maintaining and updating the Emergency Plan as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe plan describes the emergency response structure and roles and responsibilities prior to, during and after an emergency.  The plan describes the actions during an emergency which include the following: Declaration of an emergency, Activation of the Emergency Operation Center (EOC), emergency response, reentry, and event termination.  Upon notification of an event, the field Emergency Response Organization (ERO) is activated for response to the scene and mitigation of the incident.  Emergencies are classified through a site-wide standardized system that uses Emergency Action Levels (EALs) as trigger points for equating an incident to a specific emergency classification.  Using specific criteria, the Plant Shift Superintendent (PSS) determines the level of response required and determines if the event meets the proper criteria to classify the event as an Alert or a Site Area Emergency (SAE).  Upon determination of event classification, the Incident Commander (IC) makes notifications to off-site agencies and activates the EOC Cadre.\n\n\n\nPrompt notification of on-site personnel, emergency responders, and off-site organizations and agencies is critical during an emergency event.  The PSS is responsible for notifying the ERO using the plant radio system, pagers, Public Address (PA) system and/or the plant telephone system.\n\n\n\nThe severity of some emergencies on-site may warrant the use of off-site individuals, organziations, and agencies.  As a result, agreements with off-site support agencies have been developed and are maintained by FBP.

Protective actions for on-site personnel include alerting, assembly/accountability, sheltering in place, evacuation, monitoring and decontamination.\n\n\n\nFBP maintains medical coverage consistent with the activities being conducted on-site.  In an emergency, off-duty medical personnel may be notified and directed to required locations, if needed.  FBP maintains and updates the PORTS Emergency Public Information (EPI) Plan.
