      "SummaryText": "Bayer Baytown Executive Summary\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention\n\nThe Bayer Baytown Industrial Park's primary responsibility is to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, facility, customers and surrounding communities.  While meeting our business objectives, our employees strive for safety, health, and environmental excellence in all aspects of Bayer's activities.\n\nWithout exception, every Bayer employee is responsible for working safely.  Safety is the top responsibility at all levels of management and supervision where they are expected to set an example with their own behavior.  The design, operation, maintenance, and regular inspections of Bayer facilities safeguard employees and the public.  Bayer works to make its operations safer by continually improving safety and health measures.\n\nResponsible Care is a public commitment to which the Bayer Baytown Industrial Park actively supports as a member of the American Chemical Council.  Responsible Care is focused on continuous improvement of health, safety and environmental performance.\n\nThe Bayer Baytown Industrial Park is a Super Star facility and a Star Among Stars in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Programs. \n\nDescription of the Facility\n\nLocated in West Chambers County on 1,700 acres along Cedar Bayou, Bayer's first operating units came on line in 1971 with steady growth continuing over the next 30+ years.  The site doubled its manufacturing capacity between 1997 and 2001 with Bayer's largest-ever capital expansion ($1.4 billion). Known today as a thriving industrial park, approximately 35% of the Bayer acreage are developed.  Bayer hosts four guest facilities (Borden Chemical, El Dorado Nitrogen, First Chemical Texas, and Texas Brine) to provide raw materials for the facility and one energy center (Calpine Corporation) to produce steam and electricity for the entire complex.\n\nThe site is serviced by barge, rail and truck and has pipeline service to and from industry along the Houston"

The management team at Bayer Baytown has designated the entire site as a Process Safety Management site.  All processes are covered at the full PSM level and are considered to be Program Level III processes under the scope of Risk Management.\n\nThere are seven chemicals that are used in quantities greater than the threshold quantities defined in the RMP regulations:\n* Ammonia\n* Ammonia solution (greater than 20%)\n* Butane\n* Chlorine\n* Formaldehyde solution (37%)\n* Phosgene\n* Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomer form).\nTwo other chemicals (anhydrous hydrogen chloride and hydrogen) are used at the Baytown site that are covered in the RMP regulation but exist in quantities significantly less than threshold quantities.\n\nManagement of Risk\n\nThe site is covered by Process Safety Management (PSM).  PSM elements are:\n\nEmployee Participation:\nEmployees participate on numerous safety steering committees that potentially affect the work life of each area at the Bayer Baytown site.  Action items that are identified from inspections, incidents, process hazards analyses, etc. are provided to employees for review.  Involvement of personnel in the OSHA-VPP program has been exceptional.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll site personnel have access to the company's electronic mail system and Intra"

The Bayer facility is an active participant in the Baytown Local Emergency Planning Committee (and Emergency Management Office).  All emergency plans have been coordinated with the Baytown LEPC.  The Bayer facility has also been involved with the Chambers County LEPC.  All RMP plans have been reviewed with both LEPC groups.  Community outreach efforts are currently underway in all communities in the vicinity of the Bayer facility.  Bayer's role in the community emergency action plan is documented in the community procedures.\n\nThe Bayer facility has also been an active participant in the Baytown Citizens Advisory Panel to address concerns of the citizens regarding their proximity to manufacturing sites.  The City of Baytown is notified of all plant level alarms as an information source to citizens.  Through the East Harris County Manufacturers Association, Bayer participates in recording messages on a CAER line for information and emergency notification purposes.  The Bayer facility posts updates for the community in the event of an emergency or significant activity at the Bayer facility.\n\nThe Baytown Plant Managers Network represents the manufacturing sector of the Baytown area.  Through this organization, a siren system was installed to alert the community.  The system is being expanded to include other out- lying areas."

The information resides in a controlled electronic system that is updated regularly.  All Process Safety Information (PSI) is verified at each scheduled process hazards analysis.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\nEvery five years, process hazards analyses (PHA's) are conducted in each process.  The HazOp method is used to conduct PHA's.  Findings are identified, prioritized and then promptly corrected.  The information is shared with personnel who are impacted by the findings.  The action items and completion schedules are available through the electronic system.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nOperating procedures that address normal and abnormal operating situations are in place.  Deviations from established operating limits and the consequences of these deviations are clearly identified and easily referenced.   The procedures are reviewed annually to assure accuracy.\n\nTraining:\nTraining on these operating procedures is ongoing to assure that operators know and understand the safe operation of their unit and that they understand the necessary actions for abnormal situations.  Employee training is documented and tracked through a network system.  The system allows specific training needs to be identified as well as tracks the completion of required modules. \n\nContractor Safety:\nControl of contractor activity in operating areas is well established.  A safety steering committee and safety council actively monitors the actions of contractors to assure their safety, the safety of the Bayer facility and its employees. Contract employees are required to participate annually in comprehensive industry safety training. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\nReviews are conducted of any new facility, major modification, or a change (management of change) before the new system can become operational.  Findings are addressed prior to startup."
