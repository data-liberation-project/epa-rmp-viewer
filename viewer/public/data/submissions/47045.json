In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of signi?cant releases of toxic substances as well as ?res, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels, which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. \n\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n* A knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group.\n* A well designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner.\n* Improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate.\n* Excellence in safety programs and practices: a superior safety and accident record.\n* Preparation and training for emergency"

This is a closed, contained system, in which the ammonia is recirculated to refrigerate the meat processing and storage areas in the plant.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the failure of the high temperature recirculating receiver containing ammonia resulting in a ten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could reach offsite endpoints before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a pressure relief valve on the control pressure receiver resulting in an ammonia release. Under common, weather conditions, ammonia could reach offsite endpoints before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: mechanical integrity program which requires replacement of these valves every five years; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility. \nIn the last 5 years there have been no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe Plant adheres to the requirements of the Process Safety Management and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspec"

The Prevention Programs consist of several elements and policies listed below:\n \n* Employee Participation\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Operator Training\n* Contractors\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Hot Work Permits\n* Management of Change\n* Incident Investigation\n* Emergency Planning and Response\n* Compliance Audit\n\nThis facility?s emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120). We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local ?re department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and the ?re department. The facility is equipped with an emergency siren.\nAmmonia is a colorless gas that has a pungent odor.  Potential health effects from ammonia occur through inhalation, skin contact, eye contact and ingestion.  In case of a release stay up wind.  If exposed to ammonia, remove from exposure, flush with large amounts of water and seek medical attention.\n \nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant, facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program/OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
