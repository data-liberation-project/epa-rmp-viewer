The Proctor WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The WTP is included in the Comanche County regional Emergency Response Plan.  WTP operators are trained to contact the Comanche County dispatch via 911 in the event of a release.  The Comanche County dispatch contacts the nearest first responder unit (typically the City of Comanche Fire Department) which coordinates the emergency response according to the County's Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.155(e))."

      "SummaryText": "The Upper Leon River Municipal Water District (MWD) operates the Proctor Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located at 2250 Highway 2861, Comanche County, Texas.  The Proctor WTP produces potable water for the cities of Comanche, De Leon, Dublin, Gorman, Hamilton and surrounding rural communities.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 17,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Proctor WTP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the Upper Leon River MWD developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Proctor WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the Proctor WTP General Manager is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the Upper Leon River MWD will periodically"
