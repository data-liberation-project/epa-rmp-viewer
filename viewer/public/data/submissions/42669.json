      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOCEAN STATE POWER\n\nThis executive summary includes a brief description of Ocean State Power\u00bfs (OSP) facility risk management program.  This information is being submitted in accordance with USEPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The following elements are described per the RMP* Submit 2004.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOcean State Power has developed and maintains an active emergency prevention and response program in accordance with applicable regulations.  This program consists of two primary elements:  Emergency prevention and Response Plan and an Emergency Response Procedures Handbook.  OSP is prepared to respond to emergencies quickly and effectively.  The primary goal is to protect the health and safety of plant personnel and the public, and to minimize damage to the environment and plant equipment in the unlikely event of an accident.  An Emergency Coordinator/Qualified Individual (EC/QI) is responsible for implementing and overseeing emergency response activities onsite.  If the primary EC is not available, there is an assistant, plus alternate individuals who have received adequate training and have been delegated authority.  The facility\u00bfs Procedures Handbook provides actions for proper notifications within OSP\u00bfs emergency response organization to activate necessary resources.  OSP has an ongoing employee health and safety training program conducted by qualified instructors.  Facility personnel are trained in functional areas that correspond to their emergency response duties and responsibilities.  Drills are conducted for site emergency managers on a periodic basis to exercise procedures and maintain readiness.  Integrated drills are conducted in conjunction with the Harrisville Fired Department to coordinate offsite emergency response procedures.\n\n2.\tDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOcean State Power is a 560"

      "SummaryText": "to the four ammonia flow control/evaporator units, and four ammonia injection systems (one per HRSG).  The unloading area includes an unloading pump rated for eighty gpm with vapor recovery, and concrete berm to collect an accidental spill from truck delivery.  There are several interlock functions within the ammonia supply line that could activate an emergency shutoff valve.  Isolation valves and a bypass valve are provided as a contingency, should the ammonia flow control valve have to be taken out of service.  Ammonia leak detection devices are also provided.\n\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOcean State Power complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State and Federal codes and regulations having emergency response requirements, including the following:\n\n\u00bf\t29 CFR Part 1910.120\n\u00bf\t29 CFR Part 1910.38(a)\n\u00bf\t40 CFR Part 112\n\u00bf\t40 CFR Part 355\n\u00bf\t40 CFR Part 265 subparts C,D\n\u00bf\t49 CFR Part 194\n\u00bf\tRhode Island Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management\n\u00bf\tRhode Island Rules and Regulations for the Investigation & Remediation of Hazardous Materials Releases\n\u00bf\tRhode Island Oil Pollution Control Regulations\n\nOcean State Power operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week and consists of approximately 30 employees which includes an Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Manager, O&M Supervisor, Maintenance Supervisor, HS&E Coordinator and operating and maintenance crews.   \n\n4.\tFive Year Accident History\n\nNot applicable\n\n5.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nOcean State Power is required to prepare and submit a RMP that meets Program 1 requirements which requires a facility to coordinate with local emergency responders.  OSP has completed this requirement under OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management standard.  This program is reviewed annually and revised according to facility changes or regulatory changes.\n\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOcean State Power has an Emergency Prevention and Response Plan which includes periodic training"

      "SummaryText": "megawatt (MW) combined cycle gas turbine electric generating facility that operates on a continuous basis.  The area surrounding the plant is gated and public access is restricted.  Natural gas, the primary fuel, is delivered by Algonquin pipelines to metering stations located at the northeast property boundary.  Previously OSP had stored No. 2 fuel oil for emergency backup fuel but as of 2003, we no longer store No 2 oil in our two 1,000,000-gallon aboveground tanks.  OSP consists of two identical phases which each including two GE frame 7 combustion turbine generators, two recovery steam generator/boilers with supplemental firing using duct burners, and one steam turbine generator.  Auxiliary equipment includes an electrical switchyard, wet mechanical cooling towers, and a zero discharge water treatment system.  OSP also includes selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems; two 150 foot concrete stacks equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems; two emergency diesel generators; and chemical storage.  OSP is operated from a control room where operators have access to facility operating date from a computerized distributed control system (DCS) and a central data acquisition and handling system (DAHS).\n\nAqueous ammonia (29% concentration in water) is the only regulated substance used in a process that is above the threshold quantity identified in 40CFR Part 68.130.  Ammonia is used in the combustion turbines as a reducing agent for the SCR NOx emissions control system.  Aqueous ammonia is evaporated in hot air and injected into the flue gases upstream of a catalyst located in the heat recovery boilers to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.  The amount of ammonia injected and the NOx/NH3 emissions in the exhaust stack gases are continuously measured and recorded.  The SCR system is comprised of subsystems \u00bf aqueous ammonia unloading area, a storage tank to provide four weeks capacity, two ammonia transfer pumps (one back up) to transfer solution"
