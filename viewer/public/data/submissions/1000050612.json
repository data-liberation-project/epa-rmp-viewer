The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant is located approximately four miles east of Midkiff, Texas on Farm to Market Road 2401 (about thirty miles southeast of Midland, Texas) and operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\r\n\r\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as natural gas liquids)\r\n2. Condensate\r\n3. Residue Gas\r\n\r\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels at the plant were e"

The scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 883,804 pounds (210,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in one of the two Gasoline Storage Spheres (V-G452 or V-G454). The entire inventory of one vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.8 mile radius. \r\n\r\nWhile the plant is located in a rural area, the WCS could affect an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptor (equipment storage yard and portable office buildings located northwest of the plant).  Atlas has numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system that can divert all incoming gas to an emergency flare. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Midkiff Gas Plant is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 100,440 pounds of the flammable mixture from the natural gas liquids Consolidator Product Surge Tank (V-404) at the Midkiff Gas Plant. The release would occur from valve failure leaving a 10 inch diameter opening from the pressurized tank. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.4 miles, which includes an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptor. The release is expected to be isolated by plant personnel within 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to aid in accident release prevention.\r\n\r\nA. Employee Participation\r\n\r\nTarga Pipeline encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

These technical documents address the following:\r\n\r\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\r\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\r\n3. Maximum intended inventories\r\n4. Upper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\r\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\r\n6. Identification of all necessary regulatory equipment design documents\r\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\r\n\r\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM Program.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  For specific areas within the process, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The plant maintains the overall process within these limits by using controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed facility changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \r\n\r\nC.

There has been one accidental release from a covered process that resulted significant property damage on site. On January 12, 2015 a release of inlet gas caught fire that destroyed one engine and a compressor. Repairs from the fire cost Targa Pipeline approximately one million dollars. There were no injuries, deaths, or off-site impacts as a result of the fire. Targa Pipeline has since revised training and operating procedures as well as upgraded equipment at the site to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Midkiff Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa Pipeline staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.

Rather, the company believes that diligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework that allows for the continued improvement to the level of safety at the Midkiff Gas Plant. Some of the key components of the program that will help maintain and, where applicable, improve safety are:\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n\r\nThe PHA provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards. \r\n\r\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous release thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n\r\nInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that we maintain and increase our level of safety protection."
