It is a regulated substance by EPA requiring us to comply with the risk management program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.\n\nThis facility manintains 1000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. See RMP Comp for our combined capacity in nurse tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a stationary storage tank on site.See RMP Comp for  the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage and the total capacity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored on this site.\n\n     The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and ASME codes.  The faciilty complies with the NSI K61.1 standards EPA's accidental release prevention rule, IA Fertilizer Law Part 21 Chapter 43 Rule 43.6(200) as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut offs and emergency shut off valves.
