The same properties that make this chemical so valuable in water treatment also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling it.  Safe handling procedures prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our own personal health and our co-workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n    The Berwick/Bayou Vista Water Treatment Plant is a small facility, which provides potable water for the Berwick/Bayou Vista area.  It is located at 400 Pattie Dr. in Berwick.  The primary purpose of this facility is to produce potable water for the surrounding communities.  The raw water is pumped into the facility from the nearby Bayou Tech.  The water then goes through several processes to remove the particles and contaminants that are in the water.  Chlorine is added to the water in the final step of the process.  Chlorine is used to kill pathogens that may remain after the process is complete.  The water is then pumped into distribution where the community uses it.\n    The maximum amount of chemical that this facility keeps is two- (2) - 1 ton containers of chlorine.  Chlorine is a regulated substance.\n    The worst case release scenario of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is the total failure of one of the 1 ton cylinders resulting in an immediate release of 2000 pounds of chlorine. Due to the fact that the cylinders are constructed, tested and inspected under strict guidelines and routinely replaced by the chemical supplier, it is very unlikely that this wil"

The model used to arrive at this distance was the EPA's RMP Comp program.\n    The alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16\" diameter valve body opening.  It consists of a total release of 2000 pounds of chlorine over a 60-minute duration.  The distance to the endpoint of the lower toxicity limit for the alternative release scenario is 0.48 miles.  The model used to arrive at this distance was the ALOHA modeling system.\n    This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  All employees undergo training in the emergency procedures associated with chlorine.  This facility had no reportable release of chlorine in the past five years.  This facility's emergency response plan is coordinated with the St. Mary Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). In the case of an emergency the facility's employees are trained to contact the local fire department who will coordinate any necessary actions that need to take place."
