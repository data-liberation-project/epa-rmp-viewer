Members of the Reliability Group are consulted whenever buying new machinery or when a machine design change is being considered.        \n \nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has safe work practices in place that help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include but are not limited to: 1) the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous work areas, 2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance, 4) a permit procedure to control activities that maybe a source of ignition (i.e., hot work), and 5) the controlled entry of personnel into plant areas.  The Refinery safe work practices along with training of personnel who may be involved with these types of work form a system that aides in making sure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) is one element of the Refinery's PSM system. The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  MOC applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures, or technology.  \n\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, electrical classification, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an authorization to implement and start up"

Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Refinery\u00c2\u00bfs PSM program is audited periodically to ensure procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years with an audit team composed of various subject matter experts from within the company who are not employed by the Hawaii Refinery. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on file in the PSM Coordinator's office.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRefinery processes have hazards associated with them that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The PSM program that has been discussed in this document applies to all RMP processes at the Refinery.  The program activities as a whole reduce the likelihood of accident scenarios that could be due to equipment failure and/or human error.\n\nThe Refinery also has safety features within the process units designed to quickly detect, contain and control, and reduce the consequences of the release.

These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating what if situations that stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations.  Hypothetical drills include plant drills and formal drills.  During a plant drill, operating situations that may be a potential fire problem are presented and the group goes through the motions of extinguishing the fire.  Other Refinery personnel may be asked to participate depending on the degree of the drill and apparatus required.  Formal drills on a larger scale are scheduled periodically.  These drills can include outside agencies, and participants treat this hypothetical drill situation as if it is a real fire and respond accordingly.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chevron Refinery is coordinated with the Oahu Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which has members from the local emergency response community, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Campbell Industrial Park (CIP), where the Refinery is located, has collective emergency management available by way of the CIP CLEAN Emergency Resources Guide.  This guide compliments Refinery resources and is used as a focal point for coordinating emergency response and management for CIP.  The CIP CLEAN Emergency Resources Guide, along with the Refinery plan, is used as a reference during drills for notifications to the appropriate agencies and neighboring businesses.

LPS highlights types of risks present in everyday jobs by utilizing behavioral observation.  Once these risks are highlighted, solutions are developed and addressed. LPS also provides a Loss Prevention Self Assessment tool designed to help our employees assess, analyze, and act to mitigate risks associated with the various work tasks performed throughout the work day.

      "SummaryText": "oducts (for example, gasoline, Jet, propane, etc.) is known as refining.  Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation methods.  Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances.  Those regulated flammable substances on location at the Chevron Hawaii Refinery include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, propadiene, butane, butene, 1,3-butadiene, 2-methylpropylene, Isobutane, and pentane. These substances are generally handled as part of a flammable mixture.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Hawaii Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Process (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in PSM through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses.  The importance of Refinery safety is mentioned as part of every organizational meeting.  Safety topic presentations are frequently included as part of meeting agendas and responsibility for these presentations is often rotated among employees to give everyone a chance to participate.  Operations safety meetings are held on a frequent basis and"

A HAZOP is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.   A final list of action items is reviewed with the appropriate management representatives and after concurrence, is distributed for follow-up and communicated to all affected employees. A copy of the final report is maintained in the refinery main library and is available to all employees. This action item list is tracked to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the Refinery HAZOP Database.  PHA\u00c2\u00bfs are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes (design, regulatory, etc.) that have taken place in the process since the last HAZOP and includes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as with the initial HAZOP. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Refinery maintains written operating procedures addressing each Plant's operational processes including start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, planned shutdown, and the initial start-up of a new plant or after a planned maintenance shutdown.  These procedures are available to operations personnel and serve as a basis for training new operations personnel.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Refinery also has an active and comprehensive training program for all operations personnel that serves to build on the operating procedures mentioned above.

Once in the Refinery, new operations personnel piggy-back with more experienced operators before taking on full responsibility for his or her duties.  After a new operator demonstrates the skills necessary to operate on his or her own, they can work independently. The operator is then fully qualified upon completion of the Formal Operating Training Program. In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures at least every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  All training is documented and kept on record in the Refinery's Training and Development Department.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chevron Hawaii Refinery uses contract personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily to perform maintenance work, including during shutdowns and construction projects.  Contractors are selected based on their work performance and their safety systems, including their safety incident rates, the quality of their safety programs, policies, and processes, and their training programs.  Our high risk contractors also subscribe to a third party review and must achieve good standings in order to continue working in our refinery.  Overall, they are selected based on their projected capability to perform within our expectations and comply with all applicable safety and environmental regulations.\n\nPrior to working in the refinery, all contractors attend a refinery orientation.  If their work is limited to office buildings, they view a video with key safety, environmental, emergency, and security procedures and policies.  If their work is in the field, their orientation consists of a face to face session that covers the same topics, but is geared towards work in the field.  All safe work practices and process hazards are also covered in this face to face orientation.  \n\nThe refinery also complies with the Corporate Contractor Health Environment and Safety Program.

Requirements for each contractor are tracked by their sponsor.  \n\nThe Chevron Refinery has initiated a Contractor Safety Council to help review and improve the safety performance of contractors and of Chevron work processes.  Representatives from all contract companies are encouraged to participate.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe PSM regulation mandates that a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\nThe purpose of the PSSR is to insure that prior to startup, refinery equipment is reviewed to determine whether it is safe to operate, and meets all applicable requirements of Company standards, good engineering practices, industry codes and practices, and local, State, and Federal codes and statutes.  The PSSR consists of several independent reviews, including a Plant Protection Review, a Safety in Designs Review, a Plant Readiness Review, and confirmation that training of all employees involved in the equipment operation or maintenance has been completed.   \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.  The Refinery has several written programs in place that detail well-established practices and procedures for the inspection, testing, monitoring, and maintenance of process equipment, tankage and utilities, and instrumentation and safety systems.  Training is routinely conducted on these practices and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.

Refinery management and supervisory personnel fully participate in and support this process.   \nIncident Investigation\n\nThe intent of the Chevron Refinery Loss and Near Loss Investigation Process is to learn from an incident or near loss, prevent a recurrence, and help prevent similar incidents.  An incident investigation addresses the following: 1) the nature of the incident, 2) the factors that contributed to the incident and 3) solutions identified as a result of the investigation.  The investigation determines the root cause of the incident and may include interviewing involved personnel, as well as reviewing process and equipment data, applicable procedures, operating conditions and training records.  \n\nThe TapRooT Incident Investigation or 5 Why Investigation techniques are used as the guide for all incident investigations.  Incidents with the potential to impact personnel or the environment are investigated.\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nProcess Safety Information is one of several elements of the Refinery's PSM system.  Each Refinery plant or process area has an Electronic Operating Manual that contains a compilation of safety and design related information.  Its purpose is to train and inform employees and contractors of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the units. All process safety information is available to all employees. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each PSM covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is known as the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis.
