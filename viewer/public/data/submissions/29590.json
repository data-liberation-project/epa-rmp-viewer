Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Dow Chemical Michigan Operations are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with City of Midland Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activites encompass chemical manufacturing, including agricultural and specialty chemicals and plastics.  We have 33 regulated substances and 19 covered processes present at our facility.

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including\n     administrative controls and migitaion measures.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Anaylsis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and PHAST v5.11 computer aided modeling program.  For alternative release scenario anaylses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well at PHAST v5.11 and v6.00 computer aided modeling program.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDow Chemical Michigan Operations maintains detailed records of safety information that among other things describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information.  Some of these would include, Material Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  For initial screening and risk evaluation the Dow Chemical Fire and Explosion Index, The Dow Chemical, Chemical Exposure Index and a Reactive Chemical and Process Hazard Analysis are conducted.  These listed methodologies are supplemented when needed with analyses thaty may include some of the following:  What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis.  A team of qualified personnel undertakes the studies with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activites within our covered processes, Dow Chemical Mighigan Operations maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is "
