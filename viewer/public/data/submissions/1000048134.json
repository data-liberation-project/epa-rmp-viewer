Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility exceeds the threshold quonatity set by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shut downs, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel suppliment the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based on OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of local fire authorities and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in  accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture industrial gases, hydrogen is one of these gases.   Hydrogen is used by our customer in their manufacturing process.  \n\n\n\nHydrogen is the only regulated substance located at this facility in an amount exceeding the threshold quantities.  The PRISM Hydrogen Generator incorporates a steam methane reformer-based fuel processor and a pressure swing adsorption hydrogen purification unit to convert natural gas and steam to pure hydrogen. The hydrogen generator is fully automated and designed for remote, unattende"

The regulated process at this facility is the PRISM hydrogen generator(reformer) and backup tank and associated system.  The site also occasionally stores up to 3 trailers of liquid hydrogen on site as part of a drop and swap program. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regualtion.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nThis facility came on line in September of 1967.  In the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or the accidental release of, flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacutations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facilities emergency response program is based on OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and to initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  The have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in case of emergency.  Emergency response activites have been coordinated with the Middletown Fire Department for fires relating to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectivness of our emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1966.  The facility resolves recommendations from PHA's and Incident Investigations, in a timely manner, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.
