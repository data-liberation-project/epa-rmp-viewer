We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces para-aminophenol and acetaminophen using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Acetaminophen is a pain-relief medication for use by the pharmaceutical industry.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a neutralizer for an acidic phase in one of our process steps for manufacturing para-aminophenol.

The process is very similar to the hydrogenation processing step used to make salad dressing or mayonnaise by food manufacturers.  [Subject to Program Level 1.]\n \nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that could potentially be posed to our employees, the public, and the environment if one of these were mishandled or otherwise involved in an accident.\n\nKEY OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario is considered to be a catastrophic failure of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks with its maximum allowable inventory (146,880 pounds).  In accordance with EPA regulations, it is assumed that the entire contents release within 10 minutes and all of the liquid ammonia will vaporize immediately.  The resultant plume from this event must be assumed to disperse downwind under meteorological conditions which will result in the greatest distance to the 14 mg/l toxic endpoint.  The estimated distance to this toxic endpoint using these assumptions is 5.4 miles from the tank.  The off-site impact would affect downwind receptors.\n\nThe worst-case plume is a pie-wedge shape about 200 feet wide that would move in the direction of the wind.  We include all potential receptors within the circle of 5.4 mile-radius around the plant:\n\nApproximately 58,000 persons in private residences\nVarious churches/places of worship\nVarious public/private schools \nVa"

A water deluge system around the ammonia tanks will be available, in addition to the sites existing fire water system, to mitigate such an incident.  Specific operating procedures, extensive training, plus a program of periodic inspection and preventive maintenance helps minimize the likelihood of this event.  In addition, the anhydrous ammonia tanks will be equipped with ammonia leak sensors, high liquid level alarms, and high pressure alarms for early detection of a problem with the tank system.  Also, ammonia leak sensors and water deluge systems are being installed at the ammonia unloading station and at the ammonia vaporizers.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe alternative scenario is the rupture of a 2-inch liquid ammonia transfer line releasing 78 pounds of ammonia.  The quantity would be limited to this amount because of the presence of excess flow valves located throughout the liquid lines.  The analysis of the dispersion of the resultant vapor cloud was conducted using typical meteorological conditions for the Raleigh area.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.18 mile and there would be no off-site impact.\n\nThe ammonia sensors and remotely actuated water deluge systems which are being installed around the storage tanks, the truck unloading station, and the ammonia vaporizer shed will reduce the likelihood and duration of this potential event and reduces the potential impact of any ammonia release from the process.

The estimated distance to the 1 psig exposure end point is 0.2 mile from the tank.  There is no off-site impact from this release scenario.  A program of periodic tank inspection and maintenance will minimize the likelihood of this event.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nThis site is operated using a team approach designed to enhance communication and interaction between individuals and functional groups at the site and to improve performance in all aspects of our business.

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with Wake County's local emergency response plan.  Mallinckrodt is a founding member of the Wake County Local Emergency Planning Committee and continues to be very actively involved.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAs a result of previous process hazard analysis reviews, the site developed an ammonia safety improvement project.  During May 1999, the site began installing these improvements which will provide new controls, prevention systems, and active mitigation systems to minimize the potential for employee and public exposure resulting from accidental releases from the anhydrous ammonia process.  The revised Process Hazard Analysis for these improvements and the off-site consequence analysis were both completed prior to the submission of the RM Plan to the EPA (June 17, 1999).  Only the installation of the additional excess flow valves had an effect on the off-site consequence analyses presented in this plan, and these new valves were installed prior to submitting the RM Plan to the EPA.\n\nThe other safety improvements from this project were not in place at the time of submission of this plan, but are expected to be completed by the end of Summer, 1999.  These improvements include:\n\n7    a containment berm around the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks,\n7    ammonia detection sensors throughout the anhydrous ammonia system,\n7    high pressure and high liquid level alarms on the liquid ammonia storage tanks,\n7    remotely-activated emergency isolation valves in the liquid ammonia lines, and\n7    a remotely-activated water deluge system to mitigate ammonia vapors during an accidental release at the liquid ammonia storage tanks, the ammonia unloading station, and the ammonia vaporizers.\n\nIn addition, the following is a list of actions that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n7"
