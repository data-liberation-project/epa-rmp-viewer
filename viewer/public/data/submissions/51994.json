We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers including anhydrous ammonia.  We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Rensselaer Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the  County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and, has instructed employees on procedures for notification of the local fire authority (Rensselaer Fire Department) and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.

This facility also processes anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid to produce fluid fertilizer.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, and authorized contractors.\n\nUp to 60 times per year 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck or rail car and is stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank.  The manufacturing process is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and Program 3 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-case Scenario: Release of the total contents of the largest tank (or the largest tank attached to a railcar) would be released as a gas over 10 minutes.

The major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, over pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake and tornado.  Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, Emergency shutoff valves, alarms and procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release.  \n\nMitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would knock down the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia.  In addition, passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 85% capacity (through tank gauges and onsite personnel) are utilized.\n\nEmployees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis.  Employee Training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs.
