Additionally, the local Emergency Response Action Plan was updated to reflect the addition of butane.\n\n\n\nThis Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane blending system resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Rockford Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Win Bur Sew Fire Protection District and request their assistance.  The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Win Bur Sew Fire Protection District and Winnebago County Emergency Services Disaster Agency.  The fire department is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\n\n\n\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety.  Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles and is developing \"global\" operating procedures.\n\n\n\n"
