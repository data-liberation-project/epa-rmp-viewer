Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Indianapolis facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n-    Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parameters of the associated equipment and systems.\n\n-    Procedures and programs to develop"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nThe acetylene production area is equipped with a deluge system which can be operated manually or passively. The facility also employs plant emergency trip stations so that in the event of an emergency all plant processes will be halted.\n\n\n\nThe propylene system is equipped with an emergency shutoff switch which when  activated closes the tanks main isolation valves.  The propylene production area also incorporates the use of the plant emergency trip station.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Indianapolis facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency action program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment.
