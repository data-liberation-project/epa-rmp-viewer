All management ensures that the employees are working in a safe environment and that training of PPE and work processes are provided on a regular basis.  Employees are routinely instructed through classroom, hands-on, and on-the-job hazards associated with chemicals on their site and how to provent any potential injury or environmental impact.\n     This is an activated sludge, secondary treatment wastewater treatment facility within desig capacity of 8.1mgd.  The process includes mechanical bar screens, aerated grit chamber, flowmeters, primary settling tanks, aeration, secondary settling tanks, logoon, and chemical treatment that includes use of chlorine, ferric chloride, sodium bisulfite, and sulfur dioxide.  The sludge is processed through a belt press and hauled off site for disposal.  \n     The worst-case and alternative release scenarios were determined through use of the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables and Equations.  In the worst case, we took in consideration of a full tank rupturing on site with total discharge within 100 minutes.  Due to the location of the facility, there are potential off-site mitigation concerns that could impact residential areas as well as environmental concerns.  The sodium hypochlorite tanks are enclosed in a room that would potentially assist in reducing the immediate impact.  The chlorine systems are checked daily, and any concerns are immediately addressed.  With the enclosure, the tanks are away from potential damage to structural integrity of the tank and the daily checks make the worst-case scenario unlikely to occur.  The alternative case scenario was selected due to the likelyhood of malfunction of the tank refill system.  This release would be minimal and enclosed within the building.  Operations staff would quickly observe this cond"

The training provided to employees and posting of changing procedures readiliy accessable to employees also enhances preventive steps for safety.  This has resulted in not having any accident history with chlorine.  Employees are trained in containing any type of chemical leak, but are informed that the emergency services are to be contacted immediately.  The emergency response personnel will be able to control the situation as well as the potential mitigation concerns.\n     The employees are periodically retrained in the usage of PPE and emergency repair kits that could assist in containment and control.  Safety is a top priority to all personnel and we continually develop/upgrade programs due to technology changes and employee safety needs."
