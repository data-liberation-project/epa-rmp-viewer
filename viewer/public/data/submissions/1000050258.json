Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) facilities chlorine handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant facilities complex consists of four different chlorination stations and one chemical depot: (1) the LAAFP facility; (2)  the Los Angeles Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station (LAROCS); (3) the Van Norman Chemical Depot (VNCD); (4) the Van Norman Chloramination Station # 1 (VNCS#1); and (5) the Van Norman Chloramination Station #2 (VNCS#2). The LADWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the above five chlorination stations in June 2014. Subsequent to the submission of the RMP in June 2014, the LADWP proposed to make significant process changes at the LA Reservoir Outlet Chlorination Station. The proposed changes include the installation of new chlorinators and a dry media chlorine main "

It may be noted that currently any chlorine release from the bulk tank PSV is vented outside the chlorine storage room.\n\n\n\nThe LADWP proposed modifications in two parts [temporary modification and full upgrade (upgrade)] to facilitate the continued chlorination system operation during the replacement of chlorinators and the installation of the chlorine main dry scrubber. The temporary modification to the LAROCS has been completed and the facility is now in operation. The temporarily modified LAROCS has stopped withdrawing liquid chlorine from the bulk chlorine storage tank as well as from the ton containers and uses only gaseous chlorine for chlorination. The LADWP prepared Program Level 3 RMP in June 2014 because the LAAFP processes are subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. This 2015 RMP is an update of the June 2014 RMP and includes updated information for the LAROCS process. The June 2015 RMP also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.

The chlorine is activated by chlorine detectors at a concentration of 3 ppm.\n\n\n\nAll the five LAAFP processes currently store and/or use chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and the CalARP Program rules.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the LAAFP processes at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations. It also exceeds the specified threshold quantity of the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard. Thus, the LAAFP processes are subject to the federal and the California OSHA PSM regulations. Additional details of the five processes are provided below.\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant\n\nLiquid chlorine is supplied to the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant in 90-ton railcars with a backup of one-ton containers for the chlorination process.  Liquid or gaseous chlorine is withdrawn from the railcars. Midland valve actuators are connected to both the liquid and gas connections on the railcars.  The Midland valve actuators will close on the railcar and stop the flow of chlorine when 10 ppm of chlorine is detected in the area.  The Midland valve actuators can also be manually triggered from the following three locations: (1) Rail Car Platform (2) Chlorinator room, and (3) Control Room. In addition to the Midland actuators, there are three Jamesbury actuators on the hard piping to the flex hoses. The detection of 10 ppm of chlorine will automatically close the ball valves connecting the hard piping to the flex hoses, stopping the possible backflow of chlorine, in case a crack developed in the flex hose. \n\n\n\nLiquid chlorine travels under pressure to evaporator units, while gaseous chlorine can be withdrawn directly to the chlorinators.  The evaporators vaporize the liquid in a water bath to form a superheated gas which passes through a pressure reduc"
