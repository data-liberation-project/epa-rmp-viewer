      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nGarelick Farms of Franklin uses anhydrous ammonia, an EHS, at its plant in Franklin, Massachusetts. During the last five years there have been no releases.\n\nThis is due impart to there accidental release prevention program and other safety measures that are all part of their ongoing everyday operations. Accidents are prevented by our being pro-active to safety regulations and practices. It is Garelick's policy to constantly re-examine our operations and improve emergency response and accident prevention programs. \n\nWe prevent accidents by designing for safety. By having alarms and interlocks that provide multiple lines of safety; automatic shutdown devices for major equipment to reduce duration and quantity of an accidental release; fire protection; independent and redundant backup systems for critical safety processes to ensure reliability of safety systems; piping built and maintained per high-integrity piping design codes; quality assurance of critical equipment to ensure fabrication to design specifications. \n\nMaintenance of our plant is done 24 hours a day. Specially qualified personnel routinely inspect, test, and maintain all equipment, including valves, pumps, seals, and tanks to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity. In addition to regular maintenance operations, preventative maintenance (PM) is in place with all of our critical equipment with designated schedules. \n\nWe operate safely by our staff being trained in startup, shutdown, operation and maintenance of all equipment. Some maintenance activities require internal permitting to ensure work is done safely for protection of our employees, property, environment, and community. \n\nOur inventories are managed to minimize risk and to maintain minimum quantities consistent with manufacturing needs. Audits and inspections are done routinely. Appropriate regulatory permits are obtained and maintained. There are complete investigations of all accidents and incidents. \n\nGarelick Farm"

      "SummaryText": "s release scenarios: \n\nWorst Case Scenario - The largest vessel failed in a catastrophic manner. A quantity of 10,400 lbs. released over a period of 10 minutes. (Release rate of 1040 lbs./min.) The distance to endpoint was 1.8 miles. The height of the release is 0 feet. We have a stable atmospheric condition (F) and an average wind speed of 1.5 meters per second. There are several public receptors within the distance to endpoint. The estimated population within that area is 4500 people. There are no environmental receptors in the area. \n\nAlternative Case Scenario - There is a tank seam failure resulting in a one inch hole. This creates a release rate of .2437 lbs./min. The distance to endpoint is 0.8 miles. The height of the release is 0 feet. We have a stable atmospheric condition (F) and an average wind speed of 1.5 meters per second. There are several public receptors within the distance to endpoint. The estimated population within that area is 2500 people. There are no environmental receptors in the area. \n\nAdministrative controls and standard operating procedures are used as passive mitigation programs. The Emergency Response Team is trained in emergency shutdown procedures, hazardous material response and rescue operations. Environmental personnel are to be alerted, we coordinate with the Franklin Fire Department, Police Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee. \n\nOn going training of the Emergency Response Team is a high priority in maintaining the good safety record that we have. \n\nIn addition to all the ammonia detector sensors and the alarm on the CPU, we are presently installing a visual alarm to show in the Maintenance Department. \n\nGarelick is committed to compliance with regulatory requirements and close cooperation with local, state and federal agencies to prevent incidents and effectively respond if emergencies occur."
