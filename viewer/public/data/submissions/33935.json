              "Description": "Prevention:     The plant was awarded Best Operated Wastewater Treatment Facility in the South-East District by the State of Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) in 1983.  Numerous precautions are taken at the ECRWWTF to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas into the atmosphere, and to minimize the consequences if a release does occur.  As mentioned earlier, the plant is located in a sparsely populated area with prevailing southeastern winds which will dissipate the gas over the plant site and sparsely populated surrounding areas.\n\nChlorine Containers -- The chlorine is stored and discharged from one ton containers.  The containers are welded tanks with heads convexed inward and forge welded to the barrel.  The sides are crimped inward at each end to form chimes which provide a substantial grip for lifting beams.  The container valves are protected by removable steel valve protective housing.  All ton containers are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices.  The fusible metal is designed to yield or melt between 158F and 165F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture or the container in case of a fire or other exposure to high temperature.\n\nChlorine System -- The system has process controls, and a monitoring and detection system.  When in use the process between the evaporator and the basin is under a vacuum, therefore, any leaks causing a change in vacuum shuts down the chlorinator.  In addition, all underground chlorine piping is within secondary containment.  Process controls in place between the one ton containers, flexible connector, header valve, evaporator, and chlorinator is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to check for leaks prior to placing the containers on line, routine replacement of any gasket or valves, and chlorine leak detection device.\n\nActive Mitigation -- The chlorine system is an alarmed system.  If there is a release of chlorine an audible sounds, an indicator light illuminates, and the computer system indicates the release in the main office building.  Budgeted for fiscal year 2003 - 2004 is the installation of a chlorine scrubber system. \n\nPassive Mitigation -- Currently there is no passive mitigation at the ECRWWTF. Budgeted for fiscal year 2003 - 2004 is the enclosure of the chlorine storage area.\n\nMaintenance -- The alarm system is tested every two (2) weeks.  Chlorine repair kits are kept on-site for emergency operations.  An annual safety inspectionis performed at the ECRWWTF by David C. Holler, Environmental, Health and Safety Officer, City of West Palm Beach.  \n\nPersonnel -- The personnel involved in this process are licensed operators.  One operator per shift attends an annual Trouble Shooting of Chlorine - Safety and Response course.  Additionally, one operator attends an eigth (8) week Hazmat/First Responder course at the South Tech Fire Academy.  The Hazmat/First Responder course is refreshed annually with a one day course.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program -- A test is run once per month on the chlorination system.  Approximately four (4) to six (6) one ton containers are in the chlorine building at any given time.\n\nEmergency Response Plan / Procedures -- The wastewater treatment plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  The basis of the plan is if a chlorine leak occurs the utility personnel can take a defensive measure to seal the leak.  Defensive measures are defined as closing valves, such as cylinder valves and header valves.  In the event that a leak can not be stopped by simply closing a valve or valves, the utiltiy personnel shall evacuate the area of the cylinder leak to a safe diostance to await Fire Rescue personnel.  Utility personnel will notify the West Palm Beach Fire Departement by a designated red telephone or by calling 911.  The fire Rescue personnel then take charge of the situation with assistance from utility personnel.  If additional assitance is needed, the West Palm Beach Fire Departement will call upon the Palm Beach County Fire Rescue personnel. \n\nHazmat Response / Procedures -- The West Palm Beach Fire Department has established a two tiered approach to incidents involving hazardous materials.  First, all emergency response personnel will be trained as operational first responders.  The second level of response will be a Hazardous Materials Response Team specially trained and equipped to conduct offensive operations at a hazardous materials incident.  Prior to assignement to the West Palm Beach Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team, an individual must conform to the following criteria:\n\n(1)  Have successfully completed the hazardous Materials Technician course and have demonstrated the competencies outlined in the 1992 edition of the Natiional Fire Protection's Standard 472. \n\n(2)  Have completed a baseline medical examination pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.120 and have been determined by the ezamining physician to be free of any medical conditions which would place the employee at increased risk of impairment of the employee's health from work in hazardous materials emergency response. \n\n(3)  Hold a current certification as a State of Florida Medicla Technician, and/or Paramedic. \n\n(4) Demonstrate a working knowledge of Special Operations 5's layout, equipment locations and functions. \n\n(5)  Have a working knowledge of the West Palm Beach Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Team's Standard Operating Procedures.  \n\nHazardous materials incidents are categorized into four (4) levels based on the intensity and quantity of the release:  Level I -- A Level I incident is a minor situation.  A Level I incident is defined as a release of less than 25 gallons liquid or 50 pounds solid of a know hazardous material.  Level II --  A Level II incident is one in which a more serious threat is posed by the release or potential relaes of a hazardous material.  Level II incidents require a definte assitance and intervention by a Hazardous Materials Team.  Level III -- A Level III incident is a major incident requiring specialized assistance and may require assitance from support agencies.  A formal command post, staging area, and medicla and/or rehab groups are established.  The establishment and control over isolatins (hot) zones is included.  Level IV -- A Level IV incident is a local disaster.  This type of incident will severly strain or exceed the capabilities of local response agencies.  A long-term command post may be required.  It may require activation of an Emergency Operatins Center.  \n\nThe following procedures will be followed during an incident:  The Fire Rescue Unit arriving at a hazardous materials incident shall establish command, utilizing a unit or geographic location to indentify command.  The HazMat Group shall report directly to the Incident Commander.  The HazMat Group is responsible for recommending evacuation distances, obtaining information concerning the hazards and risks posed by the material(s) in question, recommending decontamination and safety measures, recommending possible mitigation efforts and provide other technical assitance.  The Incident Commander retains overall control and authority during the entire operation, and the HazMat Group shall perform mitigative actions. \n\nIf additional HazMat Teams are needed the Palm Beach County Regional Hazardous Materials Response Teams (PBCRHMRT) assits the West Palm Beach Fire Departement with hazardous materials incidents.  The PBCRHMRT has an Emergency Management Plan with supplements the plan of the West Palm Beach Fire Department. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety -- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are to be updated by June 30, 1999 and will include procedures for calibration of the chlorine alarm system, for chlorine leak tests, for operator notification when chlorine is detected and emergency response.  Budgeted for fiscal year 2003 - 2004 is the emclosure of the chlorine storage area and installation of a chlorine scrubber system, which would substanially reduce the liklihood of an offsite chemical incident.",

This guidance complies with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Managenment Program (RMP) regulations, 40 CFR Part 68, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nSection 112( r ) requires facilities which store certain toxic or flammable chemicals above threshold quantities to develop and implement an RMP.  The RMP evaluates the worst case and alternative case release of these chemicals  into the environment and the impact on surrounding human populations and environmental receptors.  The worst case release scenario assumes that all of the toxic substance within a vessel, system or process is released at one time.  The alternative case scenario assumes a smaller, more realistic, release of perhaps on cylinder or container.  The RMP also evaluates the facility's resources to cope with chemical releases.  Although the RMP present worst case and alternative case scenarios, it should be noted that there has never been an incident at the ECRWWTF which resulted in any offsite consequences or injury to human health or the environment.\n\nThe ECRWWTF has an average capacity of 55 millions gallons per day (MGD), with an ultimate treatemnt and disposal capacity og 98 mgd.  The plant site consists of 300 acres.  The plant layout was specifically designed to take advantage of the prevailing southeastern sea breeze.  In this manner any odors created would be dissipated over the plant site and sparsely populated surrounding areas.  The ECRWWTF provides wastewater treatment service to five (5) government entities which participated in it development.  The following are the five (5) entities:  City of West Palm Beach, Town of Palm Beach, City of Riviera Beach, City of La"

The ECRWWTF currently serves 400,000 people in central Plam Beach County and nearby communties.\n\nThe ECRWWTF represents a cumulative investemnt of more than 70 million dollars since its inception in 1970.  The plant has undergone several expansions in its 34-year history.  The original aeration facility was constructed in two (2) stages and completed in 1980.  The original design provided a minimum of 90% biochemcial oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids removal prior to disposal of the effluent by deep well injection.  Between 1980 and 1986 improvements were made to the original facility.  In 1986, a major program was intitiated to reduce annual operating costs and to expand plant capacity.\n\nChlorine is the only chemical used at this facility at quantities above the EPS -- List of Regulated Toxic Substances and Threshold Quantities for Accidental Release Prevention, and thus chlorine is the basis of this RMP.  The ECRWWTF uses chlorine for emergency operations only, it is not used during normal operating conditions.  Chlorine is used in the disinfection phase of the wastewater treatment in times of an emergency.  The liquid effluent which is discharged from the clarifier enters the contact chamber.  At this time the effluent is treated with chlorine gas.  The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound capacity containers as a liquid under pressure., but is discharged in to the wastewater as a gas.  The contact chamber has a series of baffles which ensure that chlorine will have a minimum reaction time or contact time of 15 minutes in order to mix the liquid to kill the pathogenic bacteria in the effluent and complete the disinfection process.\n\nChlorine is one of the chemical elements and is one of the halogens.  Neither gas nor the liquid is explosive or flammable, however, both reactive chemically with many sustances.

At higher levels there is vomiting associated with labored breathing.  In extreme cases difficulty breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from suffocation.\n\nChlorine is also hazardous to the environment.  Chlorine causes bleached spots on leafy palnts due to an attack on chlorophyll in the leaf.  Mammanlian animals suffer many of the same effects as humans exposed to chlorine.  Many forms of aquatic animal life are adversely agffected by chlorine in concentrations well below 0.1 ppm, but harmful concentrations are unlikely unless chlorine is discharged directly in to the water."
