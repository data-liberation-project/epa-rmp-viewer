Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nFlowers Specialty Foods - Montgomery is committed to both the safety of our employees and that of the surrounding public, including both human health and the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful prevention measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our Prevention Program is the minimization of all risks that could possible lead to an accidental release.  This program focuses primarily on the mechanical integrity of the process equipment and the training of its operators.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on minimizing the potential impacts of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Montgomery Fire Department and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n Flowers Specialty Foods - Montgomery is a baked goods manufacturer. \n The regulated substance handled at this plant is propane.  Propane is used as a substitute for natural gas at times when natural gas supply is limited.\n The maximum quantity of propane stored at this facility is 101,000 pounds.\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n Worst-Case Scenario- Failure of the storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 101,000 pounds of propane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 80%.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source, 10% of the release quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of 1psi for the worst-case scenario is 0.38 miles\n Alternative Scenario- A pull-away rupture causing failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch diameter transfer hose.  Excess flow valves function t"

      "SummaryText": "o stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are release and travel to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to this endpoint is less than 320 feet, but has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nFlowers Specialty Foods believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  This facility maintains information about the proper use of its equipment and the possible hazards.  By following set operating procedures and maintenance routines, the process equipment within the facility will continue to operate in optimum condition.  Additionally, the release prevention program is constantly being improved by sustained employee training and regular compliance audits.  Compliance with all applicable state codes and regulations ensures the continued safety of Flowers Specialty Foods.\n\n5. Five-year accident history\n\nFlowers Specialty Foods - Montgomery has not experienced any accidents within the last five years that either led to the release of hazardous chemicals or had the potential to lead to such a release.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nA well-planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release.  Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings.  To this end, Flowers Specialty Foods has coordinated emergency response efforts with the appropriate local agencies and has instructed employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
