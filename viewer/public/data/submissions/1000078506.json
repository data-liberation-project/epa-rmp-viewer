      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\nAirgas USA, LLC operates a propane storage/filling facility with 32 employees in Waukesha, WI. The facility is manned 12-20 hours per day. The Waukesha propane process receives product by propane transport truck that is stored onsite a bulk storage vessel (108,000 lbs / 30,000 gallons) before being transferred into gas cylinders then distributed to customers. Cylinders containing between 20 and 100 lbs of propane are filled on a daily basis. Each is weighed after filling, increasing operational safety. Acetylene is produced on site by the reaction of calcium carbide with water. The process is contained in a generator where acetylene gas is piped to cylinders that have already been filled with acetone. The acetylene must be dissolved in acetone in order to stabilize it. This ratio is determined based on cylinder weight. \n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical:\n\nPropane is stored and transferred on site is listed as a highly hazardous chemical under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The Airgas Waukesha, WI onsite inventory of propane is in excess of 10,000 pounds making the propane process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP covered process. \n\nAcetylene stored and transferred on site is listed as a highly hazardous chemical under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The Airgas Waukesha, WI onsite inventory of acetylene is in excess of 10,000 pounds when dissolved in acetone  in cylinders making the acetylene process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP covered process.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe highly flammable and hazardous nature of propane and acetylene in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.

This Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program. Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Mitigation - Emergency stop buttons to isolate propane sources; personal protective equipment (protective outerwear clothing, intrinsically safe devices, safety glasses, shoes, etc.) (2) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provides isolation for propane process equipment, check valves on propane delivery lines and pressure safety valves for the process piping and vessels. (3) Facility and Environment - Waukesha, WI plant emergency action plan.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation (EP)\n\nAirgas has developed a written plan of action and Waukesha employee/operators are expected to participate in the accidental release prevention program (RMP/PSM). Employees are trained on and provided access to the propane process safety information. Specific actions an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are current, accurate and recommend any necessary changes.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAirgas keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and"

Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these safe operating limits. The Safety Coordinator and Facility Managers are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC). The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also\n\nrepresents a cross-section of the employees working in the process. For future PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Airgas action item database tracking system. Facility Manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (OP)\n\nAirgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous propane and acetylene process operations, such as: (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal operations; (3) unit emergency shutdown; (4) unit normal shutdown and; (5) unit startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown. Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.

Procedures further provide steps for operators to take that will correct or avoid an unsafe deviation. Airgas procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining (TN)\n\nAirgas has implemented a training program for all employee/operators involved in the acetylene and/or propane covered process. All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as: general orientation, facility rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response. In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years. Training is documented and tracked in a local facility matrix and electronically in the Airgas University training system.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nAirgas has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on preventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves and vent systems, controls and interlocks, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5)\n\napplying quality assurance measures. In combination, these written activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.
