These products require an environment, whereby the temperatures are maintained at less than \r\n50 degree Fahrenheit before, during and after processing.  Ammonia is the refrigerant used to maintain this environment to protect the meat products from microorganisms.  This ensures the food safety and quality of the products processed.\r\n\r\nPrevention program:\r\nCopies of the operating procedures relating to liquid AMMONIA system are in the TUR-PAK FOODS and COMPANIES PSM(TOS/SOP) MANUAL, located in the FSRC office.  These procedures address the hazards of AMMONIA and how to safely complete the task.

These employees operate and provide maintenance for the AMMONIA system.  Maintenance conducted by TUR-PAK FOODS and COMPANIES employees consist of routine service, inspections startup and shutdown.  Repair and major maintenance activities are contracted to people with expertise in AMMONIA maintenance.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nThis facilityA\u00bfs employees will not respond to an emergency release scenario of AMMONIA, which could have offsite consequences.

This is based on using an idle Receiver #2 and increasing the ammonia storage in Receiver #1 an additional 25%.  This scenario is based on 7879 lbs. Released within 10 minutes under the worst conditions.  The distance that the toxic endpoint could travel is 0.80 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.
