Comprehensive leak detection monitoring is conducted quarterly.  Compliance with work instructions is audited under ISO 9000.  A comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis, as required under the OSHA PSM program, is conducted every five years.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIn the past five years, the Savannah plant has not had any accidents involving epichlorohydrin that have caused injury or property damage to anyone onsite or offsite. \n\nEmergency Response Program: \nThe Savannah plant has a written emergency response plan that provides step by step procedures for responding to hazardous material emergencies.  The plant maintains a fully equipped in-house Emergency Response Team.  The facility coordinates emergency response matters with the Chatham County Fire Department's Hazmat Team.  Two emergency response contractors, who are knowledgeable of the plant and our operations, are on call 24 hours a day.  In addition, the plant is an active participant in the LEPC and a mutual support group that includes other industries and agencies in Savannah.  In the event of an emergency, the community would be notified by the plant's neighborhood siren, by teleminder (an automated emergency telephone notification system), by local radio & television, and by the Savannah & Garden City Police Department.  The Shelter-in-Place program will be utilized whenever possible and Savannah Hazmat has provided training to the local community."

EPA lookup tables predict the fumes will travel 0.38 miles from the release point before the fume concentration in the air will reach 20 ppm which is considered a safe level.  Approximately 240 residents could be potentially affected by this release. \n\nAlternaitve Case Scenario:\nThe alternative case scenario for epichlorohydrin is a release of the maximum charge of 100% epichlorohydrin from the reactor (10,500 pounds) resulting in the formation of an uncontaminated liquid pool.  Release rate is estimated at 40.3 pounds per minute.  EPA lookup tables predict the fumes will travel 0.19 miles from the release point before the fume concentration in the air will reach 20 ppm, which is considered a safe level.  Approximately 50 residents could be affected by this release.\n\nAccident Prevention:\nWe prevent releases by implementing four layers of protection: designing for safety, maintaining our plant, operating safely, and auditing our operations.  Best engineering practices are used when designing new systems or modifying existing systems.  A hazards analysis is performed prior to any process or equipment change.  Epichlorohydrin is handled in a closed system.  Concrete dikes provide containment for potential spills from tank storage area, transfer pumps, and railcar unloading. Dry disconnects were installed to eliminate spillage at unloading station.  A water blanket is maintained in the containment dike to reduce vapor releases in the event of a spill.  A sealess transfer pump, leak proof valves, and welded transfer lines reduce the potential for fugitive emissions.  Critical equipment is maintained through the preventative maintainence work order system.  An inert nitrogen purge is used to limit flammability during unloading, storage, and reaction. Only qualified, highly trained operators perform operations, inlcuding unloading of epichlorohydrin tankcars.  Emergency response personnel must also be"

All of us are responsible and accountabile for adhering to the letter and spirit of this policy.  All of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily business activities.  It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care Company.\n\nFacility Description:\nHercules is among the world's oldest and largest suppliers of resins and a leading supplier of performance, process, and water treatment solutions to the pulp and paper industry.  The Hercules-Savannah plant has been in operation since 1923. The Savannah plant is a manufacturer of chemical additives to the pulp and paper industry.  For example, epichlorohydrin is used in the production of wet strength resins.  These resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc., so that they will not come apart easily when they get wet.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw mateial for the process and  is consumed in the chemical reaction to make the product.  The  plant receives epichlorohydrin primarily in railroad tank cars and occasionally, in tank trucks.  The epichlorohydrin is stored in a single 279,000 pound (30,000 gallon) tank.  The storage tank is provided with containment which drains into the tank containment dike, providing adequate capacity to contain a full railcar.  A water blanket of 4-6 inches is maintained in the storage tank dike to reduce the potential for the release of epichlorohydrin fumes in the event of a spill or leak into the dike.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario:  \nThe worst case scenario for epichlorohydrin is the catastrophic release of a full storage tank of 100% epichlorohydrin (279,000 lbs) into the containment dike.  The worst case assumes that the entire contents of the tank is release instantaneously.  Only secondary containment is considered in determining the endpoint.  Response by plant personnel and m"
