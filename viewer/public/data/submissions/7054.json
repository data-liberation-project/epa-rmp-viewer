      "SummaryText": "  1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAs stated in our Worldwide Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy and Principles, Borden Chemical, Inc. is committed to health, safety, and environmental excellence.  To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Borden Chemical, Inc. Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe Malvern plant makes phenol-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde resins and formaldehyde solutions.  The site includes a tank farm for storage of formaldehyde (50% solution),  phenol-formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde resin, methanol and phenol as well as three reactors for the production of these resins. Raw materials are received by truck and rail.\n\n    The regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\n    Formaldehyde solution (50%),      950,000 lbs.\n\n3.    Worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario - Formaldehyde\n\nAs a result of a catastrophic event  the formaldehyde tank ruptures, 550,000 gallons of 50% formaldehyde solution spills.  A portion of this is contained on the production area paving and the remainder is absorbed into the surrounding soil.  From the resulting liquid pool, 2,626"

      "SummaryText": ",250 lbs. of formaldehyde evaporates into the atmosphere.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/liter is 0.6 miles.\n\nThe spill would be discovered soon due to the formaldehyde odor.  The release is mitigated by the slope of the unloading area, which directs the spill into a trench and sump.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Formaldehyde\n\nAs a result of a hose failure, 500 gallons of 50% formaldehyde solution spill in the tank truck loading area.  From the resulting liquid pool, 176 lbs. of formaldehyde evaporates into the atmosphere.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/Liter is .31 miles.\n\nThe spill would be discovered soon due to the formaldehyde odor.  By procedure, the unloader remains by the truck during unloading.  The spill is mitigated by the slope of the unloading area, which directs the spill  into a  sump.\n\n4.    Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nThis plant was recently acquired by Borden Chemical, Inc.  They have been provided the Borden Safety Manual and have assigned site safety responsibilities to its personnel.  Monthly safety meetings are being conducted by the Plant Manager.\n                                                                                                                                                                             A Process Safety Management audit has been conducted by Borden Safety personnel.  This audit revealed that some programs such as respirators, lockout/tagout and incident investigation were in place.  Many other programs are now being initiated including hot work and confined space permits as well as a computerized preventive maintenance database.  Operating Guides are being written for each process which will include  process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators will use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference.  \n\n5.    Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five year period fro"

Emergency response program\n\nThe plant does not maintain a corps of trained emergency responders, but relies on the Malvern Fire Department and the Glen Rose Volunteer Fire Department to provide emergency assistance. The plant Emergency Response Plan describes procedures for actual and threatened releases, including coordination with fire department responders.  An emergency response drill is conducted annually to test the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNone"
