All employees receive annual safety training to instruct them in proper emergency response procedures. The Emergency Response Team participates in additional training sessions so that they can safely handle potential emergency situations. Furthermore, the refinery has procedures that address proper use, maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.\n\nThe overall ERP for the refinery is coordinated with the Wayne County LEPC, Detroit LEPC, and local community fire and police departments. These organizations form part of MRD's Incident Command System (ICS), which permits all involved parties to work together safely and effectively in order to bring a favorable outcome to an emergency situation.\nIn order to keep the plan up to date, the emergency response procedures are reviewed at least annually and by subject matter experts. . Any changes implemented are updated in the ERP. Affected personnel are trained in regards to the changes in the ERP.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nMarathon is implementing some projects that are environmental or safety improvements. These projects include a reroute of the crude flare and an NHT heater replacement. \n\nThe refinery constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic reviews and audits, the incident investigation program, analyzing and trending leading and lagging indicators, such as near miss reporting and behavior based safety observations, and soliciting input and suggestions from the employees. \n\nMVPP: As a Star site we are already recognized as a leader in the state.

The incident occurred on September 12, 2019, and involved contract employees bolting up piping spool pieces to two 2-in valves on the discharge piping on the FCC main fractionator slurry pumps.  The bolts on the blind flanges of both 2-in tie-in valves were loosened to confirm there was no pressure.  Approximately one hour after bolt-up work began, a leak occurred on one of the valves, releasing approximately 523 barrels of hot FCC slurry, injuring 2 employees, and causing $250,000 in onsite property damage. Additional information is provided in Section 6 of the RMPlan.\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program Information\n\nMRD maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The purpose of the ERP is to protect personnel and to minimize the impact on the refinery and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation. The plan consists of procedures for responding to such emergencies as fires, explosions, hazardous gas or liquid releases, natural disasters, medical incidents and bomb threats. The plan, along with tactical emergency response procedure, such as pre-fire plans and the boom deployment plans, addresses responsibilities of the Emer"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. These audits may be led by a third party contractor with assistance by refinery employees as required. The findings are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n1.3.1 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP covered processes at the refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios of flammable substances caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes.\n\nRelease Detection\n\nHydrocarbon (LEL) detectors with alarms are located in the pressurized LPG storage and rail car loading area, the crude desalting area and the Coker unit;\n\nFixed hydrogen sulfide (H2S) monitors are located in the sulfur recovery units. All personnel are required to wear personal H2S monitors in all process units and tank farms.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\nProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to control process materials to prevent over pressure damage to equipment;\n\nManual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process;\n\nAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change \n\nMRD has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMRD promptly investigates each incident which results in or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team, which may include contractors, documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and reviews these results with refinery management. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. MPC incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices-\n\nMRD has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel in process areas, (2) Energy Isolation procedures to control hazardous energy sources during the servicing and maintenance of machinery and equipment, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control hot work including welding and other spark-producing activities, a"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews \n\nMRD conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind). The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMRD has well-established practices, programs and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

These procedures are used by qualified operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the refinery operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MRD has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations and specific training on the process they will operate. After a new operator demonstrates through tests and skills demonstration adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 36 months.  Operators are given the opportunity to take part in more frequent refresher training if desired. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nMRD uses contractors to supplement its work force especially during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near pr"

Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. The analyses are led by a person trained in the HAZOP methodology utilizing a team comprised of individuals who have experience in operations, operations supervision, engineering, technical services, and mechanical integrity. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Hazards are also risk ranked to provide a basis for further management of these items.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Health, Environmental, Safety & Security Department.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the refinery periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The PHA Team has considered offsite effects of potential releases as part of all PHA updates completed after August, 1996. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMRD"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in the operation manuals for each process unit. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nMRD also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nMRD has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controll"

Many of these products are flammable mixtures with components that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in the refinery process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. MRD has no toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nMRD performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could affect the public or the environment. The offsite consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. MRD does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the refinery. Release scenario analyses have been submitted to EPA.\n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at MRD. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nMRD encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, incident investigation, and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participati"
