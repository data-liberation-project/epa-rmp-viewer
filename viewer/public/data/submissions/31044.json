If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and/or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at Ag Processing Inc Refinery is the refining of soybean oils. Hydrogen is used to hydrogenate the oil to produce vegetable oils with specific properties and characteristics. The maximum quantity of hydrogen stored is 26,600 pounds.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implementated the required provisions of the Program Level 1 RMP. The facility has also developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program that covers this process, as well as other applicable regulations.\n\n4. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis RMP is being submitted to reflect an increase in storage quantity that will exceed the RMP threshold reporting limit. The process has been in service since January 2001 at quantities less than the threshold quantity, and there have been no accidental releases of hydrogen in the past five years that;\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\n     - have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.
