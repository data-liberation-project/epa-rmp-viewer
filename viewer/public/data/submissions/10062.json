Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of MASON COUNTY SERVICE COMPANY are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute propane.  Propane is used by our customers as a fuel.  Propane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  Propane is distributed to customers by delivery trucks (bobtails).  This facility has equipment for unloading transports and equipment to load bobtails and DOT containers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 110,000 pounds. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the failure of the largest storage tank which, when filled to the maximum amount allowed would release  110,000 pounds of propane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 88% at 60 F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source. 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is .39 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is .06 miles.  This releas"

The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58.  All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the NPGA's Certified Employee Training Program (CEPT).\n\n5. Five year accident history.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n- a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\na. Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
