We use combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees, the public and protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities we have edesigened and implemented. This includes the following.\n\nA description of our facility and uses of EPA's RMP regulated substances at our facility.\nA summary of the results of our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\nA five year history of accidental releases for  substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\nAn overview of our emergency response program.\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases and therefore adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nVopaK Terminal Galena Park Inc. is a for-hire liquid storage terminal and drumming warehouse facility. Chemicals and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the chemicals stored, drummed, handled and transported in this facility. Chemicals are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, tank truck and tank car. At this time the facility plans to drum and store one EPA RMP regulated chemical (Ethylenediamine, CAS # 107-15-3).\n\nAdditions: None\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario(s) and alternative scenario(s) for our facility. The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the exposure distances for the scenarios.\n\nWorst-"

      "SummaryText": "case release scenario - regulated toxic substance \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a regulated toxic substance is the failure of a 4 inch block valve at the railcar loadind spot at the drumming warehouse. The total volume (30,000 gallons) is released to the ground. The scenario assumes a 60 minute release time with worst-case weather conditions. The distance to the toxic endpoint according to the EPA guidelines is 1.1 miles, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. Although controls and mitigation measures are in place to prevent such a ctatstrophe, no credit for passive mitigation was taken into accounnt when formulating this worst-case scenario.\n\nAlternative release scenario - regulated toxic substance\n\nThe alternative release scenario for a regulated toxic substance involves the development of 0.25 inch hole in a flexible transfer hose after unloading 10 percent of the volume (therefore less 3,000 gallons). The remaining volume (27,000 gallons) is lost to the ground in a contained area. The leak is found and the operation is shutdown in 5 minutes. The distance to the the toxic endpoint accordinng to EPA guidelines is 0.1 miles, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECEFIC PRVEVNTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Our management system addresses each each key feature of a successful prevention program. The program includes the following.\n\nProcess safety information\nProcess hazard analysis\nOperarting procedures\nTraining\nMechanical integrity\nManagement of change\nPre-startup review\nCompliance audits\nIncident investigation\nEmployee participation\nHot work permitting\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program are utilized to prevent accidental chemical releases.

With our specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accidental chemical release prevention.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years of any EPA RMP regulated substances.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain various contingency plans which address federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting our employees, the public and the environment during emergencies. Furthermore, we coordinate our plans with the community emergency response plan.\n\nWe are using this information to help ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively manage the hazards that are presented to our employees, the public and the environment.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is alist of improvements that are proposed to be implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or to help better respond to accidental releases."
