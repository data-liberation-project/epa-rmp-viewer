The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The EAP will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nBlythe Energy Center employees conduct ongoing inspections, testing, and replacement of the critical items in the ammonia system and the Aqueous Ammonia SCR DeNOx system.  Both systems are inspected on a daily basis.  A record of the maintenance or work performed on the systems is maintained electronically on-site.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Blythe Energy Center facility is located at 385 N. Buck Boulevard, in Blythe, California.  The facility is approximately 0.61 miles north of Interstate 10 and 1.6 miles west of California Highway 78.  The area surrounding the Blythe Energy Center facility is rural with few commercial businesses surrounding the facility. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances of concern at the Blythe Energy Center facility are anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (29%).  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system that chills the air intake of the combustion turbine electrical generators, thereby increasing their efficiency.  Aqueous ammonia (29%) is used in the SCR DeNOx system to reduce the NOx emission in the exhaust gas stream.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia and 29% aqueous ammonia are 54,975 pounds and 116,000 pounds (16,000 gallons), respectively.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Chiller System:\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses a maximum of 54,975 pounds of ammonia.

      "SummaryText": " anhydrous ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the air intake of a combustion turbine electrical generator.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 65 psig on the low-pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side. \n\n\n\nThe Compressors and Condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for the air intake of a combustion turbine electrical generator.  The system is located primarily in the Engine Room.  The Evaporative Condensers and Relief Valve Water Tank are located outside the Engine Room. \n\n\n\nThe process begins with high pressure liquid ammonia draining from the Condensers to the SOC Receiver.  The SOC Receiver maintains a liquid reservoir for oil cooling of the Screw Compressors (5) via a modulating control valve on the outlet to the Flash Receiver.  The control valve is connected to the liquid level in the vessel, and allows excess liquid to flow to the Flash Receiver, at which point the pressure of the liquid ammonia is partially decreased.  The ammonia vapor produced by this partial drop in pressure is drawn from the receiver through the economizer suction port of the Compressors.  Liquid ammonia is fed from the Flash Receiver to the Pump Receiver package.\n\nThe Pump Receiver uses five pumps to transfer the liquid ammonia to the Combustion Turbine Inlet Chilling System.  Two pumps feed each of the two Chillers, while the fifth pump is reserved for back-up purposes.  At the Chillers, liquid ammonia partially boils as it absorbs heat from the air intake of the combustion turbine.  The resultant liquid/vapor mix returns to the Pump Receiver where liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel and the Compressors pull suction from the top.\n\n\n\nThe energy input to the system is supplied by five Compressors."

      "SummaryText": "  Each Compressor draws main suction from the Pump Receiver and economizer suction from the Flash Receiver.  As the name suggests, the purpose for using economizer suction is to increase the efficiency of the Compressors, thereby reducing their cost of operation.  Liquid injection oil cooling is provided by the SOC Receiver, and all Compressors discharge high pressure vapor to the Condensers which are located outside the Equipment Room.  The Condensers convert the high pressure discharge to liquid by spraying water and fan-blowing air over coils filled with the ammonia vapor.  The resulting high pressure ammonia liquid drains to the SOC Receiver to begin the cycle again.\n\n\n\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.  All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves which are set at 300 psig except for the five pumps, which are set at 150 psig.\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia (29.5%) SCR DeNOx System:\n\n\n\nLiquid (aqueous) ammonia is delivered by truck to the facility, and is stored in a 16,000 gallon tank to the west of the most southern heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  The aqueous ammonia is pumped from the bulk storage tank via underground piping to a vaporous ammonia delivery skid mounted at ground level in the power block.  The skid contains three flow circuits for the mixing of hot flue gas, aqueous ammonia, and compressed air.  A vaporizer is located at the confluence of the three flow circuits. On-skid piping includes a duplex \"Y\"-strainer, a flow control valve, and a block valve.  Manual drains and valves are also available.  Normal flow of the aqueous ammonia is through the Y-strainer, flow control valve, block valve and into a spray nozzle located in the top of the vaporizer where it is vaporized and diluted by the hot flue gas. The vaporized ammonia is then distributed to each of the heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), to remove NOx (oxides of nitrogen) in the exhaust gas stream.\n\n\n\nAll process equipment and piping are "

Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These prevention programs cover those processes that handle anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (29%) above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe facility is manned 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Operators visually inspect the system twice a day, with continuous monitoring of system parameters in the control room. A Preventative Maintenance program in in place for both systems to ensure the integrity of the process equipment is maintained.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System:\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the ammonia system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent through pressure relief valves to a common header which relieves to an outside refrigerant diffusion tank (Relief Valve Water Tank) until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism pr"
