This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: \r\n\r\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\r\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\r\n\r\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\r\n\r\nK. Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nAspen will promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation will be to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences, and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented and investigation reports will be retained for at least 5 years. \r\n\r\nL.
