If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\n\nprepared to work with the Sheffield Fire Department, Franklin Co. Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to\n\npeople and environment.\n\n\n\n2.The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 2036 Olive Ave, Sheffield, IA is the storage and\n\nblending of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for\n\ndirect application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tanks, loading risers associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to\n\nauthorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3.The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is\n\nsecurity-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA\n\nregulations.\n\n\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\n\ncodes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\n\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National\n\nStandards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration\n\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these\n\nregulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention\n\nprogram.\n"
