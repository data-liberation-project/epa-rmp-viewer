DPP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. (DuPont).  DPP was formed on Oct 1, 2010. DPP offers a wide variety of specialty elastomers with end-use applications in automotive systems, wire and cable, construction, chemical processing, the general rubber industry, and in high-performance parts with excellent temperature, oil, and chemical resistance.  Examples of the end products made with DPP specialty elastomers include:\n\nA? Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks;\nA? Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high-performance timing belts;\nA? Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to power transmission cable; and\nA? Industrial applications - from protective gloves, O-rings, and gaskets to microwave door enclosures and chemical-resistant hoses.\n\nThe 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments established a statutory framework for assessing the risks to public health and the environment arising from the use of certain chemicals.  Regulations specifying what facilities must conduct these risk assessments, how to assess the risk, and what data to report were promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  These regulations are known as the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule and are published in Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68). The DPE Chambers Works facility (facility) must comply with applicable sections of 40 CFR 68. This Executive Summary satisfies the RMP rule section 40 CFR A? 68.155 requirements by providing a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities implemented at the facility. Topics include:     \n\nA? the facility's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\nA? a facility descrip"

Corporate and facility goals are to prevent all employee injuries, accidental releases and process safety incidents. The facility has both corporate and local programs, procedures and management practices in place to support these goals. Performance against these goals is constantly assessed and communicated to employees. Achievement of these goals is recognized and rewarded. Failure to attain them is regarded as unacceptable performance and treated accordingly.\n\nThe DPP Chambers Works facility emergency response policy is to coordinate emergency response activities with DuPont's Chambers Works plant on-site emergency response personnel and fire department. Should an accidental release occur, appropriate emergency response actions would be taken to minimize the impact on employee safety, public health and the environment. \n    \nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nThe DPP Chambers Works facility manufactures Viton&reg; and Kalrez&reg; specialty elastomers that are used in industrial, automotive and aerospace applications.

Because of its DuPont heritage at Chambers Works, DPP has a broad base of knowledge for, and experience in, handling toxic and flammable substances at the facility in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  The DPP Chambers Works facility presently has 99 employees. \n\nThree of the substances listed under the RMP regulation are handled at the facility. These substances are:\n\nToxics:\nHydrogen Chloride - Anhydrous (AHCL)\n\nFlammables:\nVinylidene Fluoride (VF2)\nTetrafluoroethylene (TFE)\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nThe RMP rule requires that the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) be communicated to the public for toxic and flammable substances listed in the regulation and present at the facility above a threshold quantity.  The EPA defines the worst-case scenario as the hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical in a 10-minute period. The worst-case scenario assumes the entire quantity is released, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nSince worst-case scenarios are very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the community. To make emergency response planning more effective, alternative release scenarios are used to provide a more realistic picture of what could actually happen if facility safety systems fail. The scenarios described below were developed using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance reference tables or equations. Similar scenario analysis and dispersion modeling has also been used for many years as a routine part of the facility Process Safety Management (PSM) practices.\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario is for Hydrogen Chloride. It assumes the release of the entire storage tank contents (43,000 pounds) with no mitigation. This release has an off site impact per"

This release scenario is unlikely due to the design and construction requirements of the storage tank, and its fitness-for-service inspection program. \n\nThe first alternative-case release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from pressure relief devices due to excess pressure build up within the storage tank. This scenario assumes approximately 1,000 pounds of HCL is released in a 15 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  a storage tank refrigeration system to control tank pressure; control room monitoring of storage tank pressure; storage tank excess pressure alarms; tank refrigeration system failure alarms; storage tank insulation to limit pressure build up rate; controlled venting through a environmental scrubber; and increased process consumption from the tank.   \n\nThe second alternative-case release scenario for Hydrogen Chloride is the discharge from a leak in a tank trailer unloading hose. This scenario assumes approximately 960 pounds of HCL is released in a 30 minute period.  This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include:  requirements for operating personnel to be physically present during tank trailer liquid unloading; leak detection monitors surrounding the unloading area; unloading hose design, construction, and fitness-for-service program; and emergency response planning for this and similar release scenarios. \n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario is for Vinylidene Fluoride. It assumes the release of the entire contents (22,000 pounds) of a tube trailer with no mitigation, and the presence of an ignition source. This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. This scenario is unlikely due to the design, construction and inspection requirements for over-the-road tube trailers"

This scenario assumes 3500 pounds would be released. This release does not have an off site impact per EPA OCA guidelines. Administrative controls and mitigation measures for this scenario include: reduced loading densities during warmer months; procedural trailer pressure monitoring upon arrival and prior to connection for unloading; individual tube isolation until unloading occurs. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nDPP has employed the concepts of accidental release prevention and process safety management since its formation.  Site practices that incorporate these concepts include the following:\n\nA? Thorough understanding of process technology, including the safe limits of the processes and the proper materials of construction for equipment\nA? Proper design and installation of equipment\nA? Systematic process hazard reviews to identify and address process hazards\nA? Written operating and maintenance procedures\nA? Extensive training for all persons who operate or maintain chemical process equipment\nA? Mechanical integrity testing for detection of potential equipment problems and preventive maintenance to avoid releases\nA? Mechanical quality assurance programs to ensure that the correct spare parts are installed whenever maintenance is performed\nA? Procedures to identify and manage both obvious and subtle changes in technology, equipment, and personnel, that could have an effect on the site's safety and environmental performance\nA?

In the case of a chemical release from the facility,  DPP personnel contact the DuPont Chambers Works on-site emergency response personnel and fire department to coordinate emergency response activities.  The DuPont emergency responders are thoroughly trained and properly equipped to respond to releases of any chemical used at Chambers Works.  The site also maintains an emergency response brigade comprised of specially trained operators that can lend additional support if necessary.  \n\nThe DPP Chambers Works facility conducts emergency drills to simulate potential accidental releases and test emergency response plans. Drill critiques are performed to evaluate emergency response plan adequacy and implementation effectiveness.  The DuPont Chambers Works site conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response.\n\nIn addition to these on-site activities, DuPont - Chambers Works also maintains transportation emergency response capability to respond to off site chemical transportation incidents.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAs part of the facility's process hazards review procedures, all of the processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.
