Each day, this WTE facility converts approximately 800 tons municipal solid waste from Stanislaus County and the City of Modesto into electricity.\n\nOne process at the Facility involves the use of a substance regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, thereby requiring the preparation and implementation of an RMP.  This covered process is the NOx control system (discussed in Section 1.1 above), which utilizes anhydrous ammonia injection for NOx control.  Anhydrous ammonia is the reagent utilized in the Facility's NOx control system in order to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, as discussed above. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored under pressure at the Facility.  Administrative controls are used to limit the tank capacity to 87%.\n\nBoth passive and active mitigation measures are used by the Facility to limit the likelihood and/or severity of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Passive mitigation systems do not require human, mechanical or energy input. An example of such passive mitigation is a concrete containment dike, which is installed around the storage tank and vaporizer area.  Conversely, active mitigation systems do require human, mechanical or energy input for initiation.  Leak detectors and alarms, excess flow valves, pressure"

This program is documented in the RMP, and meets the requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\nThe Facility provides process safety information to employees through written materials, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, various operating and maintenance manuals, system descriptions and safety procedures.  Employees attend periodic training and contractors are briefed on process hazards prior to working onsite.  Preventive maintenance and regular inspections are conducted for maintaining mechanical integrity.  Inspections and testing are scheduled through the preventive maintenance program.  Hazard analysis documents are reviewed periodically and updated as required.  Compliance audits are used to evaluate the need for revising or updating the procedures related to the processes.\n\n1.5  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nFor the five years prior to the submission of this RMP, there have been no accidental releases, as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42(a) at the Facility, which resulted in injuries or death to onsite (i.e., Facility or contractor employees) or offsite (i.e., the public).

This EAP has been communicated to the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources (SCDER). Employees who are likely to witness or discover a release have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the Control Room Operator, who will then make the proper notifications to public response agencies. The Facility Hazardous Materials Management Business Plan (HMMBP)Evacuation Plan and Procedures specifically identifies steps to be taken during an ammonia release, including who to call an who/how to manage teh event.\n\nIt is currently CSI's policy that the Facility has received the requisite training and will attempt to secure a release of anhydrous ammonia if the action can be taken without significant risk of injury or death. The Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources (SCDER) is presently responsible for determining when sheltering-in-place or evacuation of off-site areas is necessary, and also for public notification.\n\n1.7  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis RMP incorporates existing Facility procedures, which are designed to improve employee safety awareness and enhance safe operations.

      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY SUMMARY\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has established a regulatory program to prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances that may potentially affect public health and the environment.  The rule (40 CFR Part 68) requires that some 66,000 facilities across the United States in various industries develop a Risk Management Program (RMP).  The RMP incorporates various required elements into a program designed to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and establish emergency response preparedness in the event of an accidental release of such regulated substances.  RMPs must be submitted to the USEPA by the owner or operator of any facility that has a process containing more than a threshold quantity of any of the regulated substances that is covered under the RMP rule.  Pursuant to the RMP rule, Covanta Stanislaus, Inc. (CSI or the Facility) has submitted this RMP for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a commonly used chemical with various applications in industry and agriculture.  By volume, anhydrous ammonia is the fourth largest industrial chemical produced over 80% of which goes to agricultural fertilizers(1).  In addition to anhydrous ammonia application as a fertilizer in crop production, some other common uses for anhydrous ammonia include: air pollution control system reagent, food production and processing, textile and chemical manufacturing, refrigeration (such as refrigerated warehouses) and metal treating.   \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at Covanta Stanislaus, Inc. exclusively as a reagent in the facility's nitrogen oxide (NOx) control system.  The NOx control system is an important part of the Facility's air pollution control equipment that reduces nitrogen oxides to within permitted limits.  Nitrogen oxides are pollutants that contribute to acid rain and photochemical smog.  Nitrogen oxide (NO) is a colorl"

Nitrogen dioxide reacts with water in ambient air to form nitric acid, which contributes to the formation of acid rain; and, nitrogen oxides also contribute to the formation of photochemical smog by reacting with sunlight to form ozone (O3) in the atmosphere.  The Facility's NOx control system reduces nitrogen oxides by the injection of anhydrous ammonia into the furnace section of the boilers.  In the boilers, a reaction takes place between the anhydrous ammonia, nitrogen oxide and oxygen.  The resulting products of this reaction are the major components in the air we breathe, nitrogen gas (N2), oxygen and water.  A significant environmental benefit is achieved through the use of anhydrous ammonia in the operation of the NOx control system.\n\nCSI operates the Facility, which is located in Crows Landing, California in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of CSI employees, contractor employees, the public and the environment.  In addition, the Facility operates in compliance with applicable California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) requirements, federal regulatory requirements and applicable state and/or local requirements.\n\nCSI previously developed a Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for anhydrous ammonia.  The Cal/OSHA PSM rule guides employees in the preventive maintenance, safe management and operation of processes that use regulated substances, and aims to protect employees from accidental releases of these materials onsite.  The USEPA's RMP regulation builds and expands upon the Cal/OSHA PSM program by requiring facilities to evaluate offsite impacts to public and environmental receptors, in the event of an accidental release.  Key elements of the Cal/OSHA PSM program have been incorporated into the USEPA RMP regulation.\n\nAs part of the USEPA RMP effort, CSI has updated the Cal/OSHA"
