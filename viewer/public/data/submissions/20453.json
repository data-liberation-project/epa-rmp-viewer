If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company , or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizers. The maximum quantity stored would be 114,000 pounds in the 26,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity stored would be 114,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM0 is 2.32 miles.The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose.
