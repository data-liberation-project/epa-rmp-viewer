Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle propane which is consider hazardous by the EPA. The same properties that makes propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\n\n\nOur emergency action plan is based upon the Propane Education and Research Council's \"Plant Emergency Planning and Preparedness\" handbook. The facility emergency action plan (EAP)includes but is not limited to; emergency identification and assessment, emergency notification procedures, emergency evacuation procedures, collaboration in emergency management, and EAP distribution and training.The emergency action plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department which will notify any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute propane to wholesale customers. Propane is received by rail car and is stored in forty eight storage tanks piped in a redundant manner. Propane is distributed to wholesale customers by transport vehicles. The facility has equipment to for unloading rail cars and transport vehicles and equipment to to load transport vehicles. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is prop"

The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed would release 160,650 pounds of propane at a time when all contents are emptied. Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 80% at 60 F. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source resulting in an explosion. The distance to endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is .4 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario. A failure causing a piping leak of no larger than 4 inch diameter. The excess flow valves function to stop the flow. The contents of the piping is released for a duration of no longer than five minutes. The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit. The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is less than .3 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), NFPA 58, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are in place to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program. There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of highly hazardous chemicals. Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures i"

All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines. In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operation and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures. \n\n\n\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from reoccurring.

This facility contains an emergency action plan based on the Propane Education and Research Council's Plant Emergency Planning and Preparedness handbook. The emergency action plan establishes actions to take in an emergency by employees and authorized individuals within the facility at the time of an emergency. This facility has worked with the local government emergency management agency to assist in the development of the emergency response needed. The local Emergency Management Agency is responsible for conducting the emergency response program as required.\n\n\n\n7.
