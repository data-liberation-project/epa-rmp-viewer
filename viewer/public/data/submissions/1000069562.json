Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Custom Produce has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Custom Produce, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Custom Produce has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia                15,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to meet CalARP"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is an ammonia detector installed inside the Refrigeration Machinery Room, Rooms 1-6, Precool 1-2, Old Repack Room, Repack Room, and Receiving and Shipping Dock. Each ammonia detector is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nCustom Produce has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Custom Produce facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident "
