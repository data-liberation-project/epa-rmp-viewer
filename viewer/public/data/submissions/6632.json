If a release should occur we are prepared to work with local fire department, medical agencies and law enforcement to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  We also blend dry bulk fertiizers for sale and custom application to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and sold to famers for fertilizer for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored at our location would be 132,000 # in one storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled at any time would be the unloading of a transport carrying 45,000 #.\n\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 112,000 # from our 30,000 gallon storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to the endpoint is .98 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential release is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would be 5000 # in a 2 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint is .28 miles.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM - The facility has excess flow valves, relief valves and manual shutoff valves in place to help prevent accidental releases.  We have also implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility also has training and safety meetings on a regular basis.\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  We have also pro"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY - Safety improvement is an on going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implemention at this time.\n\nJames Hartmangruber\nPlant Manager"
