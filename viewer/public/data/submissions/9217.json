Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies \n\n We at Moline Water Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a\nrelease does occur, we are coordinated with MOLINE FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides\nemergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\n\n The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 22000 lbs.\n                                \n                                \n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up\ntables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n                   Toxic Worst-case analyses\n\n The Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from CHLORINATION.  The scenario\ninvolves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate\n(lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to endpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a\nresidential population of 198,871 within this distance.\n\n\n                Toxic Alternative-case analyses\n\n  Alternative Cas"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention\nSteps\n\n Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. A number of processes at our facility are\nsubject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly\ndescribe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n Moline Water Treatment Plant maintains a record of safety information that describes the\nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes\nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is\nWhat if/ Checklist.   The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise\nin engineering and process operations and are revalidated Bi-Annually.  Any findings related to\nthe hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n For the purposes of safely conducting activ"

These procedures address various\nmodes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency\nshutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n Moline Water Treatment Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\nNew employees receive on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work\nindependently. Refresher training will be provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as\nneeded.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n Moline Water Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process\nequipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes\namong others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls\nand leak detection/alarm system.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel\nwith previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered\nspecialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks\nare corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n Written procedures are in place at Moline Water Treatment Plant to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nany other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are\npromptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes\nare conducted as a regular practice at Moline Water Treatment Pla"

These reviews are\nconducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are\nsuitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n Moline Water Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the\nprovisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at\nleast every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a\nsafe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n Moline Water Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could\nreasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are\nundertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to\nprevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n Moline Water Treatment Plant believes that process safety management and accident prevention\nis a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information\nresulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction\nactivities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is\ncarried out. Moline Water Treatment Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of\nknown potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.
