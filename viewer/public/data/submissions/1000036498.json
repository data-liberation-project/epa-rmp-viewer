      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe City of Modesto - WWTP, Jennings Plant is a secondary treatment plant for wastewater from domestic and industrial sources. The primary wastewater treatment plant design has conventional primary treatment which screens coarse materials, removes grit and floatable organic solids and provides primary clarification.  \n\nConventional secondary treatment at the Jennings Plant removes soluble organic material and additional suspended organic solids. There is a solid handling system with dissolved flotation thickening of the secondary waste water for algae removal. \n\nThe effluent leaving the secondary WWTP contains biological organics. Some of these may be pathogenic (disease causing) organisms. The effluent is disinfected to protect the public health by the use of a chlorine solution provided at the plant by mixing chlorine gas and water. The chlorine contact basin provides retention time for the chlorine to disinfect the treated wastewater. Disinfection of the wastewater is performed prior to discharge to river disposal.\n\nSome residual chlorine is present after disinfection and represents a toxic hazard. The chlorine is neutralized to remove this threat by the addition of sulfur dioxide, i.e., dechlorination of the wastewater is performed prior to discharge to river disposal. The Facility employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination facility utilizing sulfur dioxide. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Modesto - WWTP, Jennings Plant has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination and Dechlorination processes. The City of Modesto's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated su"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary    \n\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one alternative release scenario has been defined for both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\n  \n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the City of Modesto-WWTP, Jennings Plant has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition it should be noted that there are embedded analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine and sulfur dioxide release, including the following: \n\n?    The facility's chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks are located in enclosed buildings.\n\n?    The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems' level instrumentation include an audible/visual alarm, as well as a direct SCADA alarm that automatically alarm in  the River Discharge Station, the Lab Building at the Jennings Plant, and the Main Office at the Sutter Plant.\n\n   \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the City of "

Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no CalARP applicable accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe City of Modesto - WWTP, Jennings Plant facility is a first responding facility in the event of an emergency and therefore has developed and implemented an Emergency Response Plan.  As part of the facility's emergency response effort it maintains a HAZMAT trailer that includes emergency equipment applicable for response activities.  Facility personnel involved with emergency response activities go through annual training as applicable to their duties and responsibilities under the Plan. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. These studies include the following: Process Hazard Analysis and the Seismic Assessment. Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will be completed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nExternal Events Assessment\n\n\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section ?2745.7(l), general events external to the facility that can conceivably cause a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide were addressed by the April 10th 2013 Process Hazard Analysis for the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  Specifically, the external events requirements were met with the following actions:\n\nDescription of the types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.  \n\n?
