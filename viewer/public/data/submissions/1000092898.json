After the aerosol can successfully completes the propellant injection process, it is moved back into the main facility on a conveyer and submersed in a 140-degree Fahrenheit water bath. This process has a two-fold purpose. Along with testing for quality assurance, it provides a safe cushion for propellant release should the quality assurance test fail. If a leak occurs in the seal of the aerosol can, the propellant in the can converts from liquid to gas and vaporizes under water. As a vapor, it rises to the surface and evaporates into the air. A Plexiglas cover protects employees in the area and isolates emissions. \r\n\r\nAerosol cans are also charged with solvent, and some are charged with paint as well. The finished products are labeled, packaged, and cased prior to being staged for shipping. Safe product handling practices are regularly discussed and monitored by all operations personnel. Routine training provides operators with the attitude, awareness, and competency required to safely handle the product.  \r\n\r\n\r\n4. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years. Engineering controls and employee awareness have played a key role in the success of the facility's safety record.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThis facility's Emergency Action Plan includes response actions for site personnel for multiple types of emergencies.  The primary elements of the plan include emergency reporting and evacuation procedures, emergency personnel responsibilities, command of responses, training, and site-specific details such as emergency contacts and maps with pertinent locations illustrated.  Employees are routinely trained on all aspects of emergency response and that training is documented in the paper Health and Safety Files located in the Sheboygan Falls office as well a"

Propellant is pumped from the storage tank to the charging houses as a liquid using a vane pump. Pipes transporting the propellant to the charging houses are insulated for protection from varying weather conditions and the effect they may have on the stability of the propellant. Vegetation is controlled to be sure that the pipes remain visible and in good condition. The charging houses are separate structures located adjacent to the main facility. Notably, the system was designed so that no employees are in the charging houses while the equipment is in operation. This engineering design assists in maintaining safe distance for employees during production.\r\n\r\nThe charging houses are each constructed of aluminum consisting of firewalls and a single relief wall. A check valve in each charging house would prevent a fire from traveling back to the storage tank. As the propellant is injected into the aerosol can in liquid form, it partially converts to gas to fill the vacuum in the can. In the rare event that a can should fail as the propellant is expanding, the contents would be released in the safety and protection of the firewalls of the charging house where ignition sources are minimal, being limited to mechanical operations that are closely monitored. Sensors would detect a release in the charging house and would trigger an audio and visual alarm in the aerosol department that would be seen and heard by employees on both aerosol lines and all employees outside of the aerosol fill room. The visual portion of the alarm is a light on the side of the block room corresponding to the relative charging house. The sensors would also shut down production and immediately start two heavy-duty exhaust fans on the relief wall of the respective charging house. Any release or concentration of propellant would be immediately dissipated. Readings on the alarm system would"

It also is company policy to comply with Federal and State rules and regulations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this facility is to produce aerosol paint cans. A propane/butane mixture under the product name Liquefied Petroleum Gas Blend and trade name AB-80 Aerosol Grade Propellant is used in the operation as the propellant that is charged into the aerosol cans. The maximum amount of propellant stored on site in the bulk tank is approximately 110,000 pounds (lbs) with the tank filled and maintained to no more than 80% maximum capacity by administrative controls. The composition of the propellant blend is approximately 62% propane and 38% butane (by weight).\r\n\r\nAll aerosol cans are also filled with a solvent that is usually flammable such as acetone; therefore, aerosol product cans contain both propellant and solvent.  The maximum inventory of flammables that can be contained within finished product in the product handling and staging areas is 50,000 lbs, inclusive of propellant and solvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility's systems and practices are designed to achieve compliance with EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule, and with related state and local requirements for prevention of accidental chemical releases.   This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, and includes several safety features, as discussed below. \r\n\r\nThe propellant is delivered by bulk tank truck transport and stored in a single 30,000-gallon tank.

The facility is an industrial paint blending operation specializing in color matching, small batch mixing, and custom packaging. This facility does not manufacture raw materials, but instead formulates to customer specifications. The operation produces aerosol paint cans from materials blended at the facility and relies on a significant source of propellant maintained on site. Many of the same properties that make the propellant valuable, also make it necessary to strictly observe safety precautions. Specific details of the operation are discussed in Section 2 below, The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled. \r\n\r\nThe facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been updated and is being resubmitted in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a768.190 to address the following:\r\n\r\n- Revise and update the RMP at least once every five years;\r\n- Reflect the current maximum inventory; \r\n- Update the Offsite Consequence Analysis; and\r\n- Report current data for all prevention program elements and other facility information.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention is inherent within the design of the facility. Felker Truck & Equipment, Inc. (Felker), a leader in the field  of storage tank and delivery systems, constructed the propellant storage tank, and the Wisconsin Department of Commerce, Safety and Buildings Division-Gas Systems completed a review and approval of the tank prior to start of its operation in 2014. \r\n\r\nPropellant must be handled appropriately to reduce potential exposure hazards to employees, visitors, and nearby members of the community.  Safe operation is enhanced by the careful manner of handling propellant, engineering controls at the facility, and effective trai"
