Headquartered in Salisbury,Maryland , the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 14 states. Twenty processing facilities produce about 50 million pounds of poultry products each week. Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 20 largest U.S. grain companies. Perdue also manufactures edible oils, speciality feeds, livestock feed ingredients, and premium pet food ingredients.\n Operations at the Perdue Farms Incorporated Lewiston Complex consists of a poultry processing plant(P-9197), by-products facility, and a vehicle maintenance area. The operation is located at 3539 Governor's Road, Highway 308 West in Lewiston, North Carolina. Perdue Farms Incorporated began operations at this facility February 26, 1976. The facility is located in a rural setting surrounded by farmland and residences which include a public school.\n\nChemical Management Program\n  As a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe working conditions and safe practices. Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain, and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur. Perdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Control and Countermeasures(SPCC) and Process Safety Management(PSM) plans at each operations facility as part of an overall chemical management program. The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, inc"

Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide range of environmental, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\n1. Accidential Release and Emergency Response Policies\n The Lewiston facility is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This committment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is a policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n The primary activities associated with this facility are poultry processing and by-products rendering. As of 12/13/2000 the chlorine gas that was used for disinfection purposes has been reduced to levels below RMP plan thresholds. There is one regulated substance present at the facility. This substance is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for product refrigeration and cooling.\n The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is 66,540 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n The EPA's Risk Management Planning Computation Program via computer program was used to perform off-site consequence analysis, which are as follows:\n The worst-case release scenario submitted for program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release from ammonia. In this scenario 25,000 pounds of ammonia is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1cm. deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n The alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from any compressor room.

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n The facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility maintains a process safety management(PSM) plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nLewiston maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What IF/ Checklist(combined) and HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated yearly, with a regular audit of processes every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/ update was performed on 06/28/1999.\n  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within covered processes, the Lewiston Perdue Farms facility maintains written operating procedures.

Refresher training is provided at least yearly and more frequently as needed.\n  MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nLewiston carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief valves and vents systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n  MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nWritten procedures are in place at the Perdue Lewiston facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. The most recent review/ revision of management of change procedures was performed on 06/24/2000. Process operators, maintenance personell, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to adjust to the modification.\n  PRE-STARTUP REVIEWS\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Perdue Lewiston facility. The most recent review was performed on 07/01/1999.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.
