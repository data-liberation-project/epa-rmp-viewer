The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\nA Risk Management Plan (Plan), as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It consists of a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA that will eventually be uploaded onto a public access data base. The Plan has an Executive Summary that follows a required EPA format, and is intended to inform the public of Victoria SWTP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario each"

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (I, II, or III) Victoria SWTP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Victoria SWTP's Worst-Case release.  Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program III, Victoria SWTP is included in Risk Management Program II.  \n\nWorst Case Scenarios\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) was defined as a ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration, and a 10,000 gallon tank (43,800 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia being released by a catastrophic event within a 10-minute duration.  A mitigation factor of 0.55 was allowed for the chlorine process due to the facility being enclosed in a building or a shed.  This chlorine scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model DEGADIS 2.1. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 1.55 miles.  The anhydrous ammonia scenario was developed using the EPA approved ALOHA Model Reference Tables.  The toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia was determined to be 2.48 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) of chlorine was modeled using DEGADIS 2.1. Source term estimations of approximately 175 pounds of chlorine gas released were derived from a scenario of a failed direct regulator connection. The dispersion model estimated the 3 ppm chlorine footprint to extend to 0.26 miles.  The anhydrous ammonia ARS was developed using the EPA approved ALOHA Model Reference Tables.  Source term estimations of approximately 84 pounds per minute of an anhydrous ammonia liquid/gas mixture released were derived from a scenario of a leak from a pipe or tank truck unloading hose protected by an excess flow valve.

The Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the Risk Management Program Team, described below in Table ES-2.\n\nRisk Management Program Team\nThe following members are responsible for the Risk Management Program development, implementation, and maintenance.

This information was compiled from numerous sources, and is intended to be a one-stop source for the reader seeking data on this substance. The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant processes are modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on the chlorination and ammoniation systems.  Specifications on the process are collocated in one place for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section.  Used as a training reference, together with the Process Schematic located in the Appendix, the reader will readily understand the function and operation of the chlorination system.\n\nHazard Review\nA Hazard Review was conducted for the chlorination and ammoniation systems. The team consisted of facility management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside persons knowledgeable on chlorination system design, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a \"What If\" analysis. The \"What If\" was developed from HAZOP experience at similar treatment processes.\n\nRecommendations\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement. The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Victoria to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.  \nPlease note that these are not the reco"

The City of Victoria should be interested in container hydrostatic testing, and pre-shipment inspection.  Look for inspection reports from appropriate oversight agencies. \nIf at all possible, it was recommended to investigate contractual control over the vendor. In other words, use contract language and specifications to ensure delivery of safe ton containers along with high-quality chlorine, as well safe delivery of high-quality ammonia.  This policy will hold the supplier responsible for liability and monetary damages associated with defective ton containers and / or poor quality chlorine or anhydrous ammonia.  \nEnsure maintenance procedures are updated with operational inspections of equipment.  \n\nTraining Recommendations\nCertain hazards reviewed can be mitigated through training. The following were highlighted during the Hazard Review as particularly important to operating / maintenance personnel, and the community.\nEnsure CityA?s Emergency Response policy is properly trained and implemented. Coordinate with the Fire Department to ensure they are adequately trained and equipped for a HazMat (chlorine and ammonia) response. Ensure select operators have adequate training to assist the Fire Department.
