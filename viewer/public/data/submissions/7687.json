The chlorination process consists\nof the use of chlorine from one-ton cylinders to treat potable water in a standard chlorine disinfection\nsystem.\n\nThe hazard assessment was performed on the chlorination process using the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM Model.  The worst-case release scenario\nwas assumed to be the release of a one ton cylinder over a 10 minute period.  The alternative release\nscenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed during the process hazard review\nand analysis.  In this scenario, a 0.25-inch diameter orifice is formed in a one-ton cylinder as the\nresult of a poor bond between the lead alloy and the fusible plug retainer.  The Facility has the\ncapability of responding to and stopping the leak within 30 minutes of detection.  For both scenarios,\nthe off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors could be potentially impacted by\nthe release of chlorine.  Although off-site areas would be impacted, the Facility believes that safety\nprocedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for off-site consequences and\nsubsequent risks to the surrounding community.  The Facility's safety devices include chlorine leak\ndetectors, alarms, and an automatic system shut-off feature triggered by a loss in system vacuum. \n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), the Facility has\ndeveloped an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for the Facility. The\naccidental release prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the\nOccupational Safety and "

The prevention program ensures that the Facility is operated under safe conditions and that\nany risk of an accidental release of chlorine is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce\nthe potential of an accidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at the Facility.  In\norder to help prevent the release of chlorine due to human error, the Facility's prevention program\nensures that operating procedures are current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part\nin the Facility's program.  Employees and contractors working near or on the chlorination process\nare required to be trained in the chlorination process and the hazards of chlorine.   \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, the program ensures that equipment\ninspections, tests, and preventive maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted\nengineering practices, manufacturer's recommendations, and planned maintenance schedules.  All\nchlorine cylinders are examined upon delivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In\naddition, equipment pertaining to the chlorine process is visually inspected daily.  The potential for\na chlorine release is greatly reduced in the chlorination process due to the use of a vacuum system\nfrom the point of chlorine withdrawal to its point of application.  In the event that there is a failure\nin chlorination equipment, the system will automatically shut down (i.e. failsafe).  \n\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination equipment have been designed according to applicable\nstandards and codes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection\nand tests.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested,\nthat all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the"
