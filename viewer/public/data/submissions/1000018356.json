ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\nJoseph's Gourmet Pasta & Sauces (Joseph's) recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment from a harmful ammonia release. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of ammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all Joseph's personnel who operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nJoseph's PSM/RM program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RM program standards into its ammonia operating and management systems. The Engineering & Maintenance Manager has overall responsibility for the PSM/RM program.\n\n\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nJoseph's operates an ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, and Heat Treating. \n\n\nIII. SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by EPA RM Program regulation.  The information is considered to be sensitive and is not included in this submission.\n\n\nIV. DESCRIPTION OF THE JOSEPH'S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nJoseph's has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The ammonia prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compli"
