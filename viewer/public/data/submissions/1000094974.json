      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis is the 2018 Updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Univar Solutions USA, Inc. \n\n(Univar) branch located at 8500 W 68th St, Bedford Park, IL, 60501-1844 (0913 Warehouse).\n\n\n\nIt is to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in the \n\nFederal Code of Regulations (40 CFR Part 68). The RMP registration required under Section 68.160 of the Federal regulations is included in Appendix D.\n\n\n\nUnivar Solutions USA is a wholesale chemical distributor serving several U.S. industries. Founded \n\nin 1924, Univar supplied the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest \n\nproducts, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings, and many other critical sectors with the \n\nchemical raw materials and support services required or refine products used in numerous end-use \n\nmarkets.\n\n\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by the Branch are subject to the Federal RMP regulations. \n\nTherefore, a vital requirement of this program is the preparation and submission of an RMP. The \n\nFederal EPA prescribes the content of the RMP.\n\n\n\nThe current required 5-year update includes one process for formaldehyde. Therefore, the basis for \n\nthe following modification includes formaldehyde warehousing, which is a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nUnivar Solutions USA Inc. has opted out of the RMP coverage exclusion for formaldehyde under 40 CFR \n\n68.115(b)(1). Despite the fact that the partial pressure of the material in the solution is less than 10 \n\nmillimeters of mercury (mm Hg), Univar Solutions USA Inc. has elected to keep the warehousing of formaldehyde in the current 5-year update regulated process.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nUnivar Solutions USA Inc.'s accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, \n\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Branch, which demonstrates the facility's\n\ncommitment"
