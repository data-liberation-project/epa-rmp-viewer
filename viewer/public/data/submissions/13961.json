Accidental Release prevention and emergency response policies:\n \nColes Quality Foods, Inc.  facility in Muskegon, MI  uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  This        chemical is considered hazardous by the EPA and necessitates the highest level of operation and maintenance management to safely handle this chemical.  The use of ammonia is generally safe provided appropriate maintenance and operating controls are exercised.  The personal health and safety of our employees and that of our neighbors has always been of primary importance.  To the greatest degree possible, Coles management provides all mechanical and physical equipment required for personal safety and health, in keeping with the highest standards in our industry.\n \nThe emergency response program is a cooperative effort between on-site response detection equipment, personnel and governmental authorities.  The emergency response plan includes notification of plant personnel, local off-site emergency responders and potentially affected neighbors for emergency situations.\n \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled: \n \nThis facility is primarily involved with  the baking of bread products.  It is in operation five to seven days per week.  The product must be refrigerated and/or frozen to provide a quality product to our customers.  As described above, we use an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to accomplish this need.  The system is a closed loop process and does not normally necessitate re-filling or unloading of ammonia.  Access to the entire facility is controlled and further access to the ammonia process is limited to authorized employees and approved contractors. \n \nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammon"

      "SummaryText": "ia contained in the process is 14,000 lbs.\n \n \n3. The worst case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n\n* Worst-case Scenario  Failure of the high pressure receiver and subsequent release of entire contents of ammonia in the system would release 14,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (200 ppm) is 1.33 miles. \n\n* Alternative Scenario  A failure of a flange or pipe on the high pressure portion of the system resulting in a release of liquid anhydrous ammonia from a <\" orifice.  Ammonia detection systems would immediately notify personnel and low pressure interlocks would limit the loss of ammonia.   The distance to the endpoint (200 ppm) would be 450 feet or 0.85 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n4.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n \n The ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1990 and designed and constructed in accordance to ANSI/ASHRAE 15  1989.  The system utilizes a computer run control process to reduce the possibility of human error and the computer monitors the operation of the process continually.  The computerized detection system automatically sounds an alarm in the facility and automatically notifies the site emergency coordinator.  In addition, a security company monitors the system 24 hours a day, seven days a week for any abnormal conditions.  \n \n A specialized refrigeration maintenance contractor is responsible for maintaining the system to the highest standards while Coles maintenance personnel continually check the operation and status of the system.  \n \n \n 5. Five-year accident history\n \n We have not had a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n \n \n 6. The emergency response program:\n \n The emergency response program is based on both on-site and off-site emergency response plans.  These plans are coordinated through the local emergency planning committee.  The Emergency respons"

Each of these units have been on-site and toured the facility including a review of all pertinent facts about the system and hazards.  \n \n7. Planned  changes to improve safety:\n\nDuring 1999 we have increased our schedule of preventative maintenance activities to meet the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration recommendations.  Also, additional ammonia monitoring will be installed and on-site emergency response drills are set with the Muskegon Fire Dept. for the third quarter of 1999."
