      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nFerndale Terminal\nExecutive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES     \n\nThe Texaco Ferndale Terminal has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES     \n\nThe Ferndale Terminal is located west of Ferndale, Washington along the Straight of Georgia waters.  The Terminal serves as a storage facility for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propane and butane), receiving and sending these products via railcar, truck, pipeline and ship. The Terminal is able to store enough of both propane and butane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n The worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Terminal occurs if the largest refrigerated storage vessel fails catastrophically, releases the contents and the contents are subsequently ignited. This vapor cloud explosion would create a 1-psi overpressure at a maximum distance of 3.6 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThree alternative release scenarios (ARS) for flammable substances at the Terminal are developed as more realistic events and are practical for use in emergency planning and response. \n\nThe first ACS assumes the ship loading connection fails catastrophically and it takes 1 minute for the emergency valve "

The butane that has leaked out in that minute is ignited and the ensuing fire generates a heat radiation endpoint of 5-kilowatts/square meter at a distance of 0.18 miles away.  Precautions are taken to prevent this event.  Once activated, the emergency valve is designed to close in less than 30 seconds and this closure is tested prior to the loading of each ship.  The loading arm is pressurized with a benign gas, such as nitrogen, before each ship to check for leaks or potential problems. \n\nThe second ACS assumes the largest non-refrigerated storage tank at the facility catastrophically fails, releases its contents and the vapors are then ignited in a vapor cloud explosion.  The endpoint of 1-psi overpressure is calculated to be 0.31 miles away from the point of ignition.  Our vessels are inspected regularly for signs of corrosion and are designed under the ASME code to be capable of containing the propane.\n\nThe third ACS assumes one of the pipelines entering the facility completely fails and releases its contents for 10 minutes before the flow can be shut off.  The released propane is vaporized and then ignited in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The endpoint of the 1-psi overpressure is 0.28 miles away.  \n\nAll of the cases were modeled using RMP Comp.  RMP Comp was recommended by the EPA for calculating the release scenarios.\n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n    \n     The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Terminal. Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n    \n    Employee Participation\n    \n    The Terminal encourages employees to participa"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n    \n    In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management.\n    \n    Process Safety Information\n    \n    The Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n    \n    Operating Procedures\n    \n    The Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
