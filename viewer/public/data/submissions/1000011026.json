This is accomplished by developing site specific programs that address EHS&S issues.  These issues are addressed in management accountabilities to assure their effectiveness.  The environmental , health, safety and security leadership team is one example of this commitment.\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled\n\n\n\nEAGLE US 2, LLC - La Porte produces and stores alkyl chloroformates, organic acid chlorides and various specialty chemicals.  The facility produces phosgene on demand for use as a raw material in its' manufacturing processes and stores chlorine on-site in railcars.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nLa Porte complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule (29 CFR 1910.119), as well as applicable TCEQ,USEPA and DOT Requirements.  In addition to the above referenced programs there are a number of pro-active facility specific activities designed to reduce the number and severity of incidents at the plant.\n\nThe facility has installed multi-point gas release detectors in the various production units and a fence line gas release detection network. This network has been upgraded on two occasions the most recent completed in 2013.  In addition, the site monitors more than 20,000 connections each quarter to detect and quantify fugitive emission sources. The facility phosgene header is monitored on a monthly basis to comply with USEPA regulations found in NSPS Subpart VV.\n\n\n\nTrained personnel and environment, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the La Porte operation.

These standards include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system, and computer controls for the processes.  Every individual in the facility receives training commensurate with their job responsibilities.  Training may consist of an overview of the plant safety signals given to visitors, a process and hazards overview for contractors before they begin working in a unit, or job-related training and testing for an operator or supervisor prior to assuming their duties. Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as necessary.  Safety, environmental, operating, and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.  \n\n\n\nThe La Porte facility has a comprehensive maintenance and inspection program that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared imaging, inspections by insurance specialists and root-cause analysis procedures.  Piping is inspected and tested according to best management practices prior to installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring and thick"
