The manufacturing processes include the full spectrum from raw ingredients handling and processing to the shipping of finished products ready for the consumer.  Processing that is done at this facility includes bean and nut roasting, chocolate processing, chocolate products moulding, packaging, storage, and rail/truck shipping.  The regulated substance for this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is used for cooling purposes in various stages of the manufacturing operation. The anhydrous ammonia process has a total system capacity of approximately 120,000 pounds.\n\nHershey Foods has implemented numerous programs that demonstrate the company's philosophy of supporting a safe work environment and utilizing operating principles for sound environmental management of the manufacturing operations.  The company has established a corporate Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Steering Committee which is chaired by the Vice President, Manufacturing.  The steering committee develops EHS policies and procedures as well as safety and environmental training programs which are implemented company-wide to ensure consistency of the programs.  \n\nHershey Foods training programs go beyond standard mandated training.  Training programs currently being conducted range from general safety and environmental awareness for all employees to comprehensive, program specific training sessions for target groups based on job requirements.  Training, which is conducted in classrooms and on-the-job is documented and employees are often evaluated through a competency testing program.  Written programs have been implemented which include specific action to be taken by facility employees as well as emergency response personnel in the event of an emergency or accident in the facility.

In addition, adherence to formal preventive maintenance programs and testing parameters for anhydrous ammonia systems is monitored and documented.  A Chemical Review Committee at the facility reviews and approves all new chemical use and ensures that chemical specific training is conducted if necessary.   The Hershey Plant has an Integrated Contingency Plan that should be referenced for details on the emergency response plan.  The facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases and there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP). \n\nThis facility also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management standards (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\nThe facility is situated on 37 acres, located just east of downtown Hershey, in Derry Township, Dauphin County, PA.  Adjacent properties are typically residential, light commercial and agricultural uses.\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves the unmitigated release of the contents of the largest chiller at the plant; in this case the release amounts to 5,917 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This scenario assumes that the chiller fails in a catastrophic manner and the entire contents are released to the atmosphere in a period of ten (10) minutes. The release is assumed to occur under the worst case meteorological conditions of F Stability and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second. \n\nThe Worst Case Impact Area is nine tenths (0.9) of a mile in radius, based on urban topography.
