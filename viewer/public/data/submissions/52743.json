Dodge, Iowa\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR \nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMPlan)\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\nKoch Nitrogen Company (KNC) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKNC\u00bfs Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nHydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and urea ammon"

Hydrochloric and nitric acid are below the minimum concentration necessary to be considered an RMP substance.  According to 40 CFR 68.130 Table 1, nitric acid must be at a concentration of 80%, or greater; and hydrochloric acid must be at a concentration of 37%, or greater, to be considered an RMP substance.  Urea ammonium nitrate is a mixture that does not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making this product exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00bf Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00bf Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00bf Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of interrupting the combustio"

Dodge Nitrogen Plant has experienced four incidents that are reportable under the five-year accident history of the RMP regulation.  Three of these incidents (July 2003, November 2003, and January 2005) resulted in a reportable injury.  One incident (April 2008) resulted in environmental impacts when ammonia entered a waterbody.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant with the Webster County LEPC and the Webster County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be Trinity Regional Hospital, the Iowa Highway Patrol, Cornbelt Power and Northern Natural Gas.  The Ft.

A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00bfThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\u00bfIncident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective measures are taken, if necessary, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u00bfInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u00bfAn ongoing dialogue with the Webster County Emergency Management Director or his designee will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to imple"
