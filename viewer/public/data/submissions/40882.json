The Plant address is 26 Maple Avenue, Bloomfield, NY 14469.  \n\nThe Regulated Substance (RS) used at the Commodore facility is isopentane.  The isopentane is used in the formation of foam products at the facility.  Figure 2 provides a detailed processing layout of the Commodore Operations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAccidental release prevention at the Commodore Plant begins with the delivery of isopentane.  A detailed delivery procedure, summarized in Section 6.0 of this RMP, provides a system of reducing the likelihood of accidental releases and a system of minimizing the impacts associated with a potential release during delivery.  In addition routine maintenance and inspections of the isopentane system provides a means of identifying potentially hazardous situations before such hazards become accidents.\n\nIn the event an accidental release does occur, Commodore facility maintains a functional emergency response plan, which can be easily implemented to contain, mitigate, and remediate the accidental release before posing a significant public hazard.  Emergency response policies include routine and refresher training and exercises in regulated substance handling, normal and abnormal system operation, clean up, disposal, and emergency response.  \n\nWorst-case release scenario ? Vapor Cloud Explosion\n\nThe RMP regulation defines the worst-case scenario to be analyzed at all regulated facilities.   For flammable substances, such as isopentane, the worst-case release results in a vapor cloud containing the total quantity of the substance that could be released from a vessel.  For the worst-case consequence analysis, it is assumed that the vapor cloud detonates.  \n\nThe nearest off-site receptor is the Bloomfield Elementary School located 1320 feet directly so"

      "SummaryText": "utheast of the isopentane tank.  The RMP*Comp calculation estimates the detonation distance at 0.2 miles or 1,056 feet.  This is prior to the distance of the nearest public receptor, the Bloomfield Elementary School.  Therefore, Commodore is required to meet the elements of Program 1.\n\nAlternative release scenario ? Pool Fire\n\nThe RMP regulation defines the alternative release scenario to be analyzed at all regulated facilities as a release scenario ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario?.  Identification of the alternative release scenario in the instance of a pool fire is due to a release from a hole in the storage tank.  \n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBulk storage tanks are located on a concrete pad.  Currently, there is no containment to hold a spill.  However, daily visual inspection checks of the tanks are in place to minimize impact to the environment.  Furthermore, delivery truck containment was is in the design process to collect and contain any spillage during off-loading of isopentane from delivery truck to bulk storage tank.  Additional safety features and policies are described throughout this RMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Plant began commercial operation in 1994, and there has been no accident history involving isopentane.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nA copy of the facility?s Emergency Response Program is in part of the RMP document."
