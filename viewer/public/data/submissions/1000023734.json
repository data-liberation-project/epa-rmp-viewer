      "SummaryText": "Balto Industries is a small business with two full-time employees.  Our commitment to safety is exhibited by over thirty years of continuous business without on offsite accident.  Our safety procedures are time-proven methods of industry standards along with experienced operators.\n\nThe site itself is roughly two acres in , with an office in front with a shed directly behind.\n\nThe tank itself is situated in the northwest corner of the property and is protected on the back by a six foot chain link fence.  The front of the tank is protected by the west side of the storage shed.  The north side is protected by another six foot chain link fence.  The southern side of the tank is open and all bulk deliveries are made in this area.  This area of the tank is protected by an I-beam skid which runs the entire length of the tank.\n\nThe storage tank is a 12,000 gallon ammonia tank with an attached corken compressor.\n\nBalto's business is ammonia distribution.  (To oversimplify, we receive a bulk load of ammonia, approximately 39,000 pounds, then disperse that around Colorado in various amounts, in bulk and cylinders.)\n\nBalto's business is primarily distribution.  All of our ammonia is used industrially, with the bulk of it used for refrigeration.  I must add now that ammonia was the first successful refrigerant and because of that, safety has had the benefit of well over a hundred and fifty years of tried and true handling procedures.\n\nThe ammonia is transferred from a storage vessel (12,000 gallons), to either a smaller vessel (500 gallons), or cylinders, \"not unlike a propane cylinder.\"  That smaller vessel, \"mounted on a one-ton truck,\" then leaves the property and delivers the product to various customers.  The cylinders are delivered as well.\n\nThe transfer of ammonia is accomplished through ammonia hoses with the aid of a compressor.  The cylinders are filled through the same hoses but with the aid of a pump.  The cylinders are then stored under a shed.\n\nWe have planned for"

The one-inch diameter hose is twenty-feet long and holds approximately ten pounds of ammonia.  The hose ruptures due to either a drive away, \"a truck driving off while the hoses are still hooked up,\" or a hose rupture.  As soon as the hose ruptures, one of the built-in safety features activates, \"the excess flow,\" and the leak is isolated to the volume of the hose.  The ten pounds of ammonia vaporizes and produces a cloud which covers an area of .13 miles or approximately 230 yards or 115 yards from the center.\n\nIn the worst case, the fire department would be called and the immediate area would be evacuated and isolated until the cloud dispersed.  The second scenario would not have offsite impact and would be isolated by turning off valves and repairing the ruptured hose.\n\nBy anticipating accidents, the majority can be avoided.  Many of the safety procedures of the industry require the replacement of hoses, \"every five years.\"  This is the weakest link in the chain and by replacing hoses every five years, the strength and safety is assured.  Most of our valves are used everyday and are under constant scrutiny.  If there is a problem, it is fixed.  The excess flow valves, \"which are internal,\" are checked by opening a valve quickly which approximates a ruptured hose.\n\nBalto only has two full-time employees and they have been in business, doing this very same thing since 1969, and I am proud to say, without an offsite accident.\n\nOur response program consists mostly of isolating our facility and notifying the fire department and other local emergency responders.  With only two employees, who have worked together over thirty years, the on-the-job experience in hand with safety clas"
