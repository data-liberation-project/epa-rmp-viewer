Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter 0.0. The table items result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, Seismic Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some recommendation items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. \n\nBased on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."

      "SummaryText": "dix 16 - Incident Investigation of the RMP Binder.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Pressure vessels have float switches that control the liquid levels in the vessels. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves, which are tied to an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure release to the ambient. All cold rooms are monitored by an ammonia detection system for unsafe ammonia concentration levels. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nTrue Leaf Farms Yuma #2 had no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nTrue Leaf Farms Yuma #2 facility is a Non-Responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to the RMP Program Coordinator. The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders"

      "SummaryText": "is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder.\n\nFacility operates seasonally from approximately mid-November through mid-April. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high-pressure receiver during the off season. Facility does not have refrigeration machinery room and all of the refrigeration equipment except cold room fan coils are located outdoors.\n\nThe total ammonia charge of the refrigeration system at the facility is approximately 17,000 lb. Refrigeration drawings that shows P&IDs, refrigeration equipment and piping layout are located in the Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 (Refrigeration System Drawings) of the RMP Binder. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTrue Leaf Farms Yuma #2 facility maintains a release prevention program to prevent or mitigate releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appen"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTrue Leaf Farms Yuma #2 facility conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response.\n\nOn-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nTrue Leaf Farms Yuma #2 uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. The ammonia system is used for cold storage, pressure cooling, vacuum cooling, and water chilling operations. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed equipment includes pressure vessels, cold room evaporators, pressure cooler coils, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tanks. Portable equipment consist of high-side refrigeration trailers (evaporative condenser, screw compressor, high-pressure receiver), compressor skids, one (1) full-car vacuum tube and three (3) half car vacuum tubes. The refrigeration system at this facility"
