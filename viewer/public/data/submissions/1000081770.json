California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the process hazard analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the hazard assessment.\n\n\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\n\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  California Dairies, Fresno Processing Plant interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond "

The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\n\n\nThe facility shall coordinate with outside parties through drills. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency.  In addition, Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release.\n\n\n\nDetailed plans have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  Under the best circumstances, all areas (zones) inside the building should be brought under control within 20 minutes of an ammonia release or breakdown, if personnel are on site.  Small releases should be brought under control immediately.  \n\n\n\nThe plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the system.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified.  \n\n\n\nFacility hazardous material personnel do not enter an IDLH condition which is currently 300 ppm for ammonia.
