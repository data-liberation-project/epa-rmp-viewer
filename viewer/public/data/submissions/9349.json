Furthermore, coordination of the Plan with the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is an integral part of the verificaiton process.\nAs well, El Dorado Chemical Company purchased a computer-based emergency notification system, the Communicator, for the city of El Dorado, which has the ability to notify Union County, Arkansas residents.  This system was purchased at a cost of $42,000 and provides state of the art notification capabilities in the event of an industrial incident or severe weather situation.\n\n7.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEl Dorado Chemical Company is actively promoting public awareness and education programs concerning emergency response through the Union County LEPC and Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  This enhances the public's ability to respond in a given emergency situation.  El Dorado Chemical Company continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  A list of proposed future improvements is as follows:\n\nPre-programmed shelter-in-place messages (for regulated substances) through the computerized emergency notification system known as the Communicator\n\nContinued emergency training for personnel working within hazardous areas of the facility\n\nImproved secondary containment for acid storage areas\n\nNew wastewater neutralization system\n\nReverse osmosis unit for boiler feed water system\n\nIn conclusion, El Dorado Chemical Company realizes worthwhile improvements are necessary and these are just several of the steps we plan to take as a company in continuously improving our safety and emergency response capabilities.\n\n8.0 CERTIFICATION\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.185, I certify that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the Risk Management Plan information submitted is true, accurate, and complete."

Refresher training is provided continuously for operator certification.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEl Dorado Chemical Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Trained maintenance personnel and our mechanical integrity engineer conduct the process maintenance activities.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at El Dorado Chemical Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly trained, and are an integrated part of the change order process.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at El Dorado Chemical Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEl Dorado Chemical Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule a"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEl Dorado Chemical Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  An employee coordinated Behavioral Science Technology Program (BST) also plays a key role in reducing accidents related to safety within the plant, utilizing observaiton which provides soon, certain, and positive feedback.\n\nContractor Training\nOn occasion, El Dorado Chemical Company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes.  A contractor work permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.0 FIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe following is a brief summary of significant accidental chemi"

This act of nature blew the top section of a partially constructed tank into a nitric acid transfer pump's suction line causing the line to rupture.  Although the release of the product was significant, it was contained and neutralized with sodium carbonate at the point of origin and diverted to the wastewater treatment system.  Some fuming occurred from the addition of sodium carbonate for neutralization purposes and local authorities initiated an evacuation as a precautionary measure.  The evacuation was soon cancelled, since the release was quickly and safely mitigated by El Dorado Chemical Company employees, who followed the guidelines in our Emergency Response Plan.  Although an evacuation was initiated as a precautionary measure by local authorities, the release did not result in on-site or off-site deaths, injuries, significant property or environmental damage.\n\nAmmonia:  During the past five years, El Dorado Chemical Company has not had an accidental ammonia release, which resulted in on-site or off-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place notifications.\n\nChlorine:  During the past five years, El Dorado Chemical Company has not had an accidental chlorine release, which resulted in on-site or off-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place notifications.\n\n6.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEl Dorado Chemical Company maintains an Emergency Response Plan, which is based on a similar format to EPA's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), consolidating all of the various Federal and State regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

This API 650 tank is inspected on a scheduled basis utilizing an ultra-sonic testing method, which verifies the mechanical integrity of the tank.  The tank is double walled and contains 30 inches of insulation between the inner and outer shells, creating a safeguard or barrier that virtually eliminates the risk associated with a complete and or sudden rupture of the vessel.  The worst case was developed using Class F atmospheric stability (1.5 m/s wind speed conditions) and does not account for any active mitigation measures.  Furthermore, we have not experienced an ammonia release from this tank since purchasing the facility from Monsanto Corporation in 1983.  Related data is as follows:\n\nRelease Rate -                                                     143,000 lbs/min\nDuration of Release -                                           10 minutes\nMete"
