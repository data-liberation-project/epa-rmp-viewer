We use a\ncombination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. El Dorado\nChemical Company maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have \ndesigned and implemented, including the following:\n\nA description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process,\nwhich are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Planning (RMP) Regulation.\n\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases.\n\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\nA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP rule.\n\nAn overview of the Emergency Response Program.\n\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from \noccurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe certifications that EPA requires us to provide, with regard to RMP.\n\nThe detailed information (called data elements) about our Risk Management Program.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility's primary activity involves the production of ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid.

This API 650 tank is inspected on a scheduled basis utilizing an ultra-sonic testing method, which verifies the mechanical integrity of the tank.  The tank is double walled and contains 30 inches of insulation between the inner and outer shells, creating a safeguard or barrier that virtually eliminates the risk associated with a complete and or sudden rupture of the vessel.  The worst case was developed using Class F atmospheric stability (1.5 m/s wind speed conditions) and does not account for any active mitigation measures.  Furthermore, we have not experienced an ammonia release from this tank since purchasing the facility from Monsanto Corporation in 1983.  Related data is as follows:\n\nRelease Rate -                                                     143,000 lbs/min\nDuration of Release -                                           10 minutes\nMete"

This act of nature blew the top section of a partially constructed tank into a nitric acid transfer pump's suction line causing the line to rupture.  Although the release of the product was significant, it was contained and neutralized with sodium carbonate at the point of origin and diverted to the wastewater treatment system.  Some fuming occurred from the addition of sodium carbonate for neutralization purposes and local authorities initiated an evacuation as a precautionary measure.  The evacuation was soon cancelled, since the release was quickly and safely mitigated by El Dorado Chemical Company employees, who followed the guidelines in our Emergency Response Plan.  Although an evacuation was initiated as a precautionary measure by local authorities, the release did not result in on-site or off-site deaths, injuries, significant property or environmental damage.\n\nAmmonia:  During the past five years, El Dorado Chemical Company has not had an accidental ammonia release, which resulted in on-site or off-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place notifications.\n\nChlorine:  During the past five years, El Dorado Chemical Company has not had an accidental chlorine release, which resulted in on-site or off-site deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, off-site evacuation, or sheltering in place notifications.\n\n6.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEl Dorado Chemical Company maintains an Emergency Response Plan, which is based on a similar format to EPA's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), consolidating all of the various Federal and State regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
