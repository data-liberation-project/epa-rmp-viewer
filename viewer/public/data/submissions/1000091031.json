The specific changes associated with this RMP update include:\n\n\n\n- Adding Mixed Pentane Blend Intermodal Transfers from Rail Cars into ISO Tank Containers at an existing RMP Covered Process, which previously applied only to Isopentane Intermodal Transfers.  n-Pentane represents a new regulated flammable substance present in the Mixed Pentane Blend to be handled at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \n\n\n\n- Removing Vinyl Acetate Monomer (\"VAM\") storage in Stolthaven Houston Tank P40-1 from the RMP. VAM is no longer stored and transferred from this tank.  \n\n\n\n- Removing Mixed Pentanes Direct Transfers performed between Rail Cars and Marine Vessels from the RMP. This operation is no longer conducted at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal. \n\n\n\n- Updating the Offsite Consequence Analysis worst-case release scenario and the alternate-case release scenarios for regulated toxic and flammable substances handled at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal based on a refined modeling and process analysis completed in November of 2020. Previous Offsite Consequence Analyses were conducted using the less detailed RMP*Comp platform. \n\n\n\n- Updating the facility's Emergency Contact name and information. \n\n\n\n- Updating the maximum on-site inventories for all 4 RMP regulated chemicals, and  \n\n\n\n- Various RMP data element updates based on revisions to Stolthaven Houston's Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOP\") found in the terminal's Local Training Manual (\"LTM\").\n\n\n\n\n\n? 68.155(a):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nStolthaven Houston, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining our processes r"

The received liquid products are stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and are subsequently transferred off-site through one or more of the above-referenced transportation modes.

      "SummaryText": "nk cars with no intermediate product storage, and VAM slops can also be received into the terminal from marine vessels berthed at Stolthaven Houston's docks.  \n\n\n\nIn November of 2017 Stolthaven Houston placed IFR Storage Tank P50-4 in VAM service.  Tank P50-4 has a working capacity of approximately 48,651-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of approximately 15.9-million pounds (2,043,337-gallons).  As a result of the 2017 VAM storage project for Tank P50-4, piping modifications were completed in P-Manifold to connect the marine transfer system for Tank P50-4 into the existing Dock Line 78 already in place for Tank P50-5 and dedicated to VAM service.  A new VAM filter-pot was also installed adjacent to Storage Tank P50-4.  \n\n\n\nNote that the Tank P50-4 VAM storage project did not change the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's worst-case release scenario for VAM, as the maximum quantity of this material held in any one tank did not increase; existing IFR Storage Tank P50-5 continues to have the largest inventory of VAM in storage.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water if-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks in close proximity.  Existing portable water delivery systems also remain available should they be needed in the event of an emergency.  Note that Stolthaven Houston, Inc. has over 11-years experience in the safe storage and handling of VAM. Stolthaven Houston plans to fully automate P-Tank Farm in the coming years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n? 68.155(c):  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
