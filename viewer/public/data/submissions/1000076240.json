The facility is approximately 0.66 miles north of Highway 60 and 4.1 miles west of Highway 57.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of primarily industrial and commercial zones.  The regulated substance onsite is anhydrous ammonia which has a maximum intended inventory of 24,486 pounds.   The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed-loop cycle with no planned or anticipated emissions of ammonia and is used for refrigeration associated with the production and cold storage of dairy products.\r\n\r\nA mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the source, the refrigerant experiences a phase change from liquid to vapor.  On the high side of the system at the Condensers, the refrigerant releases latent heat as it condenses from a vapor back into a liquid.  These types of systems are referred to as having two sides: a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.  The system utilizes the refrigerant as a vehicle to move heat from the temperature-sensitive zone to the atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nThe low side of the refrigeration system typically uses one or more evaporators and/or other heat exchangers (ex: chillers) to remove heat from the space or product to be cooled.  An evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the refrigerant flows.  As the refrigerant absorbs heat from the air / fluid surrounding the evaporator / chiller piping, the refrigerant boils, changing phase from liquid to vapor.  To increase the rate of heat transfer, evaporators use fans, and chillers use pumps to circulate"

      "SummaryText": "the air / liquid across the heat transfer surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe low and high sides of the refrigeration system are separated by the compressors and the expansion valve.  The compressors are the driving force of the system.  They pull refrigerant vapor from the evaporator (low side) at a rate that will maintain the evaporator pressure required for the desired operating temperature.  At the same time, they pressurize the ammonia vapor and discharge it to the condensers.  The ammonia compressors at the WWF Operating Company, LLC facility are screw type machines.\r\n\r\nExpansion valves meter the flow of liquid refrigerant from the high side to the low side by causing a pressure drop across the valve.  These valves are located between the receiver (high side) and the evaporators / heat exchangers (low side).  These valves, coupled with the capacities of the compressor, can help regulate the pressure of the evaporator thereby creating the cooling capabilities of the system.  The high side of the refrigeration system consists of a condenser and a receiver.  Warm refrigerant vapor enters the condenser after it has been pressurized by the compressor.  Evaporative condensers typically use air and water to assist in the removal of heat from the warm high-pressure ammonia vapor as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser.  As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the ammonia vapor inside the pipes, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows by gravity into the receiver.  The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side.  It also serves to hold the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not in operation.  The system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensibles, i.e. air, from the system.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe WWF Operating Company, LLC facility's ammonia refrigeration system has many safety design feature"

The facility also operates in accordance with corporate oversight in the form of a detailed RMP and PSM standard policy that defines and guides facility personnel to ensure the risks of operating the ammonia refrigeration system are minimized.\r\n\r\nThe facility has trained in-house personnel who conduct the visual walkthroughs of the ammonia system on a daily basis and can identify issues with the system.  The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration contractor to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs, which includes 24/7 response.\r\n\r\nSeveral departments within the facility (Maintenance, Utilities, Environmental Health & Safety, Engineering, Management) as well as outside resources (Refrigeration Contractor Representative, and a Risk Management Consultant) comprise the facility's PSM/RMP Committee that meets on a routine basis (typically monthly) to ensure the appropriate and ongoing implementation of the various elements of the programs.  Discussions range from outstanding corrective action items, to planned design changes to the ammonia system, to changes in plant personnel, to reviewing evacuation drill results, etc.  Significant issues that may be identified are brought to plant leadership to ensure appropriate resources are allocated.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system and the design of the associated safety features was in accordance with contemporary codes and standards.
