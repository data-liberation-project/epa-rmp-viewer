      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Ever Green Co-op\n\nEver Green Co-op's policy is to make sure that those who handle NH3 are employees who have been trained in how to properly handle NH3, and maintain the proper safety equipment.  Such as:  (Gloves, Goggles, Gas Masks, Rain Suits, etc.)    Employees that handle NH3 are required to attend an Annual Training Meeting that is performed by an outside Professional experienced in NH3.  The Emergency Responder #'s are displayed in a highly visible area so that customers and employee's can easily spot them.    Some additional safety practices include:  1) Removing key from the ignition and unhooking the nurse tank from the vehicle before filling nurse tanks. This insures no \"drive off\" with hoses hooked up.  2) We have installed Tri Pods on all  load out hoses.  Tri-Pods are NH3 approved couple's that are designed to snap apart when someone pulls away with hoses hooked up.  This eliminates structure damage, broken hoses or pipes in event that someone pulls away when the hoses are still hooked up. We have installed concrete barriers around exposed piping for added protection. Added signage telling owners of Anhydrous Ammonia Nurse tanks the legal requirements for nurse trailers. Some examples: Legible Decals, Paint, Safety valve dates, Hose expiration, etc. \n\nOur Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEver Green Co-op's is a Farmer Owned Cooperative.  Located on a Farm NW of Tower City, ND.  We buy and sell fertilizer, seed, chemical and offer custom application of fertilizer and chemical. \nThe regulated kind and quantity of fertilizer we handle consist of:  \n\n     1)  Liquid fertilizer  250 tons \n\n     2)  NH3  2000 tons \n\n     3)  Dry Fertilizer  3800 tons \n\n     4)  Micro Nutrients  200 tons\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nWe have had no accident or accidental releases in the past five years\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nAnnually we send our Tier II reports to our two local Fire"
