As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Leaf River. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP rule (chlorine dioxide ) - see topic 1.3\n \n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) -see topic 1.4\n \n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\n4. A managrment system that delineates responsibiitty for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Plan\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one compone"

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and any injuries and damage that could occur.\n\nGP/Leaf River minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nGP/Leaf River limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at GP/Leaf River consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGP/Leaf River is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and "

As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide for the use of bleaching pulp. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3. The threshold quantity for Chlorine Dioxide is approximately 414,000 gallons at a 10-gram per liter (1% in solution) strength during peak operations.\n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1.3    Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nGP/Leaf River performed an off site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment. The off site consequence analysis consists of evaluating a worst-case release scenarios and alternative release case scenarios.

The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Leaf River Pulp Operations. These requirements include:\n\n - one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing     chlorine dioxide)\n - one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n                                                                                                                                                                      \nThe following information summarizes the off site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Leaf River Pulp Operations.\n  \n 1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process- Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\n\n The worst-case release scenario for the chlorine dioxide system is the rupture of one ClO2 Storage Tank. The  ClO2 storage tank contains 207,000 gallons of a weak Chlorine Dioxide solution( 1.0 % by weight).

The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration is approximately 25 miles. The United States Census indicates that 103,000 people live within this distance from the storage tanks; several public receptors are also located within this distance (hospitals, county jails, colleges, several public and private schools, several nursing homes, several churches, several recreation parks, shopping malls and numerous subdivisions).

Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well.
