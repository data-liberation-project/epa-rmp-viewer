The basic technology involves the re-circulation of ammonia, with a change in state from liquid to a liquid/gas mixture, then back to a liquid.  \n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Facility in its liquid state and is stored in a high-pressure receiver.  From the high pressure receiver, the liquid ammonia is moved by pressure to a re-circulator or accumulator (different terminology indicating the same vessel, depending on the age of the vessel).  Liquid is pumped from the re-circulator or moved by pressure from the accumulator to the individual pieces of cooling equipment, which include chillers and air handlers serving production rooms, coolers, product storage tanks, and the like.  As the liquid pulls heat from the surroundings it begins to evaporate.  Since evaporation (as well as condensation) occurs at constant temperature, the result is a warm, low-pressure vapor where the liquid ammonia absorbs heat and changes to a vapor or liquid vapor mix.  The warmed, lower pressure, vapor or liquid vapor mix returns to the re-circulator or accumulator where liquid and vapor is separated and just vapor is then pulled to a bank of compressors.  The compressor compresses the low pressure vapor to a high pressure vapor and is routed to the condensers, which condense the ammonia to a high pressure liquid.  This flow is then returned to the high-pressure receiver previously described.  \n\nTo determine the maximum intended ammonia inventory, a complex calculation must be performed to account for the quantity of ammonia in each of the major process vessels operating at their normal levels.\n\n\n1.3 \tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.  This program is documented in this integrated Plan.  This program meets or exceeds all requirements of applicable PSM/RMP regulations.\n\n\n1.4"

USA (Cutrale) Dade City facility (the Facility) is located at 38000 Cargill Way, Dade City, Pasco County, Florida 33526.  The Facility is a critical part of Cutrale's Florida tank farm operations.  The Facility's main functions include storing and blending juice from oranges.  \n\nCutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of Cutrale and Contractor employees, the public, and the environment.  In addition, Cutrale is committed to operating this and other Cutrale facilities in full compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable OSHA and EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, Cutrale has developed this integrated Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan (the Plan).  Among the important components of this Plan are Cutrale's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the Facility, and Cutrale's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility.  Cutrale has designated its corporate Manager of Environmental Affairs and the Facility's Plant Manager as the individuals with primary responsibility and accountability for seeing that this Plan and its associated components accurately reflect Facility conditions and that it is fully implemented.   \n\n\n1.2 \tSTATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Facility is designed to store juices from citrus fruits.  These products are either sold to offsite packagers for sale to the public or blended onsite or sold directly to a reseller.  To support these primary functions, the Facility operates two ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nThe refrigeration systems are relatively simple systems typical of thos"

      "SummaryText": "FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo accidental ammonia releases resulting in injuries or significant onsite or offsite consequences have occurred in the past five years.                                                                                                     \n\n\n1.5 \tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cutrale Dade City Plant has an emergency action and evacuation plan.  The plan includes instructions for notifying the public authorities in the event of an ammonia release, and for calling in the public HAZMAT responders if needed.                                                                                                                 \nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Plan that defines the sequence of actions to be taken by Facility employees in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  \nIt is Cutrale's policy with regard to emergency response that its personnel are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.  These individuals also are trained to respond to a release by stopping the release, thereby assuming a more aggressive role than those trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  The ERP describes the conditions under which Cutrale personnel would attempt to stop a chemical release, as well as the sequence of actions that would be undertaken under those circumstances.  \n\n\n1.6 \tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis Plan incorporates a number of modifications to Facility procedures designed to improve employee safety awareness, enhance safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia systems, reduce the potential for accidental releases to occur, and increase the speed and effectiveness of the Facility's response should a release occur."
