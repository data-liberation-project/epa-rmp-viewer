It is located 716 Firetower Road east of the City of Jacksonville. The chlorine safety record at the city's old Wastewater Treatment plant site was excellent. This performance has continued at the new facility. There have been no chlorine incidents or accidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) that was completed in 1997 for the Land Treatment Plant has been maintained current for the past five years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program. Key activities have included:\n\no    An annual review of procedures\no    Three Year Refresher training in April 2009\no    A Process Hazards Analysis conducted in April 2009\no    Self Audits every three years\no    A comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program\no    An annual review and update of the Emergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plant maintains a number of systems to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\no    The chlorine delivery system is a vacuum process. This process has proven to greatly reduced chlorine leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\no    A chlorine gas scrubber using a sodium hydroxide solution as the scrubbing agent has been installed. This system will be capable of neutralizing 2,000 pounds of chlorine.\no    Emergency chlorine cylinder cutoff valves activity by the chlorine gas detector. These valves were installed in March 2004.\n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meeting to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\no    Hazard Communications\no    Personal Protective Equipment\no    Lockout/Tagout\no    Site Security\no    Confined Space\n\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an "
