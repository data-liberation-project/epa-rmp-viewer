      "SummaryText": "?The Goal is Zero? is the primary objective of the City of Peoria?s Responsible Care Program.  It requires our employees to achieve and sustain zero recordable incidents at the Greenway plant.  It is a fundamental principle at the City that ALL incidents are preventable and that ?The Goal is Zero? philosophy is truly a responsibility of ALL employees, ALL of the time.\n\nWhile recognizing the difficulty of achieving a completely risk-free work environment, ?The Goal is Zero? has become an integral part of everything that is done at the plant and has equal priority with production and water quality in the day-to-day operations of the Greenway Water Treatment Plant.\n\nAll personnel have the authority and the obligation to shut down any operation and/or stop any work that could result in an unsafe condition.  No operation or work will be started unless it can be performed safely.  Supervisory personnel have the responsibility of directing work in the safest manner possible.\nEach employee has a vested interest in providing for and assisting with the development and implementation of work practices to protect employee health, welfare and the environment.  All employees are responsible and accountable for safety performance including the responsibility to work safely at all times.  If at any time an employee feels that an operation is unsafe or being performed in an unsafe manner, he or she has the responsibility to stop the job and communicate such to the supervisor.   \n\nIn addition, all employees are expected to extend the City of Peoria?s concepts and principles to the surrounding community, distributors, suppliers, contractors and residents.  \n\nOperational excellence at the Greenway Plant can be achieved only by demonstrating continuous improvement in environmental, health and safety performance.  No job is so important, no task is so urgent that employees cannot take the time to assure that it is done in a safe and environmentally sound manner."
