If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Lehigh County LEPC as well as the Lower Macungie Fire Department and Emergency Management Agency, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Lehigh County LEPC, Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team and trained incipient stage fire response on-site to respond to small or the initial stages of an emergency.  The Assistant Operations Manager is the Facility emergency contact and the Administrator of this RMP.  All site personnel are trained in the hazards of this process along with the contiguous butane railcar storage as identified in the employee participation plan.\n\n\n\nThe Macungie Terminal 2BE is a refined petroleum product distributor and wholesaler including propane operations and temporary storage of butane (liquefied under pressure) for use at the adjacent Buckeye Pipe Line Company, LP facility.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the propane storage and distribution system only, including the associated piping, storage vessels, and butane and propane railcars (butane storage for an adjacent facility may occur on the Macungie Terminal 2BE rail spur).\n\n\n\nThe Facility's Worst Case and Alternate release scenarios have been evaluated with subsequent emergency plans being addressed with the local response agencies.\n\n\n\nBuckeye Energy Services, LLC - Macungie Terminal 2BE continues to effort greater interaction with the local First Responders through on-site exercises and training.
