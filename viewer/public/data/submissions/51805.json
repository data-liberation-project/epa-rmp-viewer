This plan is intended to prevent and minimize the impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide inventories exceed the threshold quantities established in the Risk Management Plan Program (RMP) requirements.\n\nThe Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for chlorination and de-chlorination (disinfection) respectfully, of plant effluent.  The use of these chemicals is subject to the provisions of the RMP requirements, due to their A?above-thresholdA? quantities.  \n\n\nPhysical Address:    Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant\n       S 1/2 of SE 1/4 of Section 6,\nTownship 20 North, Range 14 East of I.M., in Tulsa County, State of Oklahoma\n       Latitude:    36A?-14'-20\"N\n            Longitude:    95A?-51'-15\"W\n\n\nMailing Address:    Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant\n       5665 N. 105th E.

The cylinder of chlorine was worked on for 22 hours and 10 minutes by the City of Tulsa Hazmat Team and Brenntag (chemical supplier).  The release was estimated to be 8.4 lbs.  There were no on-site or off-site impacts.  There were no process changes that resulted from the release.  However, retraining on current operation procedures was completed and updates are being made to the Emergency Action Plan.  Meetings were held with the City of Tulsa Hazmat Team and Brenntag about future response planning.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan\nThe purpose of this procedure is to ensure that the Northside Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains up-to-date and complete written emergency action plans (EAPs) and effective response capabilities for all covered processes.  Comprehensive emergency action plans, when combined with emergency response training and drills, can effectively minimize the impact of an accidental release by ensuring proper and quick facility response.  A summary of the requirements as outlined in this section is as follows:\n\n* This facility shall investigate each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release.\n* This investigation shall be initiated promptly, no later than 48 hours following the incident.\n* The guidelines and reports included herein shall be followed for each incident.    \n* All affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings shall review the findings.\n* Investigation summaries shall be retained for five years.\n\n\n\nKey Personnel in Plant Implementation\n\nContact\nPosition\nElement\nPhone Number\nThomas Krueger\nWater Pollution Control Manager\nOverall Responsibility:\nRMProgram Manager\nOffice: 918-596-9845\nHome: 918-227-5310\nShawn Glen\nNorthside Plant Superintendent\nAlternate RMProgram Manager\nOffice:  918-591-4570\nHome:  918-342-3762\nKip Mart"
