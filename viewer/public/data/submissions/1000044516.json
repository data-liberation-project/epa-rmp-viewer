The RMP was prepared in compliance of both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements. This resubmittal includes an updated narrative description (in this Executive Summary) of the AES Alamitos aqueous ammonia accident prevention program, the data elements required by the latest USEPA RMP regulations, and represents a thorough review of operating and maintenance procedures, and a review of the process hazard analyses previously conducted.  \r\n\r\nTwo physical changes to the system were made after the original 1999 submittal: 1) Prior to October 2001, the 7,500 gallon vertical day tank serving the demineralizer system was permanently placed out of service and completely isolated from the Units 5&6 SCR ammonia system (this change was reflected in the November 2002 RMP submittal), and 2) a small ammonia line now feeds a small amount of ammonia (on manual demand) to the boiler feed water system at Units 1&2 and 3&4  replacing the use of 55-gallon drums of 29.4% aqueous ammonia.  As part of the 2004 RMP resubmittal effort, a Hazard and Operability (HazOp) Study was performed on the two system changes.  There were no previously unidentified consequences or prevention program activities/recommendations resulting from this HazOp. \r\n\r\nAs documented in the Offsite Consequence Analysis prepared for the 2001/2002 RMP revision, these modifications at the facility did not result in an increa"

Therefore, in accordance with AES Alamitos' interpretation of USEPA regulations at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68, at 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4), an RMP update filing with the USEPA was not required in 2002 since the OCA impact distance did not change by more than a factor of two. The California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.10 also did not, under that interpretation, require a filing of an updated RMP under the CalARP Program if the OCA impact distance does not change by more than a factor of two unless the process modification is considered \"significant.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to maintain a fully accurate and up to date facility RMP, in November 2002 AES Alamitos filed a final revised version of the RMP with the City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services (Long Beach CUPA). The final 2002 RMP was only filed with CUPA, and not with the USEPA, since an update was determined not to be required under federal regulations. \r\n\r\nAs before, for this 2014 RMP resubmittal, AES Alamitos is preparing and resubmitting the RMP as a single integrated program document which includes all three SCR deNOx systems, and is intended to reset the 5-year resubmittal period to run until June 2019.  \r\n\r\nThe 2014 RMP resubmittal process included the following and no changes to the system have occurred since before the previous resubmittal:\r\n\r\n1.\tAs an inherent part of the December 2013 Triennial RMP Compliance Audit, the SCR systems and programs were reviewed by an experienced multi-disciplinary team of AES Alamitos personnel (operations, environmental, engineering and maintenance), facilitated by a HazOp-experienced ESCI EnviroServices, Inc. licensed Professional Engineer (who completed the Audit).

The AES Alamitos facility has an exceptionally strong safety team and committee program, which are actively and visibly supported by facility management. The facility has in place long-established procedures and policies governing hazardous materials and waste handling, spill prevention, environmental compliance and inspections, as well as safety-related policies.  AES Alamitos has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (such as SCR system awareness and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the aqueous ammonia SCR systems).  Specific to the SCR system, aboveground storage tanks, and the underground storage tank, a multitude of release prevention design, procedural and operational elements and controls are in place and effective.

Currently, the station actively operates six boiler/steam turbine generating units, designated Units 1 through 6. Units I and 2 are rated at 175 MW each, Units 3 and 4 are rated at 320 MW each, and Units 5 and 6 are rated at 480 MW each.\r\n\r\nAs part of any fossil fuel combustion process, a small amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are produced and exhausted to the atmosphere with the other flue gas constituents (mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor). The amount of NOx that the station is allowed to emit is regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).  In 1991 & 1992, revised SCAQMD rules required a reduction in allowed NOx emissions and specifically the facility install a NOx emission reduction system on the two largest boilers - Units 5&6.  In 1993, a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx Control System was installed on Units 5 & 6.  In April 2001, AES Alamitos completed installation of two additional SCR systems within the existing boilers of Units 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The installation was part of a December 2000 agreement with SCAQMD.  \r\n\r\nThe SCR process at Alamitos involves injecting aqueous ammonia into the boiler flue gas in the boiler's convective pass. The ammonia/flue gas mixture flows through a catalyst installed between the convective pass and the air preheater. In the presence of the catalyst, the ammonia and NOx react to form nitrogen and water vapor, which exits out the boiler stack. About 90% of the NOx is removed in this manner. The SCR system uses a 29.4% aqueous ammonia solution in the SCR system. The aqueous ammonia is stored in one 20,000-gallon double walled corrosion protected steel underground storage tank for Units 5&6, and three aboveground 20,000-gallon double-walled aboveground and separately-contained carbon steel aqueous ammonia storage tan"

The results of this OCA, which included worst case and alternative release scenarios, were considered in the implementation of the prevention program and in facility emergency planning.  The results of the facility's Process Hazard Review was used to determine the most likely (e.g. credible) alternative case release scenario based on operations and system design and maintenance.  The specific details and results of the RMP are maintained by the facility and have been reviewed with local emergency response and planning agencies (primarily the Long Beach CUPA).  The administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each scenario are summarized in this RMP submittal.  Details are integrated within the various program implementation documents (such as operating and ammonia loading procedures) maintained at the facility.  The 1999 and 2001 off-site consequence analysis submitted to Long Beach CUPA (worst case and alternative case release scenarios) were evaluated as part of this 2014 resubmittal and found to be still valid and representative, and aside from the presence of the Rosie the Riveter Continuation High School adjacent to the facility front gate, no other change in impact, impacted population or sensitive receptors have been identified.  All data, assumptions and calculations have been verified.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nAES Alamitos SCR systems have had an excellent record of accident prevention since installation.

The ammonia storage system was designed by Southern California Edison.  All equipment was installed by Powerplant Specialists, Inc., under contract to Noell, Inc.  For Units 1 - 4, the SCR design and ammonia storage systems were designed by a consortium made up primarily from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and The Industrial Company (TIC).  The design of the SCR and ammonia storage systems is governed by the California Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Uniform Building Code (UBC), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and California codes.  Installation was governed by the same codes.  The underground piping and tank design and installation were permitted and approved by the City of Long Beach and the Long Beach Fire Department.\r\n\r\nAn ammonia vapor detector system is provided with four ammonia detectors installed above grade on the perimeter of each storage tank facility with additional detectors located around the metering pumps and unloading areas. The detectors are wired to a local ammonia monitor and alarm panel which will also annunciate to control room operators via the plant distributed control system (DCS).   A safety shower is available in each tank area and at the metering pump skids.\r\n\r\nThe control system includes an electronic DCS with Interlocks incorporated which shut off aqueous ammonia flow to the SCR system in case of low boiler load, low gas temperature in the boiler, low SCR fan flue gas flow, boiler fuel t"

The underground containment pipe is compression fitting 4\" PVC schedule 80.  Power Piping Code ANSI B31.1 recommends piping hanger spans of 8 1/2 feet for 1 1/2\" diameter pipe  (water service) at 1g-loads. The corresponding maximum weight stress level from Table 121.5 of the ANSI B31.1 Code, 1989 edition, is 2300 psi. Since the seismic g-load for the subject area is .3g in any horizontal direction, the combined load is only .42g in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the allowable seismic span is estimated to be 200 feet (using (1.0g/0.42g) x 8.5 feet = 20 feet). The seismic span for the aqueous ammonia piping is less than 10 feet in every case. In addition, the pressure stress is negligible since the maximum aqueous ammonia pressure is only 90 psi. Consequently, the seismic design of the aqueous ammonia piping is well within ANSI B31.1 limits.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage tanks are filled via vendor tanker truck deliveries scheduled at regular intervals based upon ammonia consumption.  Truck supply hoses are connected to a loading bulkhead. Transfer pumps, hose purge equipment, and loading controls are provided on the tanker truck itself.  A two-inch fill line and a two-inch vapor return line are routed from the primary vessel through block valves to quick connect type couplings for truck unloading. The fill line allows the transfer of aqueous ammonia from the delivery truck to the tank, while the vapor return line allows the displaced ammonia vapors from the tank to be returned to the truck. The fill and vapor return piping are securely anchored at the truck unloading station.  The unloading station is within the spill containment barrier that runs along the perimeter of the tank.

Aqueous ammonia is stored in three 20,000-gallon, double-walled, aboveground, and separately contained carbon steel ammonia storage tanks. The storage tanks are ASME-registered U-stamped pressure vessels designed for ammonia service. To minimize potential ammonia leakage, the tanks utilize a double-wall design. The inter-wall space is isolated from the main storage space and can be drained independent of the main storage area. The ammonia supply of the boiler SCR units is taken from these storage tanks.\r\n\r\nUnits 1 and 2 utilize one tank (located south of Unit 1) and Units 3 and 4 utilize two tanks (located south of Unit 3).

      "SummaryText": "dent or a similar incident. \r\n\r\nThe investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so reports can be reviewed during future RMPs, PHAs and PHA revalidation.\r\n\r\nAlthough all industrial accidents or injuries are formally investigated as part of the facility's ongoing safety program, specific to the aqueous ammonia handled in the SCR systems and associated storage tanks, AES Alamitos will make additional investigative efforts when investigate incident which would meet, or could have resulted in, an accident  meeting the `RMP reportable 5-year accident criteria' (on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  Should an RMP-reportable accident occur in the future, AES Alamitos will revise the RMP to include information about the accident within six months of the accident's occurrence, and revise the incident investigation information in the RMP.  Specifically, AES Alamitos will revise (1) the date of investigation to reflect the date of the investigation of the accident being included in the five year history; and (2) the expected date of completion of any changes due to that accident investigation, and submit a corrected RMP within six months of the date of the accident.  As stated previously, there have been no accidents meeting this threshold since SCRs have been in use at AES Alamitos.  There have been no recordable accidents of any kind involving the SCR system."
