The facility consists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system.  An additional Blast unit is used to maintain one room at very low temperatures (-30 degrees F). \n\nBoth refrigeration units utilize Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system coolant.  The main refrigeration unit has a maximum capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The blast unit has a maximum capacity of 5,000 pounds.  At this facility, both systems are interconnected.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards.\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive environmental areas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a corrosive irritant to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with skin will freeze the tissue, then produce a caustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered secondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is defined as the concentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse effects.  Howe"

In this case, the toxic endpoint was calculated to be 1.2 miles.  Based on the population density of Orleans Parish (2751.6 persons/sq. mi.), the area within the toxic endpoint radius (4.52 sq. mi.) and the estimated percentage of that area that is residential (50%), an estimated 6,200 people reside within the vulnerable zone.

In this scenario, 3,000 pounds of ammonia is released within 30 minutes.  The toxic endpoint is calculated to be 0.1 miles.
