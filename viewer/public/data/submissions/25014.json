      "SummaryText": "Per Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the final Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program rule on June 20, 1996.  This rule was published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996 and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68).\n\nThis RMP document was prepared for the facility located at 900 Hensley Lane in Wylie, Texas.  Plant documents (plans, maps, etc.) and appropriate facility personnel were consulted in the preparation of this plan.\n\nBased on an analysis of the facility, the toluene diisocyanate (TDI) system used in the coatings and waterproofing production was determined to be the covered process chemical because the quantity of TDI stored at the facility exceeds 10,000 pounds (under federal regulation).\n\nThe facility is subject to Program 1 requirements because the offsite consequence analysis that was performed indicated no offsite impact from the TDI process.  Additionally, there has been no accident with offsite consequences in the past five years (the facility is new).  The hypothetical worst-case accident for the TDI system is a liquid spill during a shipping receipt of a 55-gallon TDI drum and vaporization from the liquid pool that could result in impacts.  Results of the hazard assessment conducted using Complex Hazardous Air Release Model (CHARM?), Version 9.3, conservatively calculates that the furthest distance to the \"toxic endpoint\" of a worst-case spill for TDI remains within the plant boundaries.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone and thus a Program 1 Risk Management Program is required."
