      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program at Dynea, Springfield, Oregon facility, incorporates a Risk Management Plan that assimilates the following elements:\n\n\nHealth, Safety, Environment, and Quality - Corporate Policy\nDynea?s long-term development is secured through the way we handle Health, Safety, Environmental, and Quality matters.  This policy is our basis to build trust between Dynea and our stakeholders.\nWe will:\n- Ensure that health and safety are our first priority.\n- Minimize harmful environmental impacts.\n- Base our work on openness and continuous improvement.\n- Develop products, services, and operations with consistent quality, which are environmentally preferred and safe.\n- Implement this policy according to the agreed health, safety, environment and quality management system based on ISO or equivalent standards.  \n\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activities at Dynea are the manufacture of formaldehyde and the production of specialty resins.  Formaldehyde is produced from the processing of methanol delivered to the plant via rail car.  Aqua ammonia is used in the production of proprietary resins.  The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 52% by weight.  The maximum quantity of stored aqua ammonia is 104,580 lbs, stored in one tank.\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the spill of one of the 50,000-gallon formaldehyde storage tanks due to a ruptured pipe outside the diked area during transfer to one of the resin kettles or the formaldehyde loading/unloading area.  Pumps transfer the formaldehyde solution at a rate of 350 gallons per minute.  During the 10-minute release period specified for water solutions, the quantity spilled would be 3,500 lbs of 52% formaldehyde.  The potential distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for formaldehyde would b"

The potential distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.012 mg/l) is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for aqua ammonia is the rupture of the transfer hose during filling of the on-site tank.  The quantity released would be 140 lbs of 30% ammonia solution.  The potential distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is less than 0.1 miles (or ~170 yards).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Dynea are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM-required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Dynea program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of  Dynea?s PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nDynea has had no accidental releases of ammonia or formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\nDynea has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medic"

Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Dynea to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde and ammonia.  Dynea employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance.  Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and pre-startup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs."
