Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the LEPC, fire department and law enforcement personel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment of our community. \n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of fertilizers to farmers in the area.\n     a.  Anhydrous ammoinis is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n     b.  The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 20,400 in our storage tanks,\n\n3.  Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenario:\n     a.  The worst-case would be the total release of the contents of one storage tank.  The distance to the end point would be approximately 0.9 mile.\n     b.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint would be approximately 0.3 mile.\n\n4.  Acidental Release Prevention Program.  The facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61.1 and 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past fire years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  Our facility is included in the Nemaha County LEPC Hazardous Material Plan.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety;  Safety  is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n\n8.  For further information contact Wilber J. Sherman."
