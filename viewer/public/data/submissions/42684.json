The Facility Policy\n\n    AGChoice and the employees of the AGChoice Ammonia Plant near Weir are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Cherokee Township Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n    The facility has two 12,000 gallon storage tanks which hold approximately 56,078 pounds each by design capacity. The facility also has (13) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and (9) 1,450 gallon nurse tanks for product distribution. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The maximum amount stored onsite at any one time would be 225,061#.\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility is working to implemente the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the Kansas Fertilizer Law.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths or injuries. However there was a release on 5/23/01 that did cause minor property damage onsite and to an adjoining property, but there were no injuries, evacuations or sheltering in place due to the release.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emerge"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n    3/25/05"
