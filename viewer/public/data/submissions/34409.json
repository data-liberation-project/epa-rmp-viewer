This facility complies with the Iowa Department of Ag & Land Stewardship's requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia should occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Preston Fire Department and the Jackson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and environment.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer plant.  We sell fertilizer and pesticides to area farmers.  Anhydrous is used as a form of nitrogen for crop use.  Our storage system consists of two 8,000 gallon tanks with plumbing.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the Iowa Department of Ag & Land Stewardship.\n\nThis facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThis facility has an emergency action plan.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia emergency, it is our policy to notify the Preston Fire Department and the Jackson County LEPC and request they respond to the emergency.  Employees should evacuate the area.  We have discussed this policy with the Preston Fire Department and the department members have inspected our anhydrous system.\n\nSafety is an ongoing effort with the administration and employees working hand and hand to promote safety through training and continued effort to maintain the facility."
