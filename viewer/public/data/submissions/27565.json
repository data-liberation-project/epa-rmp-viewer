      "SummaryText": "The City of La Grande Wastewater Treatment Facility at the wetlands located at 59397 Peach Rd, La Grande. Oregon, is designed to increase process time on a natural filtration system.  The facility will accomodate up to 8000 lbs of chlorine gas, in 1 ton cylinders.  The wastewater is chlorinated then dechlorinated by detention time, and released in to enhanced wetlands for further filtration.\nWorst Scenario is a 2000 lb gas release, that could effect 70 residents, an airport and a wildlife refuge. No schools or hospitals would be impacted.\nAlternative small leak would effect only the wildlife refuge.\nNo accidents have occurred in this facility to date.\nChlorine is stored and used onsite, with a maximum inventory of 4 one ton cylinders.  The PHA was completed using the what-if/checklist method.  Hazards identified include, contamination, corrosion, equipment failure and toxic release. The PHA and a pre-startup review were completed before the process commenced.  The Process controls are in place and maintained on a regular basis.  Mitigation methods include a scrubber, enclosure of the process and a sprinkler system. Monitoring and leak detection systems are in place.\nEmployees participated in the hazard analysis, plan development and the pre-startup review.  Employees also received training in plan contents, operation and maintenance of systems and hazards. Emergency response plan in  place for the facility."
