Active safety systems at the Plant are considered for the alternative release scenario. Average weather conditions at the facility are used for this release scenario, as recommended by EPA regulations.\n\nFailure of a gas pipe in the chlorine feed system is assumed for the chlorine alternative release scenario.  While the toxic endpoint for the chlorine alternative release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the facility boundary, no sensitive environmental receptors designated by EPA are affected by this release scenario.  Public receptors are located within the release area.\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Water Production Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine system and identified action items were completed by December 31, 2002.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are also in place for the Plant.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by facility personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nPlant operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system throu"

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe City of Beaumont Water Production Plant provides treated water to the City and surrounding areas.  Water is disinfected with chlorine in the treatment process and then distributed to residential, commercial, and industrial users. The Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 32,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which is above threshold quantity established by the Environmental Protection Agency and therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Water Treatment Plant since operation began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five-year accident history, as defined in the Risk Management Program regulations, have occurred at the facility.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of a potential accidental release of chlorine at the Water Production Plant were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68.  SLAB Atmospheric Dispersion Model, an EPA-recognized computer modeling program, was used to model a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is a model of a chlorine release under specific conditions established by EPA, including release volume, duration, and weather conditions. Active safety systems in place at the Plant that are designed to minimize the effects of a chlorine release cannot be considered in the worst case scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is required to assume the release in a ten minute period of the entire contents of the largest vessel of the regulated chemical onsite, which for the Plant is a one-ton chlorine container.  Meteorological conditions required by EPA rules are assumed for the release.  The toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is estimated to reach a point beyond the boundary of the facility.

Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\nA team of City personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\n\nPlant personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Beaumont Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
