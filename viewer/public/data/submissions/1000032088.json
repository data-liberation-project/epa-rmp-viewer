We operate under Process Safety Management guidelines, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily control methods and behaviors.\n\n\n\nProtecting the environment and the safety and health of employees and persons on the Company's premises is required by law. But at SABIC, we believe we should do even more as our part of our commitment to the environment, our employees, and persons at our premises and communities. Through management leadership and employee commitment, we must all work together to conduct our operations in a safe manner that minimizes adverse environmental impacts and helps prevent injuries and accidents. We are committed to being a world leader in environmental, health and safety performance.\n\n\n\nWe recognize that to do otherwise would weaken the economic foundation on which our community is built.

Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority everywhere we do business.  This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  \n\n\n\nTo provide top-quality products for our customers, the manufacturing processes at the Mt. Vernon facility use some raw materials that are classified as toxic or flammable. While we strive for 100 percent compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments used to manage and maintain safe operations with these materials, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements.  Our operating practices and procedures, along with our automated control systems, ensure all steps are taken to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade, medical, and chemical emergency response teams staffed with SABIC personnel who have collectively committed thousands of hours to training. Many of these individuals are so committed to emergency response that they serve on their community fire and emergency response departments as well. As a result, they devote much of their personal time to additional drills, training and community response.\n\n\n\nEffective maintenance and implementation of such a contingency plan relies on strong cooperation with the community's emergency response teams. We consistently network with other emergency response providers in our county, as well as those in neighboring counties.  SABIC employees are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the Ohio River Emergency Coop, and the Advisory Liaison Emergency Readiness Team (ALERT) Committee. \n\n\n\n"

Vernon, Indiana.  Construction began in 1960, and the plant has been expanded several times since then.  SABIC currently employs 1,165 people in the Southern Indiana area.  SABIC manufactures engineered plastics, marketed under trade names such as LEXAN(R), ULTEM(R), VALOX(R), and others.  Our products are used in a vast array of applications, including the automotive, medical, electronics, construction, computer, and appliance industries. \n\n\n\nUnlike most plastics manufacturing locations, the Mt. Vernon site houses four separate businesses, including support services and research. The site is the headquarters to three of the SABIC Innovative Plastics US LLC businesses, as well as the Mt. Vernon Technology Department, where more than 110 top scientists and engineers work on the cutting edge of plastics innovation, developing materials and applications for new products and plastics manufacturing processes. \n\n\n\nBoth workplace safety and environmental protection are part of the culture at the SABIC facility, with more than $900 million being invested in the site since 2003 for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection.\n\n\n\nThe Mt. Vernon plant uses five chemicals that are regulated under EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  These are: Mono-methylamine (MMA), a regulated flammable substance; Phosgene, a regulated toxic substance; Chlorine, a regulated toxic substance; Nitric acid (concentration 80% or greater), a regulated toxic substance; and Ammonia (anhydrous), a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\n\nPhosgene, chlorine, MMA, and 80+% nitric acid are r"

Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our manufacturing process.   \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSABIC complies with a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). The programs ensure that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. The programs satisfy the accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP.\n\n\n\nSome of the many, specific safety features in place to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\n\n\nREGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\n\n\n?    Safety procedures that reduce the potential for human error, which could lead to a storage tank overfill;\n\n?    Secondary containment dikes around storage tanks to contain a spill;\n\n?     Scheduled pipe and vessel inspection and testing;\n\n?    Written operating procedures that include emergency response actions;\n\n?    Comprehensive employee and contractor training programs to promote consistent safe work-practices;\n\n?    Maintenance programs to ensure ongoing equipment reliability, including equipment testing and inspection;\n\n?    A safety procedure to review proposed plant modifications before they are implemented for possible hazards -     this is called \"Management of Change\"; \n\n?    Safety pre-qualification for all contractors;\n\n?    Safety reviews prior to startup of our processes; and,\n\n?    Safety permitting procedures that control hazards during special operations such as welding and other maintenance activities.\n\n?    \n\nVOLUNTARY RISK REDUCTION\n\n\n\n?    Computer-controlled safety systems on the phosgene tanks and piping to ensure that any deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected;\n\n?

Vernon site has an outstanding record of accident prevention that demonstrates the commitment to employee and public safety.  Even minor incidents are investigated to identify what went wrong and to learn how to prevent future occurrences.  In keeping with the requirement to report all incidents in the past five years that involved regulated chemicals and resulted in an off-site impact or had a significant on-site impact in this document, we are providing information about an incident that occurred at the plant within the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nOn September 24, 2012, a 3.6-pound phosgene gas release in the Phosgene Operation occurred due to external corrosion of a low-pressure pipe. There was no off-site impact and no one was injured. There was no on-site property damage or injury. Following this incident, SABIC removed the piping from service and implemented enhanced Mechanical Integrity review and documentation procedures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n\n\nThis incident did not involve the Worst Case Scenarios for this chemical processing plant. \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Mt.

Our trained fire brigade, medical, and chemical response teams participate in a mutual aid agreement with emergency response providers within our own and surrounding counties and are active members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee. These affiliations enable us to maintain close working relationships with area hospitals, industries, and other response organizations in the Southern Indiana area.  We've also invested in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site, and staff a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week command center program. We consistently review existing systems and procedures to guarantee the best and most timely emergency response possible.\n\n\n\nFor example, emergency drills, organized and directed by the SABIC emergency teams have included: \n\n\n\n?    A simulated barge incident conducted with local industrial participants and U.S. Coast Guard officials thru the Ohio River Emergency Coop (OREC); \n\n?    A simulated toxic gas site evacuation drill for all employees; \n\n?    A live incident command simulation involving the local EMA and LEPC;\n\n?    Annual site-wide fire and toxic material drills for all personnel; and\n\n?    A weekly test of the SABIC plant-site emergency alarm system.\n\n\n\nOngoing training exercises are important to the company's emergency response organization and help better prepare our partners in the community for emergency response necessary in the unlikely event of a major industrial incident. \n\n\n\nIn March 1985, in partnership with local industry and response organizations, SABIC introduced Advisory Liaison Emergency Readiness Team group (ALERT) siren system in the city of Mt.
