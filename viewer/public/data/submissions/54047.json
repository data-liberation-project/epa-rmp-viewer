This is extremely unlikely since the steel tank is nearly two-inches thick along with the additional safeguards described in the Prevention program.\n\nThe worst of the several alternative release scenarios considered for ammonia is the catastrophic failure of the two-inch transfer line used to fill the ammonia tanks. In order for the reported toxic end point distance to be achieved, the excess flow valves on the ammonia delivery tank and excess flow valves of the ammonia tanks would also need to fail. There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant designed to prevent this from occurring, however, for emergency response planning purposes they were not considered in the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Water Treatment Plant is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the disinfection system.
