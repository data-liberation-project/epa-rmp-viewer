This is extremely unlikely since the steel tank is nearly two-inches thick along with the additional safeguards described in the Prevention program.\n\nThe worst of the several alternative release scenarios considered for ammonia is the catastrophic failure of the two-inch transfer line used to fill the ammonia tanks. In order for the reported toxic end point distance to be achieved, the excess flow valves on the ammonia delivery tank and excess flow valves of the ammonia tanks would also need to fail. There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant designed to prevent this from occurring, however, for emergency response planning purposes they were not considered in the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Water Treatment Plant is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the disinfection system.  The first step in the prev"

Additional steps include:  \n  -  Ensuring process safety information on the disinfection system is accurate, complete and up-to-date; \n  -  Ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; \n  -  Ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; \n  -  Ensuring Plant employee are adequately trained and tested in the RMP program elements; \n  -  Ensuring new equipment and modifications to the disinfection system are designed, constructed, operated and maintained by following Management of Change, Pre-startup Review and Hot Work Permit Procedures; \n  -  Ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and \n  -  Conducting periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nDuring the previous five years, no RMP chemical injury at the Water Treatment Plant has occurred.  \n\nThe emergency response program: \n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is included in the City of Richmond Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) emergency response plan.  In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan than includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm system; emergency responders; training and drills; and pre-emergency coordination with th"
