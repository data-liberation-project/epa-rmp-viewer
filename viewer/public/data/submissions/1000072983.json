Homer City Generation LP identifies the key positions within the corporate structure that will provide this support. The Director of the Generating Station and the Environmental Health & Safety Specialist will provide overall guidance and recommendations in support of Process Safety Management Program and Emergency response support personnel.\r\n2.0 PROCESS AND SUBSTANCE SUBJECT TO 40 CFR PART 68\r\nThe Homer City generating station includes three coal-fired electrical generating units with a total capacity of 1,884 megawatts. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system controls oxides of nitrogen (NOx). This NOx reduction provides a substantial benefit to the ambient air quality in terms of reduced ground level ozone concentrations. An integral part of the SCR system is the storage and on-site transfer of anhydrous ammonia used as a reagent that reduces NOx emissions. Anhydrous ammonia is regulated under U.S. EPA's Accident Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68). Because anhydrous ammonia will be present in the SCR process in quantities well in excess of the 10,000 lb. threshold, the SCR process is subject to ARP regulations.\r\nThe Homer City generating station also utilizes relatively small quantities of anhydrous ammonia in the electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to enhance the control of particulate matter. The ESP process is capable of being supplied anhydrous ammonia from the main anhydrous storage tanks and therefore is subject to the risk management regulation.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas which is readily detectable by its extremely pungent odor. In sufficient concentrations, anhydrous ammonia is an eye, skin, and/or inhalation irritant. For this reason, anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Proc"

      "SummaryText": "he Homer City Generation LP Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\r\nAs defined by 40 CFR Part 68, a worst-case release of a gas liquefied under pressure is a 10-minute ground-level release of the entire tank contents, taking into account passive and administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity. The worst-case release scenario for the Homer City facility is released from the entire contents from one anhydrous ammonia storage tank dispersed under stable meteorological conditions. The possibility of a worst-case type of scenario is extremely remote and virtually prohibited, given the design of the ammonia storage system and inspection and maintenance measures that Homer City Generation LP has taken as part of its ARP. The alternative release considers more typical events and accounts for both passive and active mitigation measures. However, automatic shutoff valves are not considered passive in the present case, and the water deluge system requires Emergency response actions from site personnel, so no credit for these mitigation measures has been taken in the calculation of potential maximum impact areas for the worst case scenarios\r\nIn accordance with revised Risk Management Plan requirements promulgated on April 9, 2004 and in deference to the concerns of the Department of Homeland Security, this executive summary does not include a detailed description of the release scenarios and their consequences. Specific information regarding the off-site hazards assessment for worst-case and alternative releases is included in the RMP Data Elements Report provided to the EPA.\r\n4.0 ACCIDENT PREVENTION\r\nThe processes subject to the Risk Management Regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard with which the Homer City Generation LP facility is in compliance. PSM governs the same processes and regulated substances at the site that are subject to 40 CFR Part 68. Homer City Generation LP has in-place specific operational programs to address PSM/RMP Prevent"

Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the site via tank truck and stored above-ground in three horizontally oriented cylindrical pressure vessels, with a combined storage capacity of 633,600 lbs (each filled to a maximum 82% of vessel volume). Shipping and transfer of ammonia to the pressure vessels is carried out by trained qualified personnel provided by the vendor, using standard operating procedures that have been thoroughly reviewed for safety. The unloading process is monitored from the boiler control rooms and plant security facility via video cameras. The procedures minimize routine release of residual ammonia in the transfer hose by purging ammonia from the transfer hose back into the transport trailer. Ammonia is pumped from the storage area to the SCR area where it is vaporized, mixed with heated air and injected into the flue gas, which is then immediately passed through a catalyst material. The reaction in the presence of the catalyst reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) mixture to nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).\r\nThe U.S. EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three program levels of requirements for industrial processes. Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the RMPlan submittal date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facilities, hospitals). Given that the SCR process contains substantial quantities of ammonia that if released could affect public receptors, it does not qualify for Program 1. Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.\r\nProgram 3 applies to processes, s"

Because the accident prevention elements of Program 3 are virtually identical to PSM, compliance with U.S. EPA Risk Management regulations also constitutes compliance with PSM.\r\nRMP*eSubmit\r\nGARY CLINE\r\nPage 17\r\nEPA FACILITY ID: 100000172733\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n09/24/2018\r\nHomer City Generating Station\r\nCurrent\r\n3.0 OFF-SITE HAZARDS ASSESSMENT\r\nFor the purposes of developing and maintaining adequate RMPlans, the U.S. EPA has defined in its governing rules and guidance a series of modeling methods and assumptions which are to be utilized as administrative guides for planning purposes. In order to standardize and simplify to a practical level the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that would diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-case defined by the U.S. EPA methods and an alternative case, which is considered by Homer City Generation LP to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility, are presented and described.\r\nAs noted, the Homer City Generation Station has used anhydrous ammonia in the ESPs since 1998. No accidental release of ammonia has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, Emergency response, or damage to property or the environment. To ensure that mitigation measures and Emergency response plans are appropriate, potential release scenarios are considered. Thus, the sections of the RMPlan which discuss both the worst-case and the alternative case, believed to be somewhat more probable, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety provided by the programs which constitute t"
