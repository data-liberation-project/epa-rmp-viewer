Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels. Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal are the propane/propylene mixed product that is offloaded from rail cars.\n\nThe Rail Terminal Operations process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specific"

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal located in Chambers County, Texas at 9853 Highway 146 North, Baytown, TX 77520.  \n\nEnterprise's Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal is used to receive a Propane/Propylene mixture (P/P mix) in rail cars and to transfer this mixture via pipeline to Enterprise's Propylene Splitter III. The Propane/Propylene mixture is received via rail tank cars. The mixture is unloaded from the tank cars into one of two mixture surge tank which serve as a feed liquid supply to pipeline pumps and a transfer pipeline which ship the offloaded mixture to a fractionation unit that separates the Propane from the Propylene via distillation. Currently, there are no toxic substances used, manufactured, or stored at the South Rail Terminal that meet the R"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Fire fighting system including fire water storage tank, diesel driven fire water pumps, and fixed fire monitors.\n* Hand-held and wheeled cart fire extinguishers\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.

      "SummaryText": "eria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Enterprise South Rail Terminal is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu group, which includes the Mont Belvieu police, fire department, and Emergency Medical Service, as well as the Chambers County Emergency Management System (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Enterprise South Rail Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Mont Belvieu South Rail Terminal.\n\n* No changes are planned."
