The RMP rule is divided into three programs, based on off-site chemical impacts of neighboring schools, residential areas, and other structures of public occupation.  Programs 1 and 2 apply to facilities that pose no or limited risk to the off-site receptors while Program 3 requires additional requirements to effectively monitor and create response controls.  Triggers for these programs exist based on risk, population density, SIC code, five-year accident history, PSM applicability, and if the facility exceeds threshold quantities of listed chemicals.  Facilities that maintain inventories of regulated chemicals in excess of threshold quantities, as defined in 40 CFR 68.130, are required to develop a RMP and submit registration information to the USEPA, and to coordinate with state and local emergency response and planning agencies.\n\nKinder Morgan Delta Terminal Services operates a bulk liquid storage terminal in Harvey, Louisiana.  Delta Terminal Services stores a variety of chemicals ranging from vegetable oils to volatile organic substances.  \n\nThis facility is regulated under the Program 2 rule requirements of 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n\nIt maintains storage inventories of Toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate (TDI), a listed toxic chemical, in excess of 10,000 lbs as defined by 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G\n\nA release from the Kinder Morgan Delta Terminal could impact off-site receptors (i.e., residences and business areas)\n\nIt does not ope"
