The facility is located in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey and is intended as a transloading facility for propane and butane from rail cars into tank trucks.  The facility is also capable of loading rail cars from tank trucks at the location, but that is unlikely.  All of the equipment at the facility is constructed and operated in conformance with NFPA 58.  \n\n   Stationary Source Identification:\n\nKiros has identified the transloading of propane and butane as the only stationary source at the facility.  The rail cars, tank trucks and transloader comply with the requirements of ISO/IMDG/49 CFR/ASME and NFPA 58.  All containers and equipment meet the applicable US Department of Transportation requirements for safe transportation by truck and the Agreements Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Rail and Road. \n\nThe failure rates of various components of the system have been studied by the European Union's Health and Safety Executive.  The RMP and associated Process Hazard Analysis with Risk Assessment has utilized those documented failure rates in the assessment.\n\n   Emergency Response:\n\nIn the event of the release, Kiros and/or C3 Logistics will follow the onsite emergency response protocols.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local fire department and the LEPC.\n\n    5 Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no releases of Extraordinarily Hazardous Substances from the facility in the last five years.\n\n   Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Procedures:\n\nKiros has developed and implemented Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and a Risk Management Plan in accordance with NJAC 7:31 and 40 CFR 68.  In addition, the facility conducts regular visual inspections and gas monitors are in place to determine the presence of a leak.\n\n   Plan Changes to"
