      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nSystem Overview\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has a capacity of 15,533 lbs. of ammonia which is used to provide refrigeration for a Northfield Spiral Freezer, Freezer warehouse (10,000 sq. ft.) and process air conditioning. The ammonia refrigeration equipment is housed in a concrete block building addition.  This includes Frick compressors, intercooler, accumulator vessel, holding vessel, auto purging system, water pumps for roof top cooling tower and Stellar control system. The Stellar designed control system includes provisions via software and redundant safety devices, including relief valves, check valves automated valves and manual values. Ammonia sensors are located in the refrigeration engine room and throughout the production area and freezer warehouse.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Arnie's Bakery, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Nebraska City Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the production, storage and shipping of frozen  bakery goods.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 15,533 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release "

      "SummaryText": "Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia used as a refrigerant.  The scenario involves the release of 15,533 pounds of ammonia from a liquid spill evaporating to a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.50 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from a relief valve in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 600 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.10 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nArnie's Bakery maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating paramet"
