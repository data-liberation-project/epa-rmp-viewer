              "Description": "Ammonia gas is condensed in the three evaporative condensers and the ammonia liquid drains to the thermosyphon receiver.  A small amount of the liquid is fed from the thermosyphon receiver to the oil coolers on the screw compressors.  The ammonia gas produced from cooling the oil in the screw compressor is returned to the inlet of the condenser.  The major part of the condensed liquid flows to the high pressure receiver.  The liquid is fed from the high pressure receiver to the +5?F intercooler.\nLiquid from the +5?F intercooler is mechanically pumped to the evaporators in the production areas.  Liquid from the +5?F intercooler is fed to the -50?F vertical pump recirculator.  Excess overfed liquid with the ammonia gas is returned through the wet suction lines to the pump recirculator.  The excess liquid is recirculated to the evaporators by the mechanical pumps. \nLiquid in the -50?F vertical pump recirculator is mechanically pumped to the coils in the spiral and storage freezers.  The evaporators are fed more liquid that can be evaporated.  Excess overfed liquid with the refrigerant gas is returned through the wet suction lines to the pump recirculator.  Suction gas from the -50?F vertical recirculator flows to the booster screw compressors.  The discharge gas from the booster compressors is sent to the intercooler where the gas is desuperheated.  The dry suction gas from the +5?F intercooler flows to the high stage compressors.  The discharge gas from the high stage compressors enters the evaporative condensers where the gas is condensed to a liquid and repeats the cycle.\nThe compressor discharge hot gas is used to defrost the evaporators.  During defrost, the hot gas refrigerant gives up heat and condenses.  With the fans shut down, the ability of the coil to transfer that heat to the air is severely limited.  Thus, the metal in the coil absorbs the heat from the hot gas.  As the metal absorbs heat, its temperature rises.  Once the surface temperature is high enough, any ice and/or frost on the coil surface melts and drains off.  Defrosting the evaporators occurs automatically by the microprocessor based control system.",

The ammonia refrigeration equipment is housed in a concrete block building addition.  This includes Frick compressors, intercooler, accumulator vessel, holding vessel, auto purging system, water pumps for roof top cooling tower and Stellar control system. The Stellar designed control system includes provisions via software and redundant safety devices, including relief valves, check valves automated valves and manual values. Ammonia sensors are located in the refrigeration engine room and throughout the production area and freezer warehouse.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Arnie's Bakery, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Nebraska City Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the production, storage and shipping of frozen  bakery goods.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 15,533 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release "

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia used as a refrigerant.  The scenario involves the release of 15,533 pounds of ammonia from a liquid spill evaporating to a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.50 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from a relief valve in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 600 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.10 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.
