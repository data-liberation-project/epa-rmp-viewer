There is Chlorine detection equipment located in both the chlorine storage area as well as in the chlorine feed room.  This equipment sounds an alarm when ever chlorine is detected.  This alarm emitts a loud sound as well as setting off flashing lights.  Also a part of our safety procedures, the plant has on hand emergency repair equipment in case of a leak in a storage vessel as well as  Self-contained-breathing equipment.  All plant operators as well as others who work at the site have been trained in the proper use of all safety equipment.\n\nIn the past five (5) years there have been no releases of chlorine from this facility.\n\nThe Barbourville Water Treatment Plant is covered under Knox County's Disaster plan.  The Barbourville Utility Commission as well as the City of Barbourville cooperate fully with the county's DES coordinator in preparing and updating the disaster plan.\n\nSafety training is conducted on a monthly basis, all related employees must attend these meetings.\n\nThe Barbourville Water Treatment Plant treats 1.5 million gallons of water per day for the community of Barbourville as well as for nearly half of the population of Knox County Kentucky.  The clorine is used as a disenfection agent in the final steps of the treatment process.  Clorine is stored in one (1) ton cylinders on site with a maximum quanity stored  of 2200 lbs.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for this facility would include the following:\n**     2000 lb Chlorine cylinder\n**     Release of 200 lbs/minute\n**     Maximum release time of 10 minutes  \n\nWith this scenario, the end point of the release would be 3.00 miles.  In this 3 mile radius there is a estimated population of 8,500.  However due to the geographic location of the Water Plant the actual number of peo"
