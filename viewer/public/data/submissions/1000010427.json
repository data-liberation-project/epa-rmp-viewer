The mixture is used as a propellant in the filling of aerosol paint cans. \n\nThe propellant is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure and is stored in a 12,000 gallon storage tank at a nominal pressure of 85 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) at 70 F.  Due to administrative controls in place at the facility, including written loading procedures, the tank is never filled more than 80% capacity for a maximum on-site quantity of 42,274 pounds.  \n\nThe propellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is not inherently toxic.\n\n1.2 PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n The Testor propellant filling system consists of the single storage tank, piping from the storage tank to a small propellant fill building, and an aerosol can filling machine.  A Corken centrifugal transfer pump is used to transfer the propellant from the storage tank into the propellant fill building.  The filling machine regulates the incoming pressure of the propellant and injects the propellant into 3-ounce aerosol cans. All of the above-described components and interconnecting piping compose a closed system with minimal possibility for a large release.\n \n The propellant filling system is protected by specific safety systems and hardware which include safety relief valves, excess flow control valves, and safety interlocks and alarms. Safety relief valves protect the storage tank, the tank fill and return lines, and the piping to the propellant filling"

Gas detectors and alarms within the filling room monitor the ambient air to ensure proper operation of the system.  Detected concentrations of propellant within the propellant fill building will actuate exhaust equipment within the fill building and, if levels continue to rise, shut down the process.\n\n\n2.0 POTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe propellant filling system is a closed system.  Historical releases of propane have included only small volumes primarily inside the propellant fill house from the filling machine.  While these incidents can impact employees, they have not historically lead to a release that would result in a potential off-site impact.\n\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined release scenarios, a worst case release and an alternative release, were analyzed to determine the maximum distance to predetermined endpoints.  The release scenarios analyzed and the endpoints evaluated are based on the guidance contained in the USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (the \"Propane Guidance\"), dated October 1998, and the USEPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (\"OCAG\"), dated April 1999.\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the Testor Buckbee Street facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or death, injury, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage off site.\n\n\n4.0 PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTestor has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of propellant, such as the aforementioned occurrences of the worst-case and alternative-release scenarios.  To help minimize the probability and severity of a propellant release, a prevention program that satisfies the OSHA PSM of High"

      "SummaryText": "ly Hazardous Chemicals standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented at the Buckbee Street facility.  The major objective of this prevention program is to implement a management system that prevents releases of propellant, especially in situations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  The program employs a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process including process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness and procedures, training programs, and other interrelated elements that effect the propellant system.\n\nThe key components of the prevention program are based on the PSM Standard and are summarized below:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Process safety information regarding the propellant system has been developed, documented, and made available to facility operators.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the propellant system.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7  A formal process hazard analysis (PHA) is performed on 5-year intervals. A \"What-if\u00c2\u00bf\" creative brainstorming approach is used.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluates the existing system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the propellant system.  The PHA addresses: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA leads to procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the system\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the propellant system. The SOPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency s"

This program includes: (1) routine system inspections to identify unusual or increasing vibration, incipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or failures; (2) replacement or testing of pressure relief valves on the storage tank every 10 years; and (3) periodic testing of gauges, monitoring devices, and safety interlocks.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e. spark or flame producing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), the work must be approved by executing a written hot work permit to verify precautions have been implemented to prevent fire.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the propellant system are \"pre-qualified\" based on their knowledge of propane and/or butane systems and their demonstrated ability to work safely. \n\n\u00c2\u00b7 All incidents that cause or might have caused an accidental or unexpected release of propellant are subject to a formal investigation.\n\n\u00c2\u00b7 Compliance audits of the prevention program are completed to verify that the appropriate management systems are in place and are being properly implemented.\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Testor Buckbee Street facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, including incidents related to a release of propellant.\n\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for plant employees, coordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel in the facility.
