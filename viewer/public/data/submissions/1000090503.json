To fulfill these goals, we enroll in regulatory management service that assists in the maintaining and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs, procedures and training courses. We perform a thorough annual audit program and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards and overseen assistance with this specialty firm. The program consists of internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal, state and local regulations are covered. These checklists are used to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcedures require a timely response and correction of all recommendations resulting from these audit checklists.\r\n\r\nA Site Safety Coordinator is identified and used as an extension of the General Manager and management service personnel.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with this Risk Management Program. We sell Anhydrous Ammonia to growers in nurse tanks manufactured to the requirements to do such. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a needed source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops. Ammonia is also used for blending into mixed grade liquid fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\r\n\r\nOur facility maintains twenty five - 1450 gallon nurse tanks, and twenty five - double 1000 gallon nurse tanks. Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 402,253 pounds. Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in 3 stationary tanks: two 30,000 gallon tank and one - 26,000 gallon tanks onsite. 401,087 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks. Therefore, the total facility Anhydrous Ammonia storage capacity for this location is 413,912 pounds. The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 279,828 pounds.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE SENARIO\r\n\r\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of all of the stationary storage tanks, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 37,600 pounds per minute. According to RMP*Comp modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have offsite impact. \r\n\r\nAnother worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of one of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), released as a liquid over 10 minutes, resulting\r\nin total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 3,000 pounds per minute. According to RMP*Comp modeling, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have offsite"

The alternate release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a three - minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a hose failure requiring a manual shutdown. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 3,000 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint would have an impact on the surrounding area within 1.0 miles. Depending on wind direction, speed, and response time. this could have immediate effects on the residential and industrial businesses of Fairfax. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that our company has never had a total release of an entire storage tank.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 standards (1989 Edition), OSHA - 29 CFR 1910.111, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves. Load out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia it a line or hose would fail. All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use. Lighting for the facility has been increased to discourage the increase of meth theft.\r\n\r\nOur anhydrous ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.
