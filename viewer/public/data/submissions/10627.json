If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Maryville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDENSO Manufacturing Tennessee, Inc. is a manufacturer of automotive components and stores propane on-site for emergency or stand-by purposes.  Four (4) 110,000 gallon tanks are used to store propane.  \n\nThe worst case scenerio would be to lose one (1) 110,000 gallon propane tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to our endpoint.  Our alternative release scenerio is a misfire of the cracker leading to a one (1) minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint does not extend off-site.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the City of Maryville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\nPresently, there are no changes required to improve safety."
