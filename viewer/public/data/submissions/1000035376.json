      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities that process more than a threshold quantity of certain listed hazardous substances to develop and implement a risk management program, and to submit a summary of their risk management program to the EPA. The facility is covered by the rule because it uses anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory threshold. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity. Although methane, contained in the biogas from wastewater treatment, is also a listed hazardous substance it is exempt from the rule because it is burned on-site for fuel. Initially, the summary document, called the Risk Management Plan (RMP), had to be submitted to the EPA by June 21, 1999.\r\n\r\nThe facility is submitting an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the regulatory requirement to fully update the RMP at least once every five years. The most recent full update was March 23, 2015; therefore, this five-year update is due no later than March 23, 2020. The purpose of this project was to prepare the RMP update for the Friona facility.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on the high-side accumulator. The high-side accumulator is the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration process, and contains more anhydrous ammonia than other vessels in the process. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumes that 49,000 pounds of ammonia are released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's general guidance document for risk management programs, and confirmed by EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp. The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 4.0 miles. It was further determined that within 4.0 miles of the facility there is a population of approximately 1,300 people. The public rec"

      "SummaryText": "eptors identified within 4.0 miles of the facility are residences, recreational areas, commercial/industrial areas, and a school. There were no environmental receptors identified within 4.0 miles of the facility.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario examined a catastrophic release of ammonia from a failure of the high-side receiver. For the alternative release scenario, it was assumed that the vessel contained ammonia at its normal operating level. No passive mitigation systems were considered. The distance to endpoint for this scenario was determined to be 0.8 miles. There is no residential population within the calculated distance to endpoint. There were also no other public or environmental receptors identified within 0.8 miles of the facility.\r\n\r\nIn the past five years there have been no accidents involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nThe updated report includes updated prevention program review dates and other activities associated with the prevention program."
