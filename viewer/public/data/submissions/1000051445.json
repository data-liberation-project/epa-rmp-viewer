This is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if an incidental release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond. Should an emergency occur, our policy is to notify the Canadian Fire Department and request they respond and plant personnel are prepared to work with the fire department, LEPC and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Antelope Hills gas plant, located near Canadian, Texas, operates processes to extract petroleum products (i.e. natural gas liquids (NGL)) from field natural gas. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including the regulated flammables ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes. The NGL product is shipped from the plant by pipeline. There is no threshold quantity of 112(r) regulated toxic substances at this facility. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis gas plant complies with applicable rules and regulations.  In the design, construction, equipment specification and installation applicable ANSI, ASME, ASTM, API and NFPA codes and standards were consulted.  The processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, therefore this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant encourages employees to pa"
