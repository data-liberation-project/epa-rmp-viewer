All completed notification forms are maintained.\n\t\nCCCHSD performs a triennial audit of the RMP/CalARP programs, as well as periodic unannounced inspections of all areas in their jurisdiction (including RMP/CalARP) as the local CUPA. The Fire Department conducts annual inspections of Shell\u0092s processes. Shell has discussed the details of hazardous materials maintained onsite and mitigating measures available with CCCHSD personnel and the Contra Costa County Fire Department. The emergency response program is reviewed annually to ensure it remains accurate and current.  Emergency Response Team Members are trained at least annually to maintain their HAZWOPER Level 3 certification.  First Responder Operations employees are trained annually to maintain their certification. Employees are trained on the emergency response program when initially hired, after changes to the emergency response plan, and when employees\u0092 responsibilities are changed. Facility personnel are trained on safety issues and appropriate material handling procedures. \n\t\n****PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\t\nAlthough facilities with Program Level 1 processes are not required to develop additional safety measures to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases, Shell is continually evaluating potential improvements to worker safety that could minimize a potential release of a hazardous material. Recommendations for improvement routinely come from safety meetings, equipment inspections, technology improvements and employee suggestions. There are no current planned changes to the aqueous ammonia system and Table 1 incorporates all the changes that have been implemented from previous plans."

Although not required under Program Level 1 of the CalARP regulations, Shell has voluntarily adopted many of the procedural requirements required for a Level 3 facility. These procedural requirements are highlighted under Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Shell. \n\t\n****THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\t\nShell\u0092s emergency response program was developed to comply with Title 19 of California Code of Regulations (T19 CCR\u00a72731, AB2185 Business Plan) and emergency action plan requirements under Title 8 of California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR\u00a73220, HAZWOPER standard). Shell has coordinated emergency response plans with local officials and satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.4(c)(3) of the CalARP regulation. \n\t\nShell has developed the emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of hazardous compounds to employees. Computer dispersion modeling, along with using the EPA\u0092s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document, has demonstrated that worst-case releases of aqueous ammonia would not impact any public receptor.  \n\t\nIn 2015, Shell created an on-site, fully functional employee staffed Hazardous Material Emergency Response Team (ERT).

It occurred on May 7, 2020. A truck tanker offloading hose had a small minor leak at the truck during filling of the main tank. Rather than stopping the offloading, the driver tried fix the leak by adjusting the cam locks while still actively pumping material to the tank. This made the leak worse and was detected by the operator, who noticed a slight ammonia smell during routine rounds.  The operator immediate stopped the offload. The driver was not exposed or hurt, but it resulted in a release of 30 gallons of 29% ammonia solution into the offloading bay and secondary containment. The hose connection was repaired prior to restarting the offload. The event was reviewed with the delivery company, but ultimately resulted in no changes to any procedures, since the driver did not follow both the plant\u0092s and his own company\u0092s offloading procedures. Consequence management for the driver was performed by the delivery company.  \n\t\nThis five-year accident history review satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation. The purpose of conducting an accidental release review is to promote an informed community while also documenting accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence. \n\t\nShell has established procedures to investigate accidents and recommend changes to operations to minimize the likelihood that a similar acc"
