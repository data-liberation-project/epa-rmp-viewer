Facility Identification\r\n\r\nThe Carl Buddig and Company facility is located at 2125 Rochester Dr. in Montgomery, Illinois. The facility is a producer of custom and specialty meat products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311612. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve meat and meat products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating meat and meat products. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the east refrigeration system is approximately 25,000 pounds. The east refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, and the office area. This system is a single stage system with five (5) high stage compressors. Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the west refrigeration system is approximately 0 pounds. The west refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms and holding coolers. It is a single stage system with three (3) high stage compressors. Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite, considering the quantities in the east ammonia refrigeration system and the west ammonia refrigeration, is approximately 25,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. However, as discussed through out this document Carl Buddig and Company is actively working on improving this program. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The most recent audit of the PSM program was conducted on March 12, 2015, and the next audit will occur before March 12, 2018, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years. The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation. In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Carl Buddig and Company maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Carl Buddig and Company has updated a site-specific PHA program that ensu"

The current HAZWOPER training includes the first responder awareness level, the first responder operations level, and hazardous materials technician training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facility has two (2) windsocks (north and south parking lots) present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release and evacuation of the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe current Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia is included in Appendix E. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Emergency Communications\r\n\r\nThe telephone numbers of agencies and plant personnel that may be contacted in case of a\r\nn emergency are available onsite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nChemical safety is an important part of Carl Buddig and Company operations. Car"
