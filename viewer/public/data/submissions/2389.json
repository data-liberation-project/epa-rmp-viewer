Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Tri-Ag Fertilizers, Inc., Manteca facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 20696 South Manteca Road, Manteca, California, 95336 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 78,000  pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 78,000  pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.   The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.87 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  Th"

Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n1.  Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n2.  Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\nSection 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.

Specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia process at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs."
