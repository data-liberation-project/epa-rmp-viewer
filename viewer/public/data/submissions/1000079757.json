The RMP conforms to the legal requirements established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The purpose of the RMP is to:\n\n\n\n1, Describe existing safety systems at the Fitchburg Plant designed to protect employees, the community, the environment, and the production facility.\n\n2, Share information with the Fitchburg community about plant operations, including steps taken to minimize risk from the handling of regulated substances.\n\n3, Comply with the applicable EPA regulations; 40 CFR Part 68 Section 112(r).\n\n\n\nThe following summary presents an overview of the Fitchburg facility accident prevention and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA SOLUTIONS RESPONSIBLE CARE POLICY:\n\n\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions will operate its facilities and conduct its business activities in a manner that protects the safety and health of its employees, preserves and protects the environment and maintains sound security processes. We are committed to compliance with safety, health, environmental and security laws and regulations as well as those programs we have implemented as part of or Responsible Care values. All OMNOVA Solutions facilities will establish goals, objectives, and processes to drive continual improvement of their safety, health, environmental and security practices. This policy reflects OMNOVA's commitment to its employees, shareholders, customers and communities.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATED PROCESS:\n\n\n\nThe Fitchburg facility produces water-based acrylic emulsions for various industries including textile, construction, caulking, adhesives, floor care and paper industries. The finished products are non-hazardous white latex liquids. OMNOVA Solution's Fitchburg, MA facility processes one material subject to EPA risk managem"

A third party inspection of this tank was last completed in December of 2017 with no deficiencies found. Acrylonitrile is a hydrocarbon raw material used to make acrylate polymers. This manufacturing process, called \"emulsion polymerization\" combines and reacts the acrylonitrile with other materials in water to form a different non-toxic chemical structure, which is sold as a product to customers in various industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to provide information about all accidents involving specified hazardous substances over the past five years. Accidents resulting in (1) death or serious injury as defined by the RMP regulation, or, (2) significant property damage on-site, or, (3) known deaths, injuries , property or environmental damage off-site. \n\n\n\nNo accidents have occurred over the last 5 years at the Fitchburg facility as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\n\n\nIn concert with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard 29CFR 1910.119, the Fitchburg facility has conducted hazard assessments on the acrylic emulsion manufacturing process to evaluate the likelihood and consequences of process upsets and to recommend and install appropriate safeguards. EPA's RMP regulations require additional highly-structured assessments of offsite consequences in the form of a \"Worst-Case Scenario,\" and an \"Alternative Release Scenario\". A scenario is defined as an outline of a hypothed or projected chain of events, which can involve various emission estimating techniques, depending upon the specific circumstances of the release.  For example, the EPA published \"lookup tables\" are used to project the extent of a release of a hazardous substance, but does not account for local conditions like topography.  An alternative to using the lookup tables provided by the RMP regulation is to calculat"

Many models account for subtle but important local conditions that define the profile of a chemical release. Accordingly, OMNOVA Solutions uses EPA-recognized models, RMP Comp, to project offsite consequences for both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is intended to predict the greatest possible severity of a chemical release. When properly used, the EPA-required worst-case hypothesis can be a very useful emergency planning tool, by providing an analysis of offsite conditions and community safeguards. The worst case scenario does not describe overall risk from a process or facility because it lacks the dimension of likelihood. For example the worst case scenario does not recognize the effectiveness of \"active\" safety devices that have been engineered into a process such as containment, sprinkler, or quench systems which can stop or greatly reduce the severity of a chemical release. Furthermore, the unlikely (complete) loss of a vessels structural integrity and instantaneous release of the entire contents is contemplated in the worst case model. As a final note, it should also be recognized that for a toxic worst case, the impacted area is extrapolated to the area of a circle, despite the use of a 1.5 meter-per-second wind speed, which will transport vapors in one general sector from the point of release.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions has also prepared an \"Alternative Release Scenario\" which is intended to represent a more likely description a chemical release scenario from the Fitchburg facility because this exercise attempts to account for both the likelihood and severity of a chemical release, which defines \"risk.\"  Still, while more likely, OMNOVA Solutions believes the alternative scenario is improbable due to engineering and administrative controls at the Fitchburg Plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST CASE & ALT"

      "SummaryText": "ERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP instructions require facilities handling regulated substances to construct one worst-case scenario describing the release of all relevant toxic substances on site. An additional worst case scenario must be prepared if different public \"receptors\" (off site residences, businesses or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material. Since the Fitchburg facility only handles one RMP substance, additional scenarios are not applicable. \n\n\n\nDescriptions of the Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios have been removed from the Executive Summary section of this RMP submittal consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155, as amended April 9, 2004, 69 FR 18819.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions' Fitchburg facility began a formal Process Safety Management Program in 1992 when OSHA promulgated 29 CFR 1910.119.  Process Safety Management in concert with effective engineering design, Employee Safety Programs, American Chemical Council's Responsible Care Program, and Emergency Response Programs make up the Fitchburg\n\nPlant's Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions' overall safety efforts consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous materials, as well as programs to mitigate the effects of a release should it occur.  OMNOVA Solutions has a trained and equipped emergency response team capable of handling foreseeable emergencies.  Coordination with local emergency response agencies is a key element of the emergency response planning process.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility. Continued training and planned drills will sustain and improve emergency response capabilities.   \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nIntrinsic safety is a key element in the design of all process equipment and systems at OMNOVA Solutions' Fitchburg facility.

The RMP scenarios developed for the Fitchburg facility show how significantly the process safety elements contribute to continuously managing risk: having relevant process safety information, review of process and equipment changes before they are made, a review of equipment and preparedness before starting up modified or new equipment (strong Management of Change & Pre-Startup Safety Review process), strong employee participation in process safety, formal process hazard analyses and recommendations, hot work permitting and contractor control, and effective incident investigation.  Additionally, the RMP process focuses on the value of \"intrinsic\" safety design, that is safeguards that do not rely upon physical intervention to work, or \"simple is better\" when it comes to risk reduction.\n\n"
