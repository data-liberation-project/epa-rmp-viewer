This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ConAgra Foods (ConAgra) facility in Quincy, Michigan has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  As part of their release prevention program, the plant has an excellent operator training program and detailed preventative maintenance program.  More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 4.0 of this Executive Summary.\n\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan which is to ensure that the plant is properly prepared and equipped to respond to any emergency including an ammonia release.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing an ammonia release \u00bf Emergency Command Team. The Emergency Action Plan is a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.  The emergency response policies at the ConAgra facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ConAgra Quincy Plant produces processed meats like hot dogs and sausage. The NAICS code for the processes at this facility is 311612.   Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the meat products.  ConAgra has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the products in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia stored in the refrigeration process is documented as 59,872 pounds.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated by the Risk Management Program.\n\n \n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards and the worst-case and alternative release scenario for the regulated chemical.  Though there may be other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each regulated chemical. \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n3.\tEye contact\n\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nConAgra has developed an OSHA (PSM) program for their ammonia refrigeration system. At ConAgra, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, ConAgra\u00bfs ammonia PSM system has been reviewed and the PSM system elements are being implemented for the RMP. \n\nLi"

      "SummaryText": "sted below are the key aspects of the ammonia prevention program:\n\n1.)  Refrigeration operators are trained under a four year apprenticeship program conducted in six month blocks of training.  The formal syllabus includes in-house training and OJT, as well as formal training at local community colleges.  Additionally the plant\u00bfs refrigeration contractor conducts plant specific training.  Upon completion of the apprenticeship program, the trainee is just a few hours short of receiving an associate degree based on the community college courses alone.\n\n2.)  The Quincy plant uses a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for control scheduling and accomplishment of preventative maintenance on components of the refrigeration system.  The scope of preventative maintenance (PM) and testing/inspection (T/I) for refrigeration components is based on individual vendor recommendations and generally accepted engineering practices with regard to types of preventative maintenance and inspections and their recommended frequencies.  Individual work tasks for each type of PM and T/I associated with the refrigeration system are being created.  These tasks are included on the individual work order generated by the CMMS.  This system ensures that each operator/mechanic is aware of the pertinent safety precautions required for a PM procedure as well as the step-by-step actions required to complete the procedure.  The operator/mechanic and their supervisor sign off the completed work order.  Specific results of each PM and T/I procedure are recorded on the work order.  In the event a PM or T/I procedure is not completed satisfactorily, the operator/mechanic notes it on the work order, and a follow-up work order is generated to address the specific deficiency.  Additionally, operator training requirements are input to the CMMS for each operator.  \n\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of ConAgra\u00bfs accident history includes the following range of dates: June 21, 2004 \u00bf Augus"

      "SummaryText": "t 22, 2005.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been two accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ConAgra facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. All emergency response personnel (Emergency Command Team) undergo emergency response training. The Emergency Command Team is responsible for implementing the EAP and controlling all aspects of the plan and personnel.\n\nThis document contains information regarding:  1) emergency contacts; 2) coordination with local authorities; 3) emergency communication protocol; 4) emergency action team job descriptions; 5) emergency notification procedures; 6) emergency evacuation notification procedures; 7) personnel accounting procedures; 8) emergency action team procedures; 9) emergency evacuation/action procedures; 10) incident commander protocol; and 11) training.\n\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items to improve safety was developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished."
