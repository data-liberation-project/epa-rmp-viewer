Maximum release of 535 pounds in an enclosed area with drains for a period of 5 minutes.ARP is based on Processs Safety Management for Chlorine. Daily and weekly inspections of equipment with immediate repairs of found problems. Each employee is trained and must demonstrate both a cognitive and hands on understanding of the chlorine process before allowed to operate as an individual. Chlorine training ocures each year with review of the Emergency Action Plan. There are local alarms and indicators to a faulty system which are monitored 24 hours a day. Management is keenly aware of the need to monitor the system and demands compliance from all employees in this matter.There has been no releases in the past 15 years.Patoka Lake Regional Water and Sewer District  has an Emergency Action Plan which has been reviewed with all local Fire Departments and the Dubois County LEPC. The last visit by the Fire Department was Jan of 2003. The only possible planned change  to the ARP at this time is to not use  two chlorine tanks in line. By limiting  to just one tank it will decrease the exposure  and possibility of a larger release should emergency shut off fail."

Superintendents are held to an extremely high standard and are accountable for their respective areas of  operation. Each employee is empowered to resolve any issue immediatly which could cause a release. If they are not able to fix or repair , outside assisstance is called immediaetly. Stationary source is of chlorine in one ton containers used in the treatment of waste water. There are two locations on site in enclosed areas. They consist of two cylinders being connected to feed the system.    Worst case scenario is offloading a one ton cylinder and causing a crack or rupture. Total release would be 2000 pounds of chlorine . RMP Comp was used with a release time of 10 minutes at a rate of 110 pounds per minute. Wind speed 1.5 m/sec. Toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles. The primary receptor would be Lick Fork recreation area on the Patoka Lake.  A state reccreation area over two miles distance. The forested area between facility and  the marina is mature dense hardwood. The vapor would disperse before reaching this point. Alternative release scenario is a leak in the hose (line) system. This would be identified by alarm system and process shut down with out delay. Employees are trained to respond and repair the leak or call outside repair service if it is outside of their abilities. RMP Comp was used to determie the endpoint of 0.10 miles,effecti"
