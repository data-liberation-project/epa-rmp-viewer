Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Riviera Power Plant (Riviera) is owned by the Florida Power & Light Company.   The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency action plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe FPL Riviera Plant is a power plant that generates electricity.  The plant uses a chlorination process to treat its condenser and auxillary equipment cooling water.  The facility is located at 200-300 Broadway, in Riviera Beach,  Palm Beach County, Florida.  The Riviera Power Plant adds chlorine as a biocide for their cooling water intake from FPL's water supply in order to reduce scale in their condensers and other heat exchangers.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to three one-ton containers at the Chlorination process.  One one-ton container is always connected to the process with two additional containers stored adjacent to the connected container.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 6,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not in an enclosed building.\n\n3. Description of the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is the rupture of a one- ton container from the Chlorination process, releasing 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine gas over a ten minute period.  Under worst case weather conditions, the chlorine gas could travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance lookup tables.\n\nThe Alternative-Case Release Scenario is characterized by a vapor release prior to the vacuum regulator due to pipe failure from worker/human error, external impact, or corrosion.  For the Chlorination process, the "

      "SummaryText": "release rate was determined to be 149.2 lbs/min.  Under normally expected weather conditions, the chlorine gas could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (reaching a concentration less than .0087 mg/L), using the WWTP Guidance.\n\n4. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Riviera Power Plant Chlorination process in the Program 3 level.  The Riviera Power Plant facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe Riviera Power Plant is currently developing a program to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout and Hot Work Permit, have long been required by the Riviera Power Plant Operations Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the collection and review of all equipment information and the development of updated Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all chlorination industry stand"

Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n5. Accident History\n\nThe Florida Power & Light Company Riviera Power Plant facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years that caused any offsite injury or harm as defined in the RMP regulation.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Riviera Power Plant has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The facility will rely on outsite responders to respond to a chlorine accidental release.  The site also has some internal emergency response capability and has a procedure to address small releases of chlorine.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Palm Beach County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519."
