      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nExecutive Summary for MidAmerican Energy Company Greater Des Moines Energy Center Risk Management Plan \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\n\nMidAmerican Energy Company's (MidAmerican) Greater Des Moines Energy Center is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Processes (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nMidAmerican Energy Company's primary activity is the generation of electrical energy by combustion of natural gas in a combined-cycle, combustion turbine facility. \nPart of that activity involves the use of a system that provides aqueous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction in the heat recovery steam generators. The aqueous ammonia storage and forwarding system (the process) consists of a storage tank, two forwarding pumps, associated piping, valves, and instrumentation.  Vaporized ammonia is injected into the SCR section. The flue gas entrains the ammonia and as the mixture passes through the SCR, it undergoes a reaction that reduces nitrogen oxides to meet the standrds within the facility's air permit.\n\nThe maximum inventory of aqueous ammonia in the process is 197,690 pounds. Ammonia in the storage tank is concentrated at 29.4% in water. \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios (40 CFR 68.165(a)(1))\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for the facility, MidAmerican used the EPA-approved ALOHA 5.4.7 for modeling results. The worst-case scenario involved the catastrophic release of aqueous ammonia from the storage tank. In this scenario, all 197,690 pounds of aqueous ammonia is released into the diked enclosure around the sto"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 4.32 meters/second wind speed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is one more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, unless no release occurs. In this scenario, 197,690 pounds of aqueous ammonia is released from the storage tank into the diked enclosure.  No controls were assumed, even though row valves may be utilized in an emergency to mitigate releases. Also, less than 197,690 pounds of aqueous ammonia will be typically present. Under neutral weather conditions (stability Class D) and wind speed of 3 meters/second, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is<0.10 miles. \n\nWe determined that there are public receptors within the worst-case or alternative release scenarios.  There have been no accidents at the Greater Des Moines Energy Center.  \n\nThe process qualifies for Program Level 2. The Greater Des Moines Energy Center responsibility under Program Level 2 is as follows:\n\n* Submit a single RMP, as provided in \u00a768.150 to 68.185. The RMP shall include a registration that reflects all covered processes.\n* Analyze the worst-case release scenario for the process, as provided in \u00a768.25; estimate the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in \u00a768.22(a); and offsite impacts within the radius of the distance to the endpoint; then submit in the RMP the worst-case release scenario as provided in \u00a768.165;\n* Complete the five-year accident history for the process as provided in \u00a768.42 of this part and submit it in the RMP as provided in \u00a768.168;\n* For Program 2 processes, the owner or operator shall submit in the RMP meeting requirements listed in \u00a768.12(c); \n* Provide in the RMP an executive summary as provided in \u00a768.155 that includes a brief description of the following elements: \n       (a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationa"

The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate engineering and nationally recognized design standards. The following sections describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place. \n\nEmergency Response Plan \n\nThe Greater Des Moines Energy Center employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances; therefore, the requirements of \u00a768.95 are not applicable to the Greater Des Moines Energy Center.  The Greater Des Moines Energy Center has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to be included in their emergency response plan.  The Greater Des Moines Energy Center has also coordinated with the local fire department to be included in their fire mitigation plan.\n\nThe Polk County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which emergency response has been coordinated. \n\nThe telephone number of the LEPC Coordinator is (515) 286-2107.\n \nFive-Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidents at the Greater Des Moines Energy Center. \n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia monitors have been installed around the aqueous ammonia storage tank at the Greater Des Moines Energy Center.  Monitors are provided with backup power in the event of a power outage. In the event of an ammonia release, plant operators will receive an alarm from the monitors.  The plant operators will then notify emergency respon"
