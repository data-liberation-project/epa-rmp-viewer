Hillsboro Farmers Cooperative is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.The anhydrous ammonia is stored and distributed to its agricultural customers. The companies agricultural customers use this product as a source of nitorgen primarliy for growing corn.The company receives anhydrous ammonia by transport truck. The maximum amount of ammonia that could be stored at this plant is 92820.00 pounds. The worst case scenario would be the failure of the companies anhydrous ammonia tank. The tank when filled to 85% would release 92820.00.The distance to the end point would be 1.60 miles.The alternate release would be a hose breaking and releasing 2400.00. The release is stopped by human intervention within two minutes.The distance to the end point under these conditons would be .30 miles.\nHillsboro Farmers Cooperative Warehouse has not had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that has resulted in any off site deaths or injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,property or environmental damage.
