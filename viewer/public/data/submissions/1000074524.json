Specific responsibilities are summarized in the supporting documentation associated with this RMP Plan.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThe Harmon Creek Plant resolves findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. Currently, there are no findings to report.\n\nMPLX believes that diligent compliance with our PSM Program forms the framework that allows for the continued improvement to the level of safety at the Harmon Creek Plant.  Some of the key components of the program that will help maintain and, where applicable, improve safety are:\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the Harmon Creek Plant considers the potential safety and health impacts of each change made to chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\nThe PHA provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards. \n\nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous release thereby serving as an integral part to the safety program.\n\nInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the Harmon Creek Plant maintains and increases th"

Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing). \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThis is a new facility. There have been no accidental releases from covered processes in the last five years that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nThe Harmon Creek Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).  The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of company staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs.  However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the Harmon Creek Plant would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical process operations before they evacuate.  The Harmon Creek Plant has around the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Harmon Creek Plant is coordinated with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Harmon Creek P"

In addition, the Harmon Creek Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years. Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe processes at the Harmon Creek Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safely features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities \n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the Harmon Creek Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Harmon Creek Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection \n1. Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel. \n2. Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\nRelease Containment/Control \n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases. \n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated). \n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature) \n4. Curbing or dykes to contain liquid releases. \n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control syst"

      "SummaryText": "MPLX encourages employees to participate in the facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a PHA team. Employees will be provided with the information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility. \n\nHot Work Permit \n\nMPLX uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process. The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed. Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nMPLX has long-standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, Industrial Standards, and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\n\nContractors \n\nThe Harmon Creek Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of the hazards that they find during their work.
