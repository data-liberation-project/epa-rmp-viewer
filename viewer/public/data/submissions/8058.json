The total amount of hydrogen chloride contained in the cylinder storage area at any given time may exceed the applicable RMP rule threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.  At this time, hydrogen chloride is not used in any batch process operation in an amount greater than the applicable threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.  Consequently, the storage area is the only hydrogen chloride process currently subject to regulation under the RMP rule.  \n\nParke-Davis has implemented a number of safety measures to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hydrogen chloride.  These measures include:\n\n1. \n600-pound hydrogen chloride cylinders are stored in a secure, fenced, dedicated area on a concrete pad.  The storage pad is isolated from other manufacturing activities.  Only DOT approved shippers or trained and certified Parke-Davis colleagues are allowed to move and handle hydrogen chloride cylinders.  These precautions help to prevent cylinder mishandling and damage.\n\n2. Hydrogen chloride cylinders are constructed of steel in accordance with DOT regulations for over-the-road transportation. The cylinder valve is capped to protect it from damage during transportation.  Cylinders are mounted and secured onto steel carts prior to transportation into process areas.  All colleagues who use fork trucks to move hydrogen chloride cylinders are trained and licensed by Parke-Davis.\n\n3.

Parke-Davis believes that any phosgene or hydrogen chloride release would have substantially less impact on potential environmental and public receptors than the described alternative scenarios.  Specifically, the phosgene alternative release scenario requires the simultaneous failure of multiple process control and safety systems, and the complete release of reactor contents without any response by chemical operators or the Haz-Mat team to minimize or respond to the release.\n\nPhosgene\n\nPhosgene is used in two processes.  In one process, an initial 440-pound charge of phosgene is made to the reaction mixture.  The reaction undergoes a small temperature increase as the reaction is initiated.  Once initiated, phosgene reacts as it enters the reactor and does not accumulate in an appreciable quantity.  The only potential for any significant phosgene release is during the period of reaction initiation.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes that the full 440-pound phosgene charge is released through the reactor emergency vent as a gas at a temperature of 149 oF and an elevation of 22 feet under typical weather conditions.  Weather conditions assume a 48 oF ambient temperature, 62% relative humidity, 9.1 mile per hour (4.1 meter per second) wind speed, and D atmospheric stability.  A ten-minute release is assumed.  This is consistent with the worst case release period and approximates the time required to vent the reactor contents through a safety relief valve which is assumed to open and close to maintain reactor pressure between relief valve set points.  Please note that Parke-Davis has never experienced a phosgene release such as described in this alternative scenario.  \n\nThe alternative case modeling was conducted using the EPA approved SLAB model for dense gases.

Parke-Davis will significantly reduce its use of the 600-pound cylinders through use of a bulk hydrogen chloride storage and distribution system.  Hydrogen chloride will be stored in six 3,500-pound cylinders supported by a flat bed trailer. The facility will have unloading facilities for three trailers; however, only one cylinder of one trailer will actively supply the facility's bulk hydrogen chloride distribution system at one time.  The second trailer will be in backup status while the third will be in route to and from the supplier.  The use of the bulk system will result in improved plant safety due to the increased use of automated control systems and feed interlocks, reduced transfer pressures, and a significant reduction in the handling and use of the 600-pound cylinders.  The bulk storage and transfer facilities have been installed and are awaiting completion of pre-startup qualification inspections and tests.\n\n2.

Both chemicals require careful storage and handling due to their potential toxic hazards.  A detailed description of the chemical properties, regulated processes, process safety and control features, and the worst-case hazard scenario are provided below.\n\nChemical Properties\n\nPhosgene is a toxic and corrosive liquid with a boiling point of 47 oF.  Phosgene evaporates to form a gas at temperatures above the boiling point.  Exposure may cause severe irritation to the respiratory system, skin and eyes.  Inhalation of high concentrations of phosgene may cause headache, olfactory fatigue, respiratory irritation, difficulty breathing, lung congestion and, under extreme conditions, death.  In addition, symptoms may be delayed for a period of from 24 to 48 hours after exposure.  It is critical that persons exposed to phosgene seek immediate medical attention for prompt treatment.  The threshold quantity for phosgene is 500 pounds under the EPA RMP rules and 100 pounds under the OSHA PSM standard.  \n\nHydrogen chloride is a corrosive gas.  Exposure may cause severe irritation to the respiratory system, skin and eyes.  Inhalation of high concentrations of hydrogen chloride can cause respiratory irritation and corrosive burns, lung congestion, lung damage and, under extreme conditions, death. The threshold quantity for anhydrous hydrogen chloride is 5,000 pounds under both the EPA RMP rules and OSHA PSM standard.  \n \nThe EPA rules define a toxic endpoint for both phosgene and hydrogen chloride by reference to the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2), developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).

The design of the valve boxes and double piped distribution system provides for phosgene containment from the cylinder valve to the reactor.  If a leak occurred, phosgene would be vented to the scrubber system and not released to the environment.\n\n7. Nitrogen, an inert gas, is used to push phosgene from the cylinder through the double walled piping system to the reactor.  Nitrogen is supplied from a dedicated bulk tank.  Bottled nitrogen provides a backup source should the primary nitrogen source fail.  Nitrogen pressure is controlled and process interlocks prevent phosgene from entering the nitrogen supply systems.  Nitrogen is also used to pressure test phosgene piping and reactor systems prior to each phosgene use.\n\n8. A 16-point phosgene monitoring system continuously samples plant and process areas likely to be affected by a phosgene leak.  The system will activate an alarm and automatically stop the phosgene charge.  The monitoring system minimizes any potential leak by automatically closing all phosgene feed control valves when the leak is detected.\n\n9. Phosgene is used in only two reactor vessels. Both reactors are glass lined and meet the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) codes for pressure vessels. Phosgene is charged while the reactor is being vented through the scrubber system to the thermal oxidizer.  Reactors are equipped with high and low-temperature sensors that stop the phosgene charge if unusual process conditions occur.  A high-pressure sensor stops the phosgene charge if reactor pressure exceeds 1 pound per square inch (PSI).

The sump area is also vented to a dedicated scrubber system that would destroy any vaporized material.\n\n5. The phosgene cylinder rests securely within a steel cradle with the cylinder head inserted through a collar into a glove box located in the phosgene charging building.  The operator can remove the bonnet and make process connections to the cylinder only when the cylinder head is inserted into the glove box.  The air inside the glove box is continuously vented to a dedicated phosgene scrubber system.  The scubber destroys the small amount of phosgene that can be released into the glove box when the cylinder is disconnected from process piping. If a leak occurred, phosgene would be vented to the scrubber system and not released to the environment.\n\n6. Liquid phosgene is piped to two reactor vessels through a double walled piping system.  An inner welded steel pipe is contained within an outer glass pipe that is protected from damage by a metal protective guard.  The annular space between the steel and glass pipes is vented to the dedicated phosgene scubber system.   In addition, all phosgene valves are contained wit"
