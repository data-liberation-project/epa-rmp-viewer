This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Hobbs Terminal that are regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline system, propane storage/loading facility and underground cavern storage facility.  The Fractionation facility receives a mixed (Y-Grade) hydrocarbon liquid stream via pipeline and separates these liquids into relatively pure component streams via a freactional distillation plant.

The tank storage facility is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Hobbs Terminal has a multitude of Department of Transportation \u00bf regulated pipelines that are routed through the facility.  These pipelines are mixed natural gas liquid lines (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane), a dedicated ethane/propane liquids line and various other pipelines.  Each of these pipelines have electric driven pumps and gas turbine driven pumps that add horsepower to the product transfer down the pipelines, or the pump system can be bypassed when the pumps are not needed or down for maintenance.  The Hobbs facility can also receive propane from one of the two natural gas liquids pipelines to a single 63,000 gallon capacity storage tank.  This tank can be used for distribution to the four propane truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.  The previously mentioned tank is presently dormant and not in use.  But if service is required the tank level is administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of its capacity.\n\nIn addition, Enterprise has thirteen salt mined caverns for underground storage of hydrocarbons to/from interstate pipeline.  The product for these caverns comes to/from the various pipelines.  The caverns are regulated by the Department of Transportation.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into a single storage tank via the dedicated propane pipeline or the mixed product pipeline.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Hobbs Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Hobbs Terminal.\n\nWorse Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  The entire inventory of the tank is relative to mitigation of the simulation.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.

The simulation calculated that 31,500 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Gains County LEPC Director, which includes the Gains County Sheriff\u00bfs Department, the local Police department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Gains County Sheriff\u00bfs Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from"
