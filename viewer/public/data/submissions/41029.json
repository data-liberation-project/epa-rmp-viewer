The Antioch Natural Gas Liquids Facility is owned by LNGP, LLC and operated by Tellus Operating Group, LLC.  The natural gas liquids are stored in one 30,000 gallon tank containing mixed flammable compounds consisting primarily of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane.  This 30,000 gallon natural gas liquids tank is located inside a remote, 100' x 30' fenced area approximately 1/2 mile from the Antioch Natural Gas Processing Plant and over 1/2 mile from the nearest public receptors.    A truck unloading dock is located outside the fenced area.  Additionally, a second 30,000 gallon natural gas liquids tank is located in the same area and serves as a back-up or reserve tank for these liquids.  This tank is only used during temporary processing equipment maintenance. A dike is installed around the tank for containment of any potential liquids.  Two 1,000 gallon propane tanks are located at the geographically separate Antioch Natural Gas Processing plant for use in the extraction process; however, these 1,000  gallon propane tanks are not co-located with the remote 30,000 gallon mixed flammable tank.    \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at the Antioch Natural Gas Liquids Facility is to adhere to all applicble federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Claiborne Parish Fire District No. 6 and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have coordinated our response plan with the Claiborne Parish Emergency Response Commision and the local fire department; members of the fire department also receive SARA Tier II reports describing hazardous materials handled onsite.  Our Emergency Response Plan has"

      "SummaryText": "been developed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and includes procedures for responding to an accidental release, for emergency health care, and for notifying the public and appropriate agencies.  This facility complies with EPAs Chemical Accident Prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.   \n\nWe have never had an accident involving flammable materials that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  \n\nThe Risk Management Plan includes a worst case release involving a vapor cloud from an explosion of the 30,000 gallon tank which would theoretically result in a release of 120,000 pounds of a flammable mixture.  The endpoint to 1 psi is 0.4 miles as calculated from RMPComp.  The same endpoint is calculated for either flammable mixures or 100% pure propane.  A recent field survey confirms there are no public receptors within this radius.  Based on the lack of any past releases and the absence of any public receptors within the flammable endpoint radius, the facility is subject to Program Level 1 under RMP. Although not  required for Program Level 1, an alternative release scenario was evaluated which indicates an endpoint to the lower flammability limit of <0.1 mile."
