Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe City of Camden Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. Accidental release prevention is a function of the safety devices (technology) inherent in the facility design, safe material handling practices used (procedures), and commitment to training of plant employees (management practices). All applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Prevention Program (40 CFR 68.68-87) are adhered to. It is the goal of the City of Camden Water treatment Plant to ensure plant and community safety through an aggressive program of hazard analysis, preventive maintenance, equipment testing, standard operating procedures, and employee training.\n\nThe City of Camden Water Treatment Plant emergency response policy involves the preparation of an emergency preparedness plan which is tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The emergency preparedness program includes procedures for notification of the City of Camden Fire Department HAZMAT Team (off-site mutual aid response), LEPC (community response plan), and SCDHEC (state response plan). The City of Camden Water Treatment Plant emergency preparedness program is based upon recommendation of the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the Chlorine Institute and is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Emergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.90) requirements.\n\n2.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe regulated substance handled and used at the City of Camden Water Treatment Plant is chlorine. The Maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the facility at anytime is 16,000 pounds (8 ton containers).\n\nThe City of Camden Water Treatment plant provides potable water for residential, retail, and industrial"

      "SummaryText": " use throughout the City of Camden service area. Chlorine is used in the water treatment process to destroy nuisance and pathogenic microorganisms in the water (i.e., chlorine use as a water disinfectant is an industry standard). The chlorination process includes chlorine container handling and storage facilities, chlorine feed system (vacuum chlorinators, piping, and injectors), and related safety equipment and instrumentation. The City of Camden Water treatment Plant is manned 24-hours a day and access to the plant site is restricted to authorized personnel.\n\n3.    Worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst -case release scenario is defined by EPA as the release of the maximum quantity of a regulated substance from a process vessel or pipe line failure that will result in the greatest distance to the designated endpoint. The probability of the release occurring is not considered, it is just assumed to happen. The worst-case chlorine release scenario the the City of Camden Water treatment Plant involves a catastrophic failure of a one ton chlorine container and the predicted release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine to the atmosphere. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed following conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount of chlorine as gas in 10 minutes, chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mb/l (i.e., the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action), And worst-case weather conditions (i.e., stable atmospheric condition s and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s). Also, no administrative of passive mitigation systems were considered in this scenario. The RMP*Comp, Version 2.01, computer model was used to perform this consequence analysis. The results of the consequence"

      "SummaryText": " analysis performed for the hypothetical worst-case chlorine release scenario did predict an offsite impact.\n\nEPA describes the alternative release scenario as simply a more realistic release than the worst-case release or a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release. The alternative release scenario chosen for the City of Camden Water Treatment Plant involves the accidental release of chlorine gas from a damaged connection on the cylinder during unloading. In this case, liquid chlorine is released through a 3/8 inch diameter (0.114 in2) hole resulting from damage to a fusible plug. The hole is positioned 4 inches below the top of the liquid column. The leaking connection continues until the emergency response can be initiated and completed (30 minutes) by trained employees. The result is a release of all 2000 pounds of chlorine to the atmosphere in 30 minutes. The alternative chlorine release scenario chosen for the City of Camden Water Treatment Plant was selected based on the results of a qualitative risk analysis of possible release alternatives. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario incorporated less stable weather condition (i.e., Stability D and wind speed of 3.0 m/s), passive mitigation (i.e., enclosure) and active mitigation (i.e., actuation of chlorine leak detector and emergency response by offsite mutual aid responders to control the leak). The RMP*Comp, Version 2.01, computer model was used to perform this consequence analysis. The results of the consequence analysis performed for the hypothetical worst-case chlorine release scenario did predict an offsite impact.\n\nWhile EPA requires analysis of the consequence of a worst-case release scenario, worst-case scenarios as defined by the EPA have an extremely low probability of occurrence. The worst-case release could only happen if the majority of the safety and technology features in use failed at the same time. Additionally it would have to occur at exactly the time the "

      "SummaryText": "worst-case weather conditions also existed, a most improbable event. Further, certain mandated consequence condition such as the entire amount of chlorine will be released as a gas in ten minutes and comparison of a ten minute release to a toxic endpoint based on a one-hour exposure value are unrealistic. However, there is now allowance in the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule for making an adjustment to the worst-case release scenario conditions. For this reason, the alternative release scenario should be the focus of prevention and preparedness efforts.\n\n4.     General accidental release program and the chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe City of Camden Water Treatment Plant complies with EPA's RMP rule, OSHA's Process safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119), and with all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The chlorination process was constructed, and is operated, in accordance with recommendations of the AWWA and Chlorine Institute. The City of Camden Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n    High level of training for operators and maintenance personnel\n\n    Equipment inspection, testing, and preventative maintenance\n\nUse of \"industry standard\" process and safety equipment\n\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures\n\nPerformance of hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\nImplementation of and internal and external auditing program\n\nSegregation of chemical processes for compatibility and fire prevention/control\n\nChlorine leak detectors and alarm system\n\nAvailability of SCBAs and chlorine container leak repair kit\n\nMaintenance of approved inventory \n\n\n\n5.
