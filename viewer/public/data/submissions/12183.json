Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of Berne Coop (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\tAnhydrous Ammonia is stored at the facility in one 30,000 gallon and one 26,000 gallon \n\tstorage tanks.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous ammonia stored would be \n238,000 pounds.  Propane is stored at a separate site in one 12,000 gallon storage tank and one 300 gallon tank. It is used for grain drying.  The maximum quantity of propane stored is 38,680 pounds. \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \nreleased as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would \nbe 127,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 \npercent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point \n(point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.  \n\tThe worst case scenario for propane is the maximum quantity being released is 37,740 \tpounds.
