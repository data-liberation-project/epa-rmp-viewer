The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Plan identifies current operating procedures and policies in effect at 220 Laboratories to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency preparedness procedures including spill mitigation, evacuation procedures, alarms, and emergency phone numbers have been implemented by 220 Laboratories and are summarized in this Plan and the facility's Process Safety Management Manual, and Hazardous Materials Business Emergency Plan.  \n\n\n\nThis Plan, the Hazardous Materials Business Emergency Plan, and Process Safety Management Manual document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at 220 Laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n220 Laboratories is located at 2375 Third Street in Riverside, California (the \"facility\").  The facility is situated within a commercial and industrial area and occupies approximately ten acres of land.  The facility utilizes propellants to manufacture health and beauty aids.

The emergency response program includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nThe facility has safely operated in the City of Riverside by 220 Laboratories since 1991.  Key elements of the facility's safety program include written environmental health and safety procedures, employee training, and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving reportable listed substances in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response activities with City of Riverside Fire Department.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the Process Safety Management Plan and Hazardous Materials Business Emergency Plan.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\n1.    Develop documentation detailing design basis of relief valves.\n\n2.    Establish method to minimizing venting of residual product in transfer lines following product change.\n\n3.    Conduct ventilation survey to confirm ventilation is adequate for propellant charging areas.\n\n4.    Conduct fire safety analysis for propellant system."
