      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe Tahoe-Truckee Sanitation Agency (T-TSA) is a regional water reclamation facility located in Martis Valley, approximately three miles east of downtown Truckee, California.  The physical address of the facility is 13720 Butterfield Drive, Truckee, California.  T-TSA was formed in 1972 to provide tertiary wastewater treatment for Tahoe City Public Utility District, North Tahoe Public Utility District, Squaw Valley Public Service District, Alpine Springs County Water District, and Truckee Sanitary District.  The regional water reclamation plant became operational in 1978, was expanded in 1982, and expanded again in 2006.  The current capacity of the treatment system is 9.6 million gallons per day of raw sewage.  The plant operates continuously and is attended 24 hours per day.\r\nT-TSA owns and operates a chlorine process that is subject to Program 3 of the federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (RMP Rule) and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program because: (1) chlorine is on the list of regulated toxic substances (40 CFR \u00a768.130) and the maximum inventory (32,000 lbs.) exceeds the 2,500 pound threshold quantity, (2) T-TSA's chlorine process does not meet eligibility requirements for Program 1, and (3) T-TSA's chlorine process is subject to the federal and state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standards.  The Program 3 requirements include: (1) developing and implementing a management system, (2) conducting hazard assessments, (3) developing and implementing the Program 3 Prevention Program, (4) developing and implementing an emergency response program, (5) documenting and submitting a 5-year accident history; and (6) submitting the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies of T-TSA\r\nThe Tahoe-Truckee Sanitation Agency is committed to the safe operation of the water reclamation facility and is dedicate"

All safety improvements identified in the most recent PHA and compliance audit were implemented.

The maximum compressed liquid chlorine inventory at T TSA is 32,000 pounds, or sixteen one-ton containers, that are arranged as follows: four one-ton containers on-line, four one-ton containers in standby mode, and eight one-ton containers in storage.  A common delivery manifold serves the on-line containers.  \r\nPressurized chlorine is reduced to vacuum pressure via vacuum regulators in the chlorine storage area.  Four chlorinators are used to meter the chlorine to downstream ejectors which feed a bank of chlorine solution lines.  The primary use of the chlorine solution is for injection into the plant's effluent flow for disinfection.  Chlorine solution is injected into the plant effluent 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Chlorine solution can also be used to pre-chlorinate raw sewage, chlorinate filters, breakpoint chlorinate for ammonia removal, and chlorinate the biological treatment process.  The maximum injection capacity is 3,200 pounds of chlorine per day.  Typically, only 500 to 1,000 pounds per day are used.  \r\nThe chlorine handling facility at T-TSA is a fully contained facility.  All storage and use of the one-ton chlorine containers is done within the container storage room.  The chlorine building is equipped with two chlorine leak detectors that sense chlorine at concentrations as low as one part per million (ppm).  Upon detection of"

Simultaneously, the leak detectors initiate the shutdown of all ventilation fans, the shutdown of the chlorine solution pump, the initiation of the chlorine scrubber system, and the activation of the chlorine container automatic valve closure system. This chlorine leak prevention system ensures minimal risk of offsite consequences from a chlorine leak at the facility.  The chlorine building is also equipped with an additional multi-probe chlorine detector that senses chlorine concentrations in four locations within the building and transmits this information to the plant's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.\r\nAs required for the purposes of the RMP Rule and the CalARP Program, a worst-case release scenario and an alternative-case release scenario were evaluated.  Pursuant to EPA's recommendations, a description of the release scenarios is not provided because of potential security risks.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Measures\r\nAs stated above, T-TSA is subject to the EPA-regulated RMP Rule, the Nevada County Environmental Health Department-regulated CalARP program, and the CalOSHA-regulated PSM Program.  These regulations help ensure that T-TSA maintains process safety and risk prevention programs for chlorine handling, storage, and use.  The procedural elements of these programs require that T-TSA develop administrative controls and implement mitigation systems to prevent accidental releases of chlorine.
