      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Tahoe-Truckee Sanitation Agency (T-TSA) is a regional water reclamation facility located in Martis Valley, approximately three miles east of downtown Truckee, California.  The physical address of the facility is 13720 Butterfield Drive, Truckee, California.  T-TSA was formed in 1972 to provide tertiary wastewater treatment for Tahoe City Public Utility District, North Tahoe Public Utility District, Squaw Valley Public Service District, Alpine Springs County Water District, and Truckee Sanitary District.  The regional water reclamation plant became operational in 1978, was expanded in 1982, and expanded again in 2006.  The current capacity of the treatment system is 9.6 million gallons per day of raw sewage.  The plant operates continuously and is attended 24 hours per day.\n\nT-TSA owns and operates a chlorine process that is subject to Program 3 of the federal Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (RMP Rule) and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program because: (1) chlorine is on the list of regulated toxic substances (40 CFR ?68.130) and the maximum inventory (32,000 lbs.) exceeds the 2,500 pound threshold quantity, (2) T-TSA's chlorine process does not meet eligibility requirements for Program 1, and (3) T-TSA's chlorine process is subject to the federal and state Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standards.  The Program 3 requirements include: (1) developing and implementing a management system, (2) conducting hazard assessments, (3) developing and implementing the Program 3 Prevention Program, (4) developing and implementing an emergency response program, (5) documenting and submitting a 5-year accident history; and (6) submitting the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies of T-TSA\n\nThe Tahoe-Truckee Sanitation Agency is committed to the safe operation of the water reclamation facility and is dedicate"

T-TSA has developed, implemented, and integrated the provisions of the RMP Rule, CalARP Program, and PSM Program.  The PSM Program includes the following elements:\n\n?    Process Safety Information,\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA),\n\n?    Operating Procedures,\n\n?    Training,\n\n?    Contractors,\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review,\n\n?

Employee Participation.\n\nAn original Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) involving a Hazard and Operability Study (HazOp) and What-If Analysis was conducted with design engineers, operations staff, management personnel, and maintenance staff prior to the design of the chlorine process.  Subsequent PHA Revalidation Reports were completed in July 2001, April 2006, and March 2011.  Release prevention measures were implemented during the design and construction of the facility, thus ensuring that all safety and health precautions were integrated into the system prior to operation.\n\nT-TSA submitted an original RMP in June 1999.  This RMP superseded the Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP) approved in 1996.  Other safety and health programs employed at T-TSA related to management of hazardous materials/waste include the Hazardous Materials Business Plan (Business Plan); the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan; and the hazardous waste manifests for the California EPA, Department of Toxic Substances Control (EPA ID No: CAL000003215).  \n\nT-TSA's Business Plan is administered by the Nevada County Environmental Health Department, T-TSA's Certified Unif"

Facility Maps,\n\n?    Emergency Response Plan,\n\n?    Mitigation Measures,\n\n?    Evacuation Plan,\n\n?    Training Plans and Procedures,\n\n?    Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement,\n\n?    Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), and\n\n?    Pre-Response Plans.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled at T-TSA\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at T-TSA's facility that is above the threshold quantity pursuant to Section 112 (r) (5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and listed in 40 CFR ?68.130.  The maximum compressed liquid chlorine inventory at T TSA is 32,000 pounds, or sixteen one-ton containers, that are arranged as follows: four one-ton containers on-line, four one-ton containers in standby mode, and eight one-ton containers in storage.  A common delivery manifold serves the on-line containers.  \n\nPressurized chlorine is reduced to vacuum pressure via vacuum regulators in the chlorine storage area.  Four chlorinators are used to meter the chlorine to downstream ejectors which feed a bank of chlorine solution lines.  The primary use of the chlorine solution is for injection into the plant's effluent flow for disinfection.  Chlorine solution is injected into the plant effluent 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Chlorine solution can also be used to pre-chlorinate raw sewage, chlorinate filters, breakpoint chlorinate for ammonia removal, and chlorinate the biological treatment process.  The maximum injection capacity is 3,200 pounds of chlorine per day.  Typically, only 500 to 1,000 pounds per day are used.  \n\nThe chlorine handling facility at T-TSA is a fully contained facility.  All storage and use of the one-ton chlorine containers is done within the container storage room.  The chlorine building is equipped with two chlorine leak detectors that sense chlorine at concentrations as low as one part per million (ppm).  Upon detection of "

      "SummaryText": "chlorine, the detectors activate two visual beacons located on the west and north sides of the chlorine building, one annunciator light and an audible alarm in the AWT building control room, and a plant-wide audible chlorine leak alarm.  Simultaneously, the leak detectors initiate the shutdown of all ventilation fans, the shutdown of the chlorine solution pump, the initiation of the chlorine scrubber system, and the activation of the chlorine container automatic valve closure system. This chlorine leak prevention system ensures minimal risk of offsite consequences from a chlorine leak at the facility.  The chlorine building is also equipped with an additional multi-probe chlorine detector that senses chlorine concentrations in four locations within the building and transmits this information to the plant's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.\n\nAs required for the purposes of the RMP Rule and the CalARP Program, a worst-case release scenario and an alternative-case release scenario were evaluated.  Pursuant to EPA's recommendations, a description of the release scenarios is not provided because of potential security risks.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Measures\n\nAs stated above, T-TSA is subject to the EPA-regulated RMP Rule, the Nevada County Environmental Health Department-regulated CalARP program, and the CalOSHA-regulated PSM Program.  These regulations help ensure that T-TSA maintains process safety and risk prevention programs for chlorine handling, storage, and use.  The procedural elements of these programs require that T-TSA develop administrative controls and implement mitigation systems to prevent accidental releases of chlorine.  The accidental release prevention measures include, but are not limited to, the following elements:\n\n1.    Collection and dissemination of process safety information for chlorine.\n\n2.
