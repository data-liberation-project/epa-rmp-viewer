However, we are committed to continue working our corrective action and reporting processes to better communicate regulatory program requirements to facility managers and staff and to monitor and improve the safety culture of all Rinchem operations."

It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the on-site emergency coordinator is notified and communicates incidents to corporate incident command. Rinchem facilities are non-responding and chemical releases are cleaned up immediately by properly trained third party emergency response technicians. \nTraining is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most accidents. The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for all new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide 29%), chlorine, arsine, or phosphine at this facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nRinchem has a emergency action plan. The plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public. The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. Our employees are trained in the action plan to evacuate and call the appropriate responding agency to clean or stop the release. The facility does annual drills to insure employees understand what needs to be done in the event of a release."

There are four regulated substances that are stored above the threshold quantity at this facility under 40 CFR part 68 - Aqueous Ammonia Solution (ammonium hydroxide 29%), Chlorine, Arsine and Phosphine  - These materials are not involved in any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed containers and cylinders. Rinchem is located in an industrial part of town with a mixed residential/commercial population nearby. The Warehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials. There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as raised thresholds at dock doors and entryexit doors in the warehouse creating a secondary containment into the warehouse rooms where the materials are stored. The liqud chemicals in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations. Toxic gases at the facility are stored in a secured, monitored gas pad with toxic gas detection capabilities. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) engineering controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\nThe areas of compli"
