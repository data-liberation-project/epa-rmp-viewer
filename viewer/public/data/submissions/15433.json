If an emergency were to occur, it is our   policy to notify the Marion Fire Department and request that they respond to our emergency.\n  \nFacility description and regulated substance handled:\nThis facility is a farm fertilizer plant. We sell and apply dry and liquid fertilizer. Our Anhydrous Ammonia\nplant consists of two storage tanks (26,000 and 12,000 Gal.) and associated piping, compressor pump,\nvalves, vents, nurse tanks, and other miscellaneous equipment. \n\nThe Worst - Case release scenario:\nOur worst-case scenario is a sudden failure of both storage tanks when filled to maximum allowed \n(SOP 85% full), resulting in a toxic gas cloud. According to EPA' look-up tables, the distance to the\nendpoint is 4.4 miles. Within the distance to the endpoint are private residences, schools, recreation\nareas, numerous businesses and industries, and a wildlife sanctuary. Population within the endpoint is\n30,743.        \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and Chemical specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule as well as all applicable local and state codes\nand regulations. This Anhydrous Ammonia plant is designed, built and maintained according to OSHA\n(29 CFR 1910.111) and state regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nNo accidents involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, or evacuations.\n\nEmergency response program:\nIt is our policy that in the event of an emergency involving NH3, the Marion Fire Dept. be notified of, and\nrequested to respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this with the fire dept. and they have a copy\nof our Emergency Action Plan.  I addition the fire dept. inspects our facility on a yearly basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve sa"
