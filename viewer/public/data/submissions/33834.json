The WWT Division in conjunction with the Dothan Fire Department conducts an annual chlorine/sulfur dioxie leak drill at one of the facilities.\n\nThe WWT Division has three wastewater treatment plants that store chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas in one ton containers used for disinfection of treated wastewater.  The quantities stored at each facility is as follows: Little Choctawhatchee-6000 lbs of chlorine gas and 6,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide; Beaver Creek-6,000 lbs. of chlorine gas and 6,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide; Omussee Creek-10,000 lbs.of chlorine gas and 8,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide.  The total amount of stored at all the wastewater treatment plants is 22,000 lbs. of chlorine gas and 20,000 lbs. of sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst case sceranio for all three wastewater treatment plants would result in a maximum threat zone for sulfur dioxide of 3.2 miles.  Based on the 2000 census, this release will affect a residental population of 6,400 from Little Choctawhatchee, 21,000 from Beaver Creek, and 5,200 from Omussee Creek.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide will affect a residental population of 4,300 from Little Choctawhatchee, 14,000 from Beaver Creek, and 2,700 from Omussee Creek within 2.6 miles.  The alternate release sceranio for chlorine will affect a residental population of 3,500 from Little Choctawhatchee, 12,500 from Beaver Creek, and 2,300 from Omussee Creek within 2.4 miles.\n\nThe WWT Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule, although Alabama is not an OSHA state.  The WWT Division conducts training for all operators in SOP, safe handling, and emergency response procedures.  All safety equipment is regularly inspected and calibrated.

The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas. The annual full scale accidental release drill allows all agencies (Fire, Police, WWT) to critque their performance for improvement.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                 Perimeter motion sensors have been installed to detect the presences of unauthorized personnel entering the plant or the chemical storage area.\n\nThe WWT Division reviews SOP, conducts hazard analysis, and performs an audit every three years in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule."
