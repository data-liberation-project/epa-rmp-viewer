(R&M)?s Sunoco Chemicals Neal Plant, hereafter referred to as the Neal Plant, located in Kenova, West Virginia.  The RMP program at the Neal Plant is in compliance with all requirements of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This document provides a brief overview of the following elements of the RMP:\n\n* The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n* The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n* The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n* The five-year accident history;\n* The emergency response program; and\n* The planned changes to improve safety.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nSunoco is committed to operating and maintaining all processes at the Neal Plant in a safe and responsible manner.  Sunoco continuously trains Neal Plant employees in facility operating procedures and performs ongoing preventative maintenance on process equipment.  The Neal Plant uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the hazards associated with the regulated chemicals used on site.  By maintaining these programs, the Neal Plant ensures the safety of plant personnel as well the safety of the public and the protection of the environment.     \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe Neal Plant is a polypropylene production facility.  The process regulated under the RMP is the Propane and Propylene Areas that include Propylene Railroad Tank Car Unloading, Propylene and Propane Storage, Propylene Purification, and Polypropylene Production.  The Neal Plant utilizes propylene along with catalysts, additives, and hydrogen in the production of polypropylene.  Propane is obtained from the propylene purification step.  Both propylene and propane are flammable chemica"

      "SummaryText": "ls regulated under 40 CFR 68. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe Neal Plant takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of propane and propylene as detailed below.  To satisfy the process hazard analysis requirement for the propane and propylene areas, the Neal Plant personnel conduct forty three Hazard and Operability Analyses (HAZOPs) for individual plant areas.  Thus, the HAZOPs are not conducted simultaneously; however, a five year HAZOP review schedule is maintained for each of the forty three plant areas.  The most recent HAZOP was on May 4, 2004 and the next HAZOP will be due on March 23, 2005.  Prior to conducting each HAZOP, safety information is reviewed. The safety information reviewed includes information pertaining to the hazards of the regulated substances (such as MSDSs), the technology of the process (such as flow diagrams), and the equipment in the process.  Process and safety information and operating procedures are updated when a change occurs with the process chemicals, technology, equipment, or operational procedures.  \n\nAnother element of the Neal Plant?s accidental release prevention program is the annual certification, which establishes that operating procedures for the processes involving propane and propylene are accurate and current.  To ensure that the operating procedures are correctly implemented, all employees are on a three-year refresher-training schedule.  Each employee completes refresher training every three years; however, not all employees are trained simultaneously.  Training is an ongoing process at the Neal Plant.  In addition to classroom and on the job training, employees are trained utilizing a process simulator for certain job functions.  Personnel are trained in propane and propylene emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  \n\nFurthermore, the propane and propylene areas of the facility are inspected a"

The propylene storage tanks are equipped with a water curtain system to cover the tanks with a large volume of water in order to cool the tanks in case of fire and to disperse vapors.  \n\nIn addition to the above listed components of an effective prevention program, the Neal Plant?s prevention program includes the following aspects: incident investigations, employee participation plans, hot work permits, contractor safety procedures, and evaluations of contractor safety performance. \n\nTo establish that the Neal Plant is successfully implementing all the aspects of the prevention program detailed above and that the processes are in compliance with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP regulations, an internal audit is conducted every three years.  Furthermore, the Neal Plant has instituted specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that high standards for accident prevention are maintained.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nA five-year accident release report has not been prepared as there have been no reportable accidents in the past five years.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nSunoco has prepared a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Neal Plant.  The ERP for the Neal Plant meets all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This plan is periodically reviewed and employees are trained in the proper execution and implementation of the prescribed procedures.  The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, Sunoco coordinates the Neal Plant ERP with the Cabell/Wayne Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSunoco will incorporate or address recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses, offsite consequences, inciden"
