Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies \n\nWe at Eagle Point Water Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Dubuque LEPC which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 8000 lbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-case analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Main plant chlorination.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. The Release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to endpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a residential population of 59,459 within this distance.\n\n\nToxic Alternative-case analyses\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Main plant chlorination.  The scenario involves the release of 2.5 lb. of Ch"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEagle Point Water Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazard, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with this process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazard associated with this process is identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is team review.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a yearly basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Eagle Point Water Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nEagle"

      "SummaryText": " Point Water Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive extensive classroom training in process operations. Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEagle Point Water Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Eagle Point Water Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Eagle Point Water Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEagle Point Water Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe "

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEagle Point Water Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Eagle Point Water Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nEagle Point Water Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nFacility is included in written Community ER Plan.\nThe Local agency coordinating ER Plan is Dubuque LEPC which has the phone number 319-589-4170.\n\n"
