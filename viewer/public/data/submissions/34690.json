As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, St. Paul Regional Water Services - McCarron has completed a risk management plan (RMP) for both chlorine and anhydrous ammonia which exceed the Threshold Quantities of 2,500 pounds and 10,000 pounds respectively, as established by the EPA.\n\nThe properties making chlorine and ammonia valuable for water treatment, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  St. Paul Regional Water Services believes that safety depends on the manner in which chemicals are handled, along with safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the training of personnel.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nIt is the intent of this facility to uphold industry standards in the operation of the facility, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  The facility was designed and constructed to be a state-of-the-art facility employing numerous release identification and prevention measures.  In the event of an emergency or accidental release, in-house staff, in conjunction with the St. Paul Fire Department Hazardous Materials division, are prepared to implement isolation measures and secure leaking systems.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nChlorine and ammonia stored at the facility is used primarily for water disinfection.  The chlorine is received, stored, and dispensed from a 90-ton rail car.  Liquid chlorine is moved from the rail car storage via one-inch black iron piping into o"

The ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 9,230 gallon tanks.  The ammonia is passed through piping in a nearby room, where it is vaporized, passed through the ammonianator, and fed into the water supply.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe St. Paul Regional Water Services - McCarron complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  This facility evaluates the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered process.  This process serves to prevent accidental release and minimize the consequences of accidental releases.  \n\nThe employees of this facility are committed to the standards set by RMP regulations.  Specific accountability and controls are in place to ensure that the high standards for accident prevention are met.  Additionally, specific job positions and responsibilities are identified to ensure proper management and implementation of this RMP.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThis facility has had no accidental releases as relates to the RMP program in the past 5 years, which have resulted in off-site consequences such as personal injury, death, or response/restoration activities."
