The toxic endpoint concentration is defined by the USEPA as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protection action. The RMP toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia is 200 ppm (0.14 mg/L).\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case OCA for ammonia was performed using the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April 1999) calculations. As defined under 40 CFR 68, a worst-case release of an aqueous-based substance is a ground level release of the entire tank contents, taking into account passive mitigation that would limit the release. According to the regulation, the OCA considers only the greatest amount of a regulated substance held in a single vessel even when interconnected to other vessels. At this Facility, there is only one vessel. As an administrative control, the Facility limits the maximum ammonia storage capacity to 85-percent of the AST volume. Therefore, one tank has an equivalent aqueous ammonia weight of 28,470 pounds (assuming a density of 7.44 lbs/gal) which was used in the OCA. A spill would be contained in a dike that measures 26' x 26' x 4'. Based on a dike area of 676 square feet and an assumed improbable elevated temperature of 38 degrees C (100 degrees F), the evaporation rate would be 100 pounds per minute. The Stability Class was assumed to be F (most stable), and the wind speed was assumed to be 1.5 meters per second (for a concentrated vapor plume).\n\nBased upon the release rate, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) is 0.6 miles"

Natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or wilderness areas are considered environmental receptors and were not identified on a TOPO map of the area.\n\nThe modeled release point is located 1,200 feet west and approximately 1,500 feet south of the Facility fenceline. Using a center point of 41 28' 48.5 and -088 15' 26.2, the estimated population within this radius was determined to be 65 people by the Block Group Proration Method. Within this radius, there are no institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons), parks, or recreational areas present. Additionally, there are no environmental receptors within the radius. \n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release OCA for ammonia was performed using the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (April 1999) calculations and employing the RMP*Comp software. The alternative release scenario for the regulated process is a rupture the AST at a liquid temperature of 25 degrees C rather than the elevated temperature of 38 degrees C used in the worst-case scenario. Employing the OCA Guidance document formulas, the release rate has been estimated to be equal to 30 gallons per minute. The release was assumed to last for a 60-minute interval.

To meet this commitment, LSP Kendall Energy, LLC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the process. One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of aqueous ammonia (>20 weight percent), the only hazardous substance stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to Program 2 of 40 CFR 68. \n\nTo protect the environment, aqueous ammonia is used at the Facility to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) pollutants, which are generated from the combustion of natural gas.  Specifically, ammonia is the reducing agent used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control systems. The SCR is a post-combustion gas treatment technique that reduces nitrous oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the turbine exhaust stream to molecular nitrogen and water. The SCR systems are comprised of a number of subsystems. These subsystems include the SCR reactor with associated fluework, the ammonia vaporization and injection system, and the ammonia storage and delivery system. All subsystems are equipped with the required controls and interlocks. \n\nThe Facility is located in a sparsely populated rural area and has never had a reportable accident. Ammonia is a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer.  Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125  Exemptions - Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68). \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to desig"

RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences. \n\nTo foster communication with the community, the RMP and ERP have been submitted to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). The Facility has chosen to use a dilute solution of ammonia rather than the inherently more dangerous anhydrous form. The storage quantity of ammonia was reduced as much as possible. The storage tank area is diked and partially enclosed. The facility property is partially encompassed by a series of landscape berms, which would have a mitigating effect on an ammonia vapor plume.\n\nAt this Facility, comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response programs have been established. It is LSP-Kendall Energy, LLC's policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. LSP Kendall Energy, LLC is committed to the safety of workers, contractors, and the public, as well as to the preservation of the environment. LS Kendall Energy, LLC will implement the measures necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of the substances regulated by 40 CFR 68. The measures include:\n\n* Employee training in accidental release prevention and emergency response programs/measures;\n* Establishment of safety programs for Facility operations, design, and maintenance of the regulated process; and\n* Establishment of a hazard assessment process.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Facility has never had a reportable accident.\n\n\nThe Stationary Sourc"

      "SummaryText": "e and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Kendall County Generating Facility, located at 1401 County Line Road in Minooka, Illinois, is a 1,100-megawatt natural gas-fired combined-cycle power generating plant that includes four gas turbines, four heat recovery steam generators, and four reheat condensing steam turbines. This stationary source stores and uses a regulated substance, (>20 weight percent) aqueous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7), that is used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control systems. The RMP aqueous ammonia threshold quantity (TQ) limit is 20,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored on site will not exceed 40,000 pounds (including all piping). The AST is centrally located within the Facility,  has a four (4)-foot high secondary containment dike, is protected by a roof and is enclosed on three sides, which would mitigate a potential ammonia release.\n\nNominal 30-weight percent aqueous ammonia is periodically delivered by tank truck (5000-6000 gallons) by trained qualified personnel using established standard operating and DOT procedures to an unloading station equipped with interconnecting piping connected to a single horizontally-orientated cylindrical 15,000-gallon above ground storage tank (AST). The 15,000-gallon AST volume is administratively controlled to 85-percent by volume (12,750-gallons) with an equivalent weight of 28,471 pounds reported as 28,000 pounds. The aqueous ammonia is stored at ambient temperature and will have a maximum pressure of 50 pounds per square inch-gauge (psig). \n\nAqueous ammonia storage and the vaporization / injection system is the process considered for the RMP at this Facility. The largest quantity (vessel) of aqueous ammonia at the Facility is the 15,000-gallon AST. From the AST, the aqueous ammonia is transferred by pumps at a pressure of 120 psig and a maximum flow rate of 3 gallons per minute (gpm) to the vaporizers. The vaporized ammonia/air mixture is injected upstream of the SCR"
