      "SummaryText": "The City of Forest Wastewater Treatment Plant treats about 3.5 MGD of wastewater each day. We use chlorine to disinfect the water that we treat. The City WWTP has seven employees in which are all trained in chlorine safety and how to handle any accidental release of chlorine. At the wastewater plant we have two self-contained air packs and we also have two complete ton emergency repair kits for ton cylinders. Also the City of Forest Fire Department has one complete ton emergency repair kit and the fire fighters are trained in how to handle a chlorine release. This is our emergency response call list: Tony Massey, WWTP Supervisor, 601-507-2033; H. Randall George, Public Works Director, 601-507-2921; City of Forest Fire Department, 601-469-1221; Jason Tillman, Fire Chief, 601-507-7310; Forest Police Department, 601-469-4141; Will Jones, Chief of Police, 769-274-0790. The Fire Department is trained to put up a water curtain if needed to contain the release as much as possible. We also have a chlorine sensor and alarm to alert the operator. The operator at the plant checks all of the chlorination system at least every two hours. If we have a release that requires people to evacuate for a certain area we use the police department and all forces to accomplish this action.  \n\n"
