We will strive to comply with legislative \n    requirements and eliminate any foreseeable hazards which may result in losses, damage to\n    property, personnel injury and illnesses, and the environment.\n    \n    The Accidental Release Prevention Policy at the facility is embedded in our overall\n    approach to planning, design and construction intended to minimize hazards; and the\n    training of all personnel in proper operation, maintenance and inspection procedures with\n    emphasis on awareness and practices to minimize hazards and avoid accidents.  The\n    Emergency Response Policy is to identify potential hazards at the facility, and develop and\n    implement a plan to respond to emergency events including, but not limited to fire,\n    accidents or injury.  The Emergency Response Plan includes identification of responders\n    and their duties, and procedures for notification of responders including fire department,\n    evacuation, shutdown, and communications.\n\n2)  Stationary Source:\n  \n    The purpose of the Van facility is to withdraw field gas from a nearby production well\n    gathering system, remove hydrocarbon liquid and moisture from the gas, raise the pressure\n    of the gas, and deliver it into a natural gas transmission piping system.

The process that is covered by\n    this Risk Management Program (RMP) is an extraction process which strips the\n    hydrocarbon liquid (liquid product) from the natural gas, and stores it in a 30,000 gallon\n    tank until it is shipped bi-weekly, via tanker truck. The other major process compresses the\n    natural gas in three stages, pumps it through the extraction process and then into the high\n    pressure transmission system.\n    \n    The extraction system process utilizes in series two counterflow heat exchangers, a chiller,\n    and a three phase separator to reduce the gas temperature and pressure and which induces\n    the liquid product to drop out of the gas stream. The chiller system uses propane refrigerant\n    in a closed loop which includes a compressor, a cooler (condenser), a receiver, the chiller\n    (evaporator), and a suction drum. There is also a 300 gallon propane makeup tank which\n    feeds refrigerant to the closed loop as needed.  After forming in the three phase separator\n    the liquid product is passed through the heat exchangers to cool the incoming gas, and then\n    sent to a stabilizer vessel where ethane gas separates (ethane is piped to the natural gas\n    compressor for use as a fuel) and moisture is removed. From the stabilizer the liquid\n    product is piped to the 30,000 gallon storage tank \n    \n    There is also an ethylene glycol dehydration system which removes moisture from the gas\n    stream and the liquid product stream in two loops. In the first loop, glycol is injected into\n    the gas stream at both the first heat exchanger and the chiller, and it is later removed in the\n    three phase separator. In the second loop, glycol passes through the stabilizer to remove\n    water from the liquid product. Both loops send the glycol through a reboiler which heats\n    the glycol to drive off water, and then through a cooler.\n\n3)  Regulated Substances:\n  \n    The liquid product is a flammable liquid, and consists of an a"

In most\n    cases there are redundant relief valves, e.g. there are four redundant relief valve on the\n    30,000 gallon storage tank.\n    \n    The liquid product storage tank which has a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons is never\n    filled to full capacity. The standard operational procedure for is to maintain the liquid\n    product storage tank at less than sixty percent of its total  capacity, approximately 18,000\n    gallons.  The storage tank is inspected daily to determine the amount of material present. \n    To maintain this sixty  percent total volume two truckloads per week of the liquid product\n    are shipped when the facility is in full operation. Each shipment consists of approximately\n    8,500 gallons of liquid product per trip from the facility. The transport company, Crossett\n    Trucking, follows specific written operational procedures for transferring liquid product\n    from the storage tank to the tanker truck.  There are spring loaded shut-off valves in the\n    transfer piping to prevent potential releases related to transfer accidents.\n    \n    There is also minimal motor vehicle exposure to the liquid product storage tank,.  It is\n    surrounded by concrete Jersey barriers and access to the facility is normally through locked\n    gates.  This traffic pattern and s"
