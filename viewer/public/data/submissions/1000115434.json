The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\nOrmond Beach\u0092s emergency procedures serve as a guide for emergency control staff, company personnel, emergency assistance groups, and law enforcement agencies that may be called upon to participate in controlling an emergency within the facility and surrounding areas. These procedures include employee notification of emergencies and evacuation procedures for all emergency situations.  \nIn December 2021, EPA updated Chapter 8 of the General Risk Management Program Guidance to reflect the new emergency response coordination provision (40 CFR 68.93), which required compliance beginning September 21, 2018. The owner or operator of a stationary source shall coordinate response needs with local emergency planning and response organizations to determine how the stationary source is addressed in the community emergency response plan and to ensure that local response organizations are aware of the regulated substances at the stationary source, their quantities, the risks presented by covered processes, and the resources and capabilities at the stationary source to respond to an accidental release of a regulated substance. Ormond Beach coordinates with the CUPA via Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) reporting via the California Environmental Reporting System (CERS) and other CUPA required RMP update procedures.\nPursuant to CUPA requirements (per 40 CFR Part 68.12 and 19 CCR Section 2745.8) emergency procedures are in place in the event of a release of a regulated substance (aqueous ammonia).

The objective of the regulation is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. To control these types of hazards, Ormond Beach has developed the necessary expertise, experience, judgment, and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective prevention program.
