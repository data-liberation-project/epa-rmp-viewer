The sole function of the water diluent is to facilitate heat removal from the polymerization reaction.  The reaction is initiated most commonly with an organic peroxide soluble in the monomer phase. PVC slurry is centrifuged and then dried. The clean dry PVC is stored in silos, prior to being sold by railcar, tank truck, one ton bags, and 25 kg bags. \r\n\r\nVinyl Chloride Monomer\r\n\r\nEDC is formed by oxychlorination of ethylene.  Four oxychlorination trains are used to combine ethylene, hydrogen chloride, and oxygen to form ethylene dichloride.  Purified EDC (10) is thermally cracked into VCM and HCl in the EDC Crackers. The VCM produced in the furnaces is purified, washed, dried, and sent to the Polyvinyl Chloride department for conversion to PVC.  HCl (6) is also purified to meet the quality required as the raw material for the oxychlorination section.  EDC is recycled back to the process. \r\n\r\n\r\nMarine Traffic\r\n\r\nMarine Traffic is charged with loading liquid products and unloading liquid feedstock to and from ships and barges.
