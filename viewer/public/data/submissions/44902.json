      "SummaryText": "Regulated substances handled at the Choccolocco Creek WWTP are liquid chlorine and liquid sulfur dioxide, which are used in effluent chlorination/disinfection and dechlorination.  There have been no reportable accidents in the last five years which resulted in personal injury or property damage.  Inventories are kept to a minimum.  Plant operators have been trained with regard to the nature of the regulated chemicals and in the proper handling of the chemical containers and use of connectors and feed equipment.  Process equipment inspections are performed daily for the purpose of preventing accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Leak repair kits and SCBA's are kept on site fro rapid response to emergency situations. Leak detection devices are in use.  The local EMA has been notified in writing concerning the chemicals used at the plant.  Chemical storage and related equipment is inside buildings to assist in protection of the containers and to limit release in case of accident.  EPA RMP Comp predicts worse case scenario to have a toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles from the plant for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, whereas alternative cases have radii of 0.2 miles 0.1 miles from the plant for the respective chemicals.  Alterations of the plant are planned for the next 20 months that will completely remove treatment processes involving the regulated RMP chemicals."
