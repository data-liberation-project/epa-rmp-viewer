The distance to endpoint is .2 miles and 1500 people may be affected by this scenario.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and the OSHA PSM Rule.  This facility has been designed and constructed in accordance with general safety standards, such NFPA, Compressed Gas Association safe handling practices, Uniform Fire Code and other generally accepted practices.\n\nAll personnel working in the IM test area are thoroughly trained in the safe handling of LPG and LNG and the associated equipment.  Personnel work experience averages 10 years or more.  There are no inexperienced technicians working around the LPG or LNG.\n\nFire prevention is accomplished by posting signs for authorized access and no smoking.  The facility has a water sprinkler deluge system constructed around the tanks, which is activated by an ultraviolet monitoring system to prevent fire from affecting the LPG or LNG storage tanks.\n\n5.  Five - year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nEmergency procedures are documented in the J. C. Carter Emergency Plan.  The fluids are transfered from one tank / tanker to another tank only during normal business hours.  Personnel would be on hand to handle an emergency and to contact outside agencies should it become necessary.  Training has been conducted facility wide.  Evacuation drills are conducted at least annually.  The Costa Mesa Fire Department is aware of the emergency procedures and hazardous materials on site.  Joint training is also conducted.  There is a security guard on duty 24 hours to oversee the facility and to notify authorities in case of an emergency after normal bus"

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThis facility handles liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and sometimes butane, above threshold quantities.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle LPG and LNG, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.  Our policy is to use only trained personnel and follow safe handling procedures.\n\nOur emergency response program was developed with input from the Costa Mesa Fire Department and Police Department.  We conduct regular joint training and walk through information sessions with the Fire Department to ensure communication and feedback.  Our policy is to work with the Fire Department during any type of emergency at this facility.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nJ. C. Carter Company manufacturers and repairs aircraft fueling components.  The fuel management devices are manufacturered, assembled and tested at this facility.  The Industrial Division manufacturers, assembles and tests large cryogenic pumps.  The tests are conducted using LPG or LNG, along with nitrogen (LN2).  The Industrial Marine test slab is the area of focus for the RMP.  LPG and LNG are the regulated substances handled.\n\nLPG or LNG is received by tanker truck and stored in three separate storage tanks.  LPG is stored in an 8,000 gallon tank.  LNG is stored in one of two 13,000 gallon tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\n3.  The worse-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release for is from the catastrophic failure of a tank storing propane.  The distance to endpoint is .3 miles and 3100 people may be affected by this scena"
