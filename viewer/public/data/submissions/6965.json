We have demonstrated our commitment to safety and the safe handling of anhydrous ammoniaby our excellent safety record and the training we have done both internally and externally. The primary acitivity we are involved in with anhydrous ammonia is recieving from trucks to storage and transfering from storage to nurse trailers for our farmer owners. this acitivity is heavly regulated by OSHA, EPA, DOT, and the Kansas Department of Agriculture. our storage plant holds 141,100 pounds in our one tank at this facility. It is a 30,000 gallon tank and its quantity is limited by design standards. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank as a gas in 10 minutes the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles. The alternative release scenario based on a transfer hose breakage. The distance to the endpoint in this case(point of dispersion to 200 ppm)  is .83 miles. Our firm has an emergency response plan and over the years we have shared this plan with our local emergency personnel. We also are inspected by the Kansas Department of Agriculture on an annual basis (who follows the ANSI K-61 standards) and have participated in the Kansas Right-To-Know program in shich we report quantities of hazardous materials to the State of Kansas. The facility has implemented all of the standards the industry, government and insurance advisors have  required and requested. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the faciliy nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. Our staff understands the importance of safety not only for themselves but also the safety o"
