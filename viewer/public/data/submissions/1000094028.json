It has been prepared in accordance with section 112A&reg; of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials.  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by AMVAC Chemical Corporation, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP rule and relevant portions of the California Health and Safety Code.\r\n\r\nThe Hazard and Operability Study (HazOps) and hazard analysis conducted for AMVAC's pesticide manufacturing units found the units to contain multi-layers of safeguards against the possibility of acutely hazardous material (AHM) release, and concluded that the units are well designed.\r\n\r\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMission Statement: AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\r\n1. Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\r\n2. Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\r\n3.

To achieve this, we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2.0 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural chemical pesticides at its plant located at 4100 East Washington Boulevard in Commerce, California.  The facility consists of various type buildings, chemical reactors, above-ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, rail car loading/unloading stations, peripheral tanks, a warehouse and various ancillary equipment.  The plant currently employs sixty full-time employees and operates on a three shift, twenty four-hour basis.\r\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals Manufacturers, a Primary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 2879 for Agricultural Chemical Manufacturers.  It has Secondary SIC Codes of 2869 (Chemical Industrial Organics) and 5191 (Farm Supplies).  The plant is involved in the manufacture of pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).  \r\n\r\n* Toxic Substances:\r\n\r\n1. Chlorine, CAS 7782-50-5 used in the PCNB manufacturing process.\r\n2. Carbon Disulfide, CAS 75-15-0 used in the Metam Sodium/K-Pam manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n* Flammable Substances:\r\n \r\n1. Monomethylamine, CAS 74-89-5 used in the Metam Sodium/K-Pam manufacturing process\r\n\r\nPCNB Manufacturing Process:\r\n\r\nThe AHMs associated with the PCNB process are chlorine and nitrobenzene.

Nitrobenzene is also received as a liquid and processed as such in the PCNB process.\r\n\r\nMetam Sodium/K-Pam Manufacturing Process:\r\n\r\nAHMs associated with this process are Carbon Disulfide and monomethylamine (for Metam Sodium/K-Pam manufacturing).  There are no by-products or off-gas produced in the reaction.\r\n\r\n3.0 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the capabilities, design features and back up of the systems handling the regulated chemicals, AMVAC recognizes that the safe operation of the plant requires a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical properties of all materials and the implementation of safe handling practices.\r\n\r\n4.0 The Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere were no accidents or incidents involving Acutely Hazardous Materials in the past five years.  \r\n\r\n5.0 The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAll units are equipped with multiple levels of protection.  The potential for spills or releases  is low.  However, in the event that a spill or release occurs, there are established written procedures for the handling of any emergency.\r\n\r\nThese include the Emergency Response Plan and the Operating Procedures Manuals.  The Emergency Response plan for the AMVAC facility (last revised 06/01/2021) includes written procedures for handling releases and spills of hazardous materials in any area and contains more specific emergency response procedures, including procedures for earthquake, bomb threat, riot, offsite emergencies, evacuation procedures, evacuation routes, fire prevention, emergency equipment, portable radio use and neighborhood information.  The operating procedure manuals for each process contain more specific emergency response information for each area.\r\n\r\nTo maintain and upgrade our emergency response capability, AMVAC conducts regularly scheduled inspections of this fa"
