The Clean Air Act required EPA to develop the RMP in an effort to help prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nThe City of North Augusta has one of the regulated substances, chlorine, above the threshold quantities specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore must comply with the RMP program.  This program provides our facility with an integrated approach to identifying and managing the hazards posed by the use of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nUnder the RMP rule, the storage and use of chlorine in quantities exceeding 2,500 pounds subjects the North Augusta Water Treatment Plant to Program 3 requirements.  Program 3 requirements apply to higher-risk processes already subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This facility routinely stores chlorine onsite in three (3) one-ton containers, two of which are connected to a single process.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\n\n\nThe management system at our facility oversees the implementation of the RMP elements in order to manage the risk of a chemical release at this facility.  The Superintendent of Water Production has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements and is listed as the emergency contact person with EPA. In the event the emerge"

The program also provides for determination of the impact of significant accidental releases on the public health and environment and provides a history of such releases.  In accordance with RMP requirements our hazard assessment program will be reviewed and updated at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\nEPA regulations set the reportable release quantity for chlorine at 10 pounds.  Records dating back to 1973 indicate there has never been a reportable release from this facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nOur prevention program ensures that the elements of the risk management program are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the overall program and for each part of the program.  Our prevention program addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at our facility and the degree of complexity of our facility's operations.\n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation - Employee participation is a required element in process safety and risk management.  Employees are encouraged to serve on numerous task groups and teams to ensure that our RMP plan is current and in order.  All employees have ready access to all elements of our RMP plan.  All employees involved with operation of chlorination systems receive detailed training for all activities relating to the operation and maintenance of these systems.  New employees receive training prior to being allowed to operate any portion of the chlorination system.  Refresher training is provided annually.\n\n\n\nB.

We train each new employee involved with the chlorination process with an overview and the proper operating procedures for the process.  Refresher training is conducted annually and whenever a process change is made.\n\n\n\nC. Process Safety Information - written process safety information regarding chlorine, chlorination technology, and chlorination equipment was compiled to enable the employees involved in the operating process at our facility to identify and understand the potential hazards of chlorination processes.\n\n\n\nD. Process Hazard Analysis - Each process hazard analysis is performed by the Hazard Assessment Team, of which all members have expertise and knowledge specific to the chlorination process.  Review and updates of the process hazard analysis are conducted every 3 years.\n\n\n\nE. Mechanical Integrity - at this facility, all equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained in order to minimize the risk of a chlorine release.  The frequency of our mechanical inspections is in accordance with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and each test and/or inspection is documented.\n\n\n\nF. Operating Procedures - The standard operating procedures at this facility provide clear instructions for properly conducting all activities associated with the operation, inspection, and maintenance of the chlorination system.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually for content and accuracy.\n\n\n\nG. Management of Change - Prior to implementing a change in the chlorination process, the change is identified, reviewed, and authorized prior to implementation.  A Process Change Authorization is required for any changes to ensure the operating procedures contain the operating parameters and the importance of operating within the limits.  Management of change covers changes such as process technology changes and changes to equipmen"

Pre-startup Review - Prior to startup of a changed process or affected part of a process, all employees involved in operating the process, maintaining the process, and contract employees effected by a change are informed of and trained in the change(s).  Additionally, process safety information and operating procedures are updated to reflect the change(s) necessary.\n\n\n\nI. Contractors - Prior to starting any work on or adjacent to chlorination system equipment, contractors are required to provide detailed information regarding their safety and health program and safety performance record.  Contractors are then informed of all potential hazards they may be exposed to, emergency action plans in place, and required safe work practices.  They are also informed of their responsibilities to ensure that their employees receive the necessary training.  Periodic inspections of the contractor's performance are conducted to ensure safe work practices are being followed.  Documentation is maintained that all the listed requirements have been met.\n\n\n\nJ. Hot Work Permit - The hot work permits issued at our facility document that all fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the start of any hot work operations.  Each permit, which must be issued by the Superintendent of Water Production, identifies the date(s) authorized to perform the hot work and the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed, as well as site preparation and safety equipment requirements and documentation \n\n\n\nK. Incident Investigation - Incidents that result in or could have reasonably resulted in a chlorine release are investigated within 48 hours of the incident.  The incident Investigation Team investigates each incident in an attempt to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents.

Compliance Audits - The Hazard Assessment Team is responsible for assembling a compliance audit team to audit compliance with RMP at least every three (3) years.  The audit procedures include examinations of the written RMP plan and documentation, interviews with responsible personnel, and visual inspections of the site and equipment.  A check sheet is used as a guide to the elements to be considered.  A standardized audit form is used to document each audit step and to ensure an effective audit is conducted and proper follow-up is accomplished..\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOur emergency action plan addresses the actions that our employees are to take in the event an accidental chlorine release occurs.  Although our employees will not serve as emergency responders, they are fully responsible for determining that a chlorine release is occurring and for coordinating emergency response activities through the Aiken County Emergency Preparedness Division and the North Augusta Department of Public Safety.  Our emergency action plan clearly lists the steps employees must take upon determining a chlorine release has occurred.  Employee training in emergency action plan responsibilities, in addition to practice drills, is conducted annually.\n\n\n\nSafety and Mitigation Systems\n\n\n\nOur facility currently has chlorine leak detectors located in both the container storage and process areas.
