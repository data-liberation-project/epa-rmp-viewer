Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nMachinery Room\n\n(5) Screw compressors\n\n(5) Oil separators\n\n(1) Shell and tube oil cooler\n\n(3) Plate and shell oil coolers\n\n(1) Plate oil cooler\n\n(1) Glycol accumulator\n\n(1) Glycol chiller (plate heat exchanger)\n\n(2) Liquid transfer vessels\n\n(2) Main suction accumulators\n\n(1) Thermosyphon vessel\n\n(1) Auto-purger\n\n\n\nCondenser Area\n\n(3) Evaporative condensers\n\n(3) High pressure receivers\n\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\n\n(3) Ammonia diffusion tanks\n\n\n\nShipping Dock\n\n(3) Accumulators\n\n(5) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nHallway\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(3) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nRepack Room\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling-suspended)\n\n\n\nRoom 1\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, plate fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 2\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (bunker-mounted, plate fin)\n\n\n\nRoom 3\n\n(2) Accumulators\n\n(4) A"

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tanks if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThere is one ammonia detector installed inside the refriger"

Also, two separate sampling systems are installed monitoring each refrigerated room,  providing at least every fifteen-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe.\n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed on the north side of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to the diffusion tanks. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Grapeman (Lucich Farms) Bakersfield consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Grapeman (Lucich Farms) Bakersfield is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nGrapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\n\n \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \n\n\"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Grapeman Bakersfield Cold Storage LP will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
