The Facility Policy:  The owners, managment, and employees of Agri-Tech Service Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for the sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum quanity stored would be 160,000 pounds in one tank car.  The maximum quanity handled would be the unloading of the rail car holding 160,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the tank car released as a gas over a time period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures (or if applicable the quanity in rail car if greater).  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.22 miles.\n    The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2 inch transfer hose, with 11,908 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. "

      "SummaryText": " The Five-Year Accident History\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or enviromental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program:\n     The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n"
