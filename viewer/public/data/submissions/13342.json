      "SummaryText": "The Dade County Water Authority is presenting its Risk MAnagement Plan in accordance with EPA regulations.  The Risk Management Plan included in this submittal covers the toxic chemical Chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the final stages of the water treatment process prior to distribution to water customers.  The Authority has two one-ton cylinders of chlorine on-hand at one time at the facility.  One is connected to the chlorination equipment for use during the treatment process and the other cylinder is in storage waiting to be connected once the other cylinder is empty or if an operational failure should occur. Upon evaluation of the amount of chlorine on-hand and possible problems that could occur in relation to the use of chlorine, it has been determined that, in a worst-case scenerio, the distance of 0.9 miles would include possible off-site receptors.  It has also been determined that, in an alternate relase scenerio, the distance of 0.3 miles would include possible off-site receptors.  The cylinders are in an enclosed area which would aid in containment should an accidental release occur.  The prevention program that is in place for Dade County Water Authority involves safety information review and hazard review.  These two reviews include training of the plant employees in the safe operation and maintenance of the chlorination equipmentat and waht to do if certain hazards shouLd arise.  The treatment facility has had no chlorine related accidents within the last 5 years.  Since Dade County's treatment plant only employs 11 employees, they do not have an employee response emergency plan.  Their emergency plan is coordinated with the Tri-State Mutual Aid Association.  The Association is responsible for emergency response for any chlorine related accidents and notifying the public.  At this time, there are no plans to update safety procedures other than adding chlorine detectors in the chlorination chamber.  Dade County Water Authority is covered by Enhanced 911."
