These products require an environment, whereby the temperatures are maintained at less than \n\n50 degree Fahrenheit before, during and after processing.  Ammonia is the refrigerant used to maintain this environment to protect the meat products from microorganisms.  This ensures the food safety and quality of the products processed.\n\n\n\nPrevention program:\n\nCopies of the operating procedures relating to liquid AMMONIA system are in the TUR-PAK FOODS and COMPANIES PSM(TOS/SOP) MANUAL, located in the FSRC office.  These procedures address the hazards of AMMONIA and how to safely complete the task.  Specific subjects:\n\n            Initial startup\n\n\n\n            Normal operations\n\n\n\n            Temporary operations\n\n\n\n\n\n        Emergency shutdown and operations\n\n\n\n            Startup after an emergency shutdown\n\n\n\n            Normal shutdowns\n\n\n\n            Startup after a normal shutdown\n\n\n\nStartup after a change to the AMMONIA system that requires a hazard review\n\n            \n\nConsequences of a deviation and steps to correct or avoid the                              deviation\n\n\n\nEach employee operating and maintaining the AMMONIA system has a training file containing proof of initial training on the process by one of the two methods listed below.  These employees operate and provide maintenance for the AMMONIA system.  Maintenance conducted by TUR-PAK FOODS and COMPANIES employees consist of routine service, inspections startup and shutdown.  Repair and major maintenance activities are contracted to people with expertise in AMMONIA maintenance.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThis facilityA?s employees will not respond to an emergency release scenario of AMMONIA, which could have offsite consequences.  The Sioux City Fire Department has been informed of the storage of 17,400 pounds of AMMONIA and has a copy of this Risk Management Plan.

This is based on the receiver holding 50% of its capacity and from carryover during systems repairs.  This is based on using an idle Receiver #2 and increasing the ammonia storage in Receiver #1 an additional 25%.  This scenario is based on 7879 lbs. Released within 10 minutes under the worst conditions.  The distance that the toxic endpoint could travel is 0.80 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  It is the companyA?s administrative policy to limit the receiver #1 capacity at 50% or less capacity during normal operations.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nAll of the Alternative Release Scenarios had distance endpoint of 0.10 miles or less and therefore no offsite hazard to the public.\n\n\n\nPrevention Programs:\n\nTUR-PAK FOODS and COMPANIES are in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and this rule.\n\n\n\nFive year Accident History:\n\nThere have been 78 minor release, which were handled by the refrigeration engineer and one was reported, but was determined to be less than the requirement of 100 pounds released"
