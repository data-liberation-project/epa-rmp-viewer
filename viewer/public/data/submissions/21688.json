As it is Lucich Farms' policy to comply \nwith all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was \ndesigned and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Building and Uniform \nMechanical Codes.  Conformance with these code requirements ensures that the \nbuilding and refrigeration system meet specific design and installation \nrequirements that reduce the risk of accidental releases.  \n\nPersonnel from Lucich Farms monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration \nsystem.  All major service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration \nsystem are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing \nin ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform \nmajor service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in \nexcellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Lucich Farms' objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in \nall of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes \nemergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been \nprepared for Lucich Farms and a chain of command to respond to emergencies \nhas been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nLucich Farms owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 17808 Zerker \nRoad.  Shafter is the closest city to the Lucich Farms Cold Storage facility.  The \ncold storage facility was constructed in 2000 utilizing all new equipment at the \ntime of construction.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for \nthe Lucich Farms Cold Storage facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a \nsuction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, three compressors, two \nevaporative condense"

Roof mounted accumulators supply liquid ammonia to the \nflooded evaporators in the pre-cooler room, cold storage rooms, and the hallway, \nstaging and shipping areas.  Refrigerated glycol is circulated from the engine \nroom glycol chiller to the evaporator in the electrical room for space cooling. \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the \nrefrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire \nrefrigeration system can be \"pumped down\" to evacuate the ammonia from the \nsystem and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of \nammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is approximately \n21,000 pounds. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response \nplanning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary \nsource to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must \nanalyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  \nSince Lucich Farms' ammonia-based refrigeration system is considered a \nProgram 3 process, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite \nconsequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential \npopulation within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  \nThis area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the \nrelease would travel with concentrations at or above the endpoint.  The circle \nalso defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be \nidentified.  For purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP \nregulations define the toxic endpoint for anhy"

For liquefied \ngases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are \nassumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  \nHowever, this standardized worst case scenario was developed for emergency \nresponse agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the \nworst-case release scenario.  For Lucich Farms, the alternative release scenario \nwas selected based on the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the \nammonia-based refrigeration system.  A credible release event with a high \ndischarge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact.  A leak from a \nvalve packing was identified in the PHA as having a medium probability of \noccurrence with a discharge rate high enough to cause an offsite consequence, \nand therefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.    \n\nLucich Farms has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and \nalternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the release \nof 21,000 lbs. of ammonia over a 10 minutes period, the plume would travel 1.7 \nmiles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  Using 1990 Census data, the \npopulation potentially affected within the worst-case release scenario circle is 96 \npersons.  Due to the rural location of this facility, the population potentially \naffected by this worst case release may be substantially overstated by the 1990 \nCensus data.  There were no environmental receptors within the worst case \nrelease scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a packing leak from an isolation valve located \noutdoors was modeled as a release of liquefied ammonia stored under pressure.  \nFor a release of 12 lb/min of anhydrous ammonia, the model calc"
