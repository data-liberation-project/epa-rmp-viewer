The program is designed to be dynamic, changing with the facility as new process and procedures are implemented. Key to the program is the involvement of employees in maintaining the effectiveness of the system.\n\nThere have been no reportable ammonia releases in the past five years.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan includes provisions for:\n* Evacuation\n* Notification Procedures\n* Ammonia Release Procedures\n* First Response Procedures\n* Training Procedures\n\nWe have many exciting changes in store in the coming months and years. Our 48 system safety program is continuosly being improved to assure top saety performance. Additionally, we utilize a multitude of outside resources to suggest and implement improvements. Our emphais on safety appears to be very successful given the \"can do\" safety attitude of our team members."
