We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and the communities in which we do business.  In striving for responsible environmental, health & safety (EH&S) stewardship, AEP pledges to:\n*  Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety.\n*  Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances and statues as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n*  Continually measure, evaluate and improve our EH&S performance.\n*  Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Sweeny Cogeneration Facility (SCF), located in Old Ocean, TX, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity and steam.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, anhydrous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in one dedicated, specially designed storage tank.  The storage capacity of the tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  \n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\nAs required by the RMP rule, one worst case scenario (WCRS) must be reported for the site.  The ammonia tank has a total volume of 25,000 gallons, limited to 80% by administrative controls, (20,000 gallons, or 130,000 pounds).  Based on modeling results using the EPA\u00bfs RMP *Comp software, the WCRS was calculated as the very unlikely catastrophic failure of  the anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing 130,000 pounds.

      "SummaryText": "is, passive mitigation exists in the form of a dike around the tank, which limits the spread of ammonia.  Although not considered in the analysis (per 40 CFR 68), a water fogging system surrounds the storage tank. Based on the analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario.  It was analyzed as the failure of a 3-inch unloading hose failure at delivery truck unloading point.  The release would be mitigated via an excess flow valve on the delivery truck and by automatic shut off valves on the ammonia loading header.  A water deluge system installed around the outside of the tank would further mitigate any ammonia release, but was not considered in the release calculation.  The EPA's RMP*Comp software was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, public receptors would be affected by the alternative release scenario.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nSCF is subject to OSHA's PSM standard and Program 3 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at SCF includes:\n\nEmployee Participation\nAll SCF employees are actively encouraged to participate in the accidental release prevention program.  Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs.  Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis.  Employees have access to all information required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nSCF maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  PS"

Information concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, and  thermal and stability data.\n\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\n\nInformation concerning the process equipment includes the materials of construction, piping specifications, piping and instrument diagrams, relief design calculations and design basis, design codes and standards employed, safety systems.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nSCF has a comprehensive PHA program to ensure that  hazards associated with the ammonia process is systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that PHA recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nSCF maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified annually.  Safe work practices such as hot work, lockout and line breaking, are referenced in operating procedures, where applicable.\n\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of SCF are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process.

Because some contractors will work on or near the ammonia process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors are pre-qualified before performing work, aware of the hazards of the process, understand what to do in the event of an emergency, understand site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards they encounter during their work.  AEP also evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nSCF conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or significant facility modification.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety systems, procedures, training, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accidental release prevention programs are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSCF has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief  systems, controls, pumps and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the required specifications.  \n\nHot Work Permits\nSCF has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process s"

The changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls and safety systems are in place to manage any new hazards as well as to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  The system requires that process safety information and operating procedures are updated and that operations and maintenance personnel are trained before the change is implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nSCF promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the release of ammonia.  The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, are reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors). \n\nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, SCF conducts compliance audits every three years.  The facility quickly resolves any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\nAdditional Safety Systems\nSCF has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.
