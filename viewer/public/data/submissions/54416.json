This commitment is demonstrated by the  resources invested in accident prevention, such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.   If, in spite of all precautions, a  release does occur, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC's trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nNovolyte Performance Materials, LLC manufactures, processes and stores specialty chemicals in Zachary, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana and evaluated the facility to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded threshold quantities.  Based on process knowledge, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  The facility uses six regulated substances in five separate processes.  The chemicals and largest quantity on site (either as largest quantity in a single process or total quantity of mixtures) are: ethyl chloride (74,000 lbs); formaldehyde (60,000 lbs); methyl chloride (220,000 lbs); phosphorus tricloride (88,000 lbs); and 2-methylpropene (50,000 lbs.).\r\n\r\nIn addition, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC is subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code (2869).  Therefore, the five Ferro Baton Rouge processes are classified as Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances:      The endpoint for the worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 pound per square inch (psi) over pressure (i.e., 15"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):    Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure the adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nNovolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:     To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.   Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. \r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge have hazards specific to the individual chemicals that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  These are addressed through operating procedures for the BzPA, DXA, DXL, Glymes and the Multi-Purpose Units.   In addition to other measures, flammable materials (2-Methylpropene and others) are stored and used under nitrogen blanket to prevent mixing with air which could form flammable mixtures.    Toxic substances are stored under pressure (methyl chloride) and/or under nitrogen blanket at lower pressures to prevent atmospheric venting or introduction of air or moisture (phosphorus trichloride). \r\nNovolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNovolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release per 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n \r\nEmergenc"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation and accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, incident mitigation and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The plant routinely performs maintenance on emergency equipment including tests and inspections and provides employee training on equipment use.  Employees receive training as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or for changes in personnel.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for Novolyte Performance Materials, LLC Baton Rouge is coordinated with East Baton Rouge Parish emergency response officials and the Zachary Fire Department.   Periodic meetings with response agency personnel are conducted to discuss needs and concerns in the event of an incident at the plant.

The distances to the endpoint of 1 psi over pressure for the worst-case release of 2-methylpropene using the EPA lookup table is 0.27 miles.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:      Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Each of the three regulated toxic substances at Ferro Baton Rouge was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to endpoint.  Based on the EPA lookup tables, a worst-case release of methyl chloride results in a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 3 miles.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line.  Conditions considered for alternative release scenarios are: a release rate dependent upon scenario; use of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source; the actual release height; and consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances:     A single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical release scenario has been identified for ethyl chloride as follows.  A 2-inch nozzle on the ethyl chloride tank breaks off, allowing release of the contents into the tank dike.  The ethyl chloride will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion.   The distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint for the alternative-case release of ethyl chloride using the EPA lookup table is 0.20 miles.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:    One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.
