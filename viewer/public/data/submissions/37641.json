The CoT- WUD trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment. A chlorine gas detection system operates continuously in the areas where chlorine is stored or used for chlorination of water.\n In the event of an emergency, the CoT- WUD will contact the Tempe Fire Department to respond. A designated emergency contact for the plant initiates emergency notifications. All employees are trained in the proper procedures and their appropriate role in an emergency. The South Tempe Water Treatment Plant maintains a highly cooperative relationship with the Tempe Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of the chlorination system and emergen"

The STWTP supplies drinking water to residents and businesses in Tempe. Pressurized containers of liquid chlorine are stored and used at the plant. The gaseous chlorine is connected to the chlorine injection process so that small amounts of chlorine gas are added to the water as a disinfectant. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this process is 22131, Water Supply and Irrigation Systems. Chlorine is a dense, greenish-yellow gas with a pungent, irritating odor. Chlorine used at the plant is contained in metal vessels designed to Department of Transportation standards. The containers are stored and used in a concrete building with a chlorine gas detection system and a ventilation/scrubber system. The ventilation/scrubber system is designed to neutralize a release of chlorine gas should it occur. \n\nSummary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe CoT- WUD's release prevention program complies with Federal Accidental Release Prevention requirements for chlorine. The city of Tempe's prevention program emphasizes thorough training for its employees in hazard communication; proper handling, transfer, storage, and use methods; and awareness level emergency response. The CoT- WUD's standard operating procedures include diligent observation of the chlorine systems vessels, piping, valves, and other equipment. The chlorination system is designed and constructed in accordance with Chlorine Institute standards and Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for safety. Secondary containment designed to contain a liquid chlorine release is present in the chlorination building. A chlorine leak detection system monitors the inside and outside"

If a chlorine release is detected by the sensors, an audible and visual alarm will sound to initiate emergency response procedures and the ventilation/scrubber system is automatically activated. \n\nSummary of Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents or accidental releases involving the STWTP chlorine system in the last five years.\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\nThe CoT WUD's STWTP facility has a written Emergency Response Plan. The focus of the plan is to protect the public, employees, public property, and the STWTP facilities. The facility uses a continuous chlorine detection system to monitor for a release 24 hours a day. Immediately after discovering a release of chlorine, STWTP personnel are instructed to notify the Tempe Fire Department for initial response and evacuate the area affected by the release. The Tempe Fire Department will be the primary responder to a chlorine release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe CoT WUD's STWTP has an excellent safety record and is continually evaluating ways to improve safety at the site. STWTP operators and maintenance personnel are trained and updated in the hazards of chlorine and proper operation of the chlorine system.\nThe CoT WUD is currently working on an upgrade of the water disinfection procedure by instituting the use of on-site generated liquid sodium hypochlorite instead of gaseous chlorine. Ultimate removal of gaseous chlorine will improve the overall safety and reduce the hazards associated with chlorine handling and storage."
