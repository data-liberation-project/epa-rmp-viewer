Like our local community and industrial neighbors, U.S. Amines' fifty site employees want a clean, safe environment with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play. That is why U.S. Amines has a \"zero-incidents\" goal. The zero-incidents goal is a commitment to reducing emissions and having zero injuries and zero environmental incidents. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. Amines Bucks' Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in operations. The Lemoyne Community Advisory Panel was one of the first community advisory panels established in the United States. The Lemoyne Industrial Park companies have been recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation. This continued partnership ensures the community is a safe place now and in the future. \n\n\n\nU.S. Amines manufactures several different chemicals called alkyl amines. These alkyl amines go into the production of agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and pharmaceutical compounds. For example, the product isopropylamine is a combination of isopropyl alcohol and ammonia, and isopropylamine gets sold to other chemical facilities that produce herbicides. Regulated substances held at the stationary source, U.S. Amines, are as follows: toxic substances, ammonia, propionitrile, and cyclohexylamine; flammable substances, dimethylamine and isopropylamine. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program actions include, but are not limited to, transfer operations being visually monitored; tanks, valves, hoses, pumps, piping, and safety devices being properly maintained and kept in good operating condition; commercial carriers following correct procedures when unloading or loading and remaining with their equipment at all times. \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevent"

These are policies outlined in a manual available plant-wide.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific accidental release prevention program actions for regulated substances include dikes and pans. The ammonia storage tanks do not use dikes due to evaporation. Dimethylamine transfer from rail car to iso-container makes use of a pan draining to wastewater to prevent the accidental release of dimethylamine during transfer. Isopropylamine, cyclohexylamine, and propionitrile storage tanks do make use of dikes. All storage tanks of the chemicals are routinely inspected to maintain the mechanical integrity. Ammonia, dimethylamine, and isopropylamine are all readily soluble in water, which would help with mitigating an accidental release.\n\n\n\nIf there is an accidental release, the priority is to evaluate the safety of plant personnel and to determine if outside assistance is needed. Then, the containment procedures and incident reporting procedures are followed. If the substance is flammable, foam or other suitable substances are to be applied to the released substance to prevent ignition and aid in vapor control. All storm and sanitary drains are covered to prevent the released material from flowing offsite. The containment area is barricaded and secured to prevent entry and possible injury. A site-specific incident report is completed, and if needed, an incident report"

This includes procedures for notification and communication, categorizing emergencies, evacuations, mutual aid resources, incident management, site control, personnel protection and safety, decontamination, emergency medical care, hazardous material release, fire emergencies, rescue emergencies, off-site response, severe weather, and bomb threats. Pre-incident planning and post incident considerations are also included in the program. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program follows the Incident Management System for emergency operations and includes the training of all production personnel to be members of the Bucks Emergency Services Team (BEST). The training includes firefighting, hazardous materials response, confined space rescue, first aid and CPR. Mutual aid agreements with other local industrial sites and local fire and emergency response agencies complement the emergency response plan. The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills with local industrial facilities, local fire departments, and the county emergency response team, Mobile county EMA. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. Amines Bucks' plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through the consolidated Process Safety Management Program.
