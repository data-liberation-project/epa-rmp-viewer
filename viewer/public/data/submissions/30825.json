      "SummaryText": "Background Data\n\nEmpire Cheese and its parent company, Great Lakes Cheese, operate a facility in Cuba, NY which produces a variety of cheeses.  Milk, cream, and additives arrive in bulk from other locations.  The milk is fermented into various cheeses, processed, cooled, and packaged. After packaging, the product is stored in our refrigerated warehouse facility until shipped to the customer or for further processing (slicing, shredding, etc.).\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nEmpire Cheese is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system.  To further safety in our facility, the refrigeration system is constructed under permit from local authorities, such as the building and fire departments.  Additionally, we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we implement a method called Process Safety Management to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained safely.\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of our final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant. To achieve this, Empire Cheese uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112\u00ae regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.\n\nMost large refrigerated facilities use a chemical called anhydrous ammonia as a vital part of the refrigeration system.  Ammonia performs the same functions as the hydrochlorofluorocarbon - Freon refrigerants used in home air conditioners, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. Ammonia is the most environmentally f"

Anhydrous ammonia is also used widely as a fertilizer, both for direct injection into the ground and for manufacture of other fertilizers.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, it is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWe use a variety of methods to ensure that accidental releases of hazardous materials are prevented to the greatest extent possible.  In addition to professional design and installation to accepted engineering standards, our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\n\u00b7 Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\n\u00b7 Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system and some major modifications to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\u00b7 Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We use a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\u00b7 Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\u00b7 Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n\u00b7 Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n\u00b7 Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a"

Empire relies upon the efforts of community emergency response personnel to respond to any serious accident at the facility.  We support the efforts of the Cuba Fire Department and other Alleghany County emergency organizations by providing information and technical assistance.  Many members of the responding organizations are full-time employees at Empire Cheese.\n\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n\nThrough our Process Safety Management program, we systematically look for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility.  As changes are made or as process hazards analysis studies are updated, safety issues and improvements are identified and made as a matter of course.  Our adherence to accepted codes and standards drastically reduces the number of safety issues in a change; safety is designed in rather than added later."
