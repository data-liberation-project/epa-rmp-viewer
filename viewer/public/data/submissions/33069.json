Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the releases to people and the environment.\n\nThe Swift Lamb Company is a lamb slaughter and processing facility.  The plant is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as  a ?Complex Slaughter? facility.  Final products produced include: meat products, inedible grease and meat and bone meal.  The regulated substance used at this facility that meets threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a manufacturing aid in the refrigeration process.  Refrigeration is used in processing and storing of meat and meat products.  \n\nAll refrigeration maintenance personnel go through training on all the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP?s) from the Occupational Safety Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  These procedures are reviewed yearly to help insure that all problems are corrected.  The preventative maintenance program is periodically reviewed and updated as the monitoring and repair on equipment is performed.  This process has been of great benefit to the plant in finding problems in a timely manner.\n\nThe facility has developed a worst-case and alternative scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by the EPA.\n\nThere have been no releases at this facility in the past five years that have resulted in death, injuries, or property damage on site or in death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite.\n\nThe facility"
