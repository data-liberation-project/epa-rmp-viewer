The only composition change that occurs within the system are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks / unanticipated ammonia odors are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nContinued safety improvement for the ammonia refrigeration system is a top priority for Lomo Cold Storage.

These programs enable our facility to operate the refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the ammonia refrigeration system, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.\n\nFor example, routine daily inspections for all compressors include checking for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge readings, abnormal sounds / vibrations, oil pressure, operational parameters;  the condensers are inspected daily including water level, water distribution, pump + fan operation, water chemistry monitoring (pH, conductivity).  Weekly inspections are also conducted and documented that include receiver liquid levels, exhaust fans functional, any abnormal conditions (ex: ice buildup) in the cold storage zones, as well as verification of safety components (eye wash stations, exit routes clear, signage, etc.).  A routine semi-annual PM (inspections / testing / maintenance) is also conducted by a professional refrigeration contractor to verify function of safety design features, calibrate leak detectors, etc. \n\nThe Lomo Cold Storage ammonia refrigeration system has many safety design features including ammonia leak detectors, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, emergency stop controls, and an Emergency Refrigerant Control Box.  In addition, all pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to ensure the integrity of the vessel and associated piping is protected.\n\nMuch of the safety of the refrigeration system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.

To help coordinate the various elements of the program, a management system has been established that defines responsible parties throughout the facility for upkeep and implementation of each policy within the PSM / RMP program.  Compliance Audits are also conducted every 3 years that can identify potential gaps in compliance and recommend actions to achieve full compliance.\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the Region III Local Emergency Planning Committee (Sutter County Environmental Health) and Sutter County Fire Services (Live Oak Fire Station).

It is located just off of California Highway 99 approximately 4 miles south of Live Oak.  The facility includes multiple cold storage buildings with many rooms that are independently temperature controlled (ranging from 0\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F) as appropriate for various local agricultural products.  The facility offers 3.2 million cubic feet of total storage that enables the facility to meet seasonal demands and production overflows.\n\nThe industrial refrigeration system that services the cold storage rooms utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  An estimated maximum of 38,800 pounds of ammonia is used between two compressor rooms.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously based on operational + temperature demands.  The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to address system heat load demands during operation.  Two machinery rooms house the compressors, receivers, and accumulator vessels, and auxiliary components, while the condensers are located outside.  The evaporators and bunker coils that service the cold storage rooms are located throughout the facility at / near each room.\n\nAmmonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to move heat from product in the cold storage zones to the outside atmosphere.

Lomo Cold Storage is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at the Lomo Cold Storage facility in Live Oak, California.\n\nIt is Lomo Cold Storage\u0092s policy to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  To accomplish the company\u0092s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established safety programs that enable facility personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare facility personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\nLomo Cold Storage draws from several sources and decades of experience + expertise to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  Internal facility personnel with decades of experience, the resources of a professional refrigeration contractor, in addition to external risk management consultants all provide guidance to limit the risks of handling ammonia.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the facility\u0092s safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with Cal-OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, CCR Title 8 5189), EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68),"
