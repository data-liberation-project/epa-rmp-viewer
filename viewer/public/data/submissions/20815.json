The management and employees of the Middlesex facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, storage and distribution of acetylene.   Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of Calcium Carbide into water in a reactor vessel . A chemical reaction takes place and the acetylene is the compressed into cylinders containing an inert filler material and acetone. The acetylene dissolves into the acetone in the cylinder. Each cylinder is checked for weight of acetylene to insure that they have the proper amount of product. Cylinders are removed from the fill lines and placed into storage for shipment.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of a #8 cylinder containing 850 ft3 (58 lb) of acetylene. The results would be a maximum release of 58 lb. of  acetylene over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of  1 psi overpressurization from a Vapor Cloud Explosion was determined to be 0.03 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect no (0) residents and no special receptors. The only receptor affected is one business/industrial building. The results are based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from Land View III and actual observations.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was d"

(1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include one business/idustrial building and no residents and no public receptors or businesses. No Passive and Active Mitigation systems were considered.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process system. These  would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and Emergency Shut-off Valves , Flame Arrestors , vents, relief valves, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of acetylene.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process. \n \nWritten process safety information was developed for the acetylene system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of acetylene.

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in November 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews.

The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in January 1999.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on  January 17, 1999.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations. Equipment used to store, process, or handle acetylene has been designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize releases.  The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation.

This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind.  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.  Management of Change procedures were review in Febuary 1999.\n\nProcess incidents which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of acetylene are investigated, including near misses, within 48 hours of the incident.  The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mistakes.  Process incidents are investigated by a Team which include both management and employees and is multidisciplinary. An incident report is prepared following the investigation which includes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The Facility Manager is responsible for ensuring that all report recommendations are"

All resolutions are communicated to all affected employees. \n\nThe facility had one incident (accident) in the past 5 years which resulted in the injury of two employees. The accident occurred on August 30th, 1995 at approximatly 11 pm. The accident was caused by human error by disposing of approximatly 5 pounds Calcium Carbide in to a pit of Lime Water and the resulting reaction producing about 2 pounds of acetylene. The release of acetylene caused a fire and small explosion which injured the two employees with some 2nd & 3rd degree burns to the arms, face and neck of each individual. Some minor property damage (~$200) but no off-site injuries, damage or environmental damage occurred. The incident was reviewed and changes to operating procedures were established with training for all acetylene operators.\n\nThe facility has an emergency preparedness/response plan.  The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a release of acetylene.  The plan complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and has been coordinated with local emergency response agencies.  The facilities Emergency Response plan was review in November 1998 and tested in May 1999. \n\nThe facility receives a compliance audit in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every three years.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions, and practices to ensure compliance.  The Team uses an audit tool to document each audit step and ensure an effective audit is conducted.  A Protocol Policy has been developed to ensure that proper follow-up is accomplished.\n\nBOC Gases will make available all information, including any Trade Secret information as it relates to compliance with this regulation.   \n        \nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which has been integrated with the local commu"
