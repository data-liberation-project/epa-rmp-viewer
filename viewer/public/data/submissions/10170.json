Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen. The flammable mixture used to produce hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of following operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority, Tosco refinery emergency response team and activation of the Contra Costa County Community Warning System so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u0012s Risk Management Program regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen is used by our refinery customer to manufacture clean fuels.  Hydrocarbon based gases (including natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feedstock is then compressed and cracked in our reformer (furnace).  By"

      "SummaryText": "exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in adsorbers. The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to customer via pipeline. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable gas mixture. The maximum amount at this facility is:\n\n7 15,100 pounds of flammable gas containing approximately 11.5% hydrogen and 12.6% methane\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario, as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of flammable substances in the hydrogen process at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving a maximum inventory of a PSA vessel containing a flammable mixture.  A full PSA vessel inventory of 1,500 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint (1 psi overpressure) for this WCS reaches receptors off-site.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ACS)  for flammable substance at this facility is a flash fire resulting a crack in a 10 line between line between the boiler feed water heater and the boiler feed water make-up heater.  The entire inventory of the pipe and connecting vessels of 2,700 pounds of a flammable mixture is assumed to be released.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined flammable endpoint of 100% LFL (Low Flammability Limit) for this ACS reaches receptors off-site.\n\n4.

The facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility came on line in 1993. There have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u0012s emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u0012s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Contra Costa County Fire Department and the Tosco Refinery Emergency Response Team for fires related to the flammable process. Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures. \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
