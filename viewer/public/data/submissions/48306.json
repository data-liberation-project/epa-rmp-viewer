This facility is owned by UAP Distribution, Inc., having been purchased from Boettcher Enterprises, Inc.\n\nFor further information contact: Dale Buxman, ERS Area Manager, 5701 Eureka Bend, McKinney, TX 75070 (972) 489-3154, or; Bob Wesling, UAP Distribution, Inc. 424 East Elliot, Beloit, KS 67420 (785) 738-6617\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Distribution, Inc.,  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information - the anhydrous ammonia nurse tank parking and tank maintenance facility is located on the South side of East Elliott Street, just East of the offices and warehouse of UAP Distribution, Inc. at 424 East Elliott, Beloit, Kansas.  (785) 738-6617\n\n The primary activity at the facility is the repair and maintenance of ammonia nurse tanks used at various retail locations of UAP Distribution, Inc.., in Kansas and Nebraska.  In addition, maintenance is performed on fertilizer applicators, trucks, and other equipment in this facility.  In addition, filled tanks waiting for delivery or pickup for area customers are parked in this area.\n\nUnder the provisions for Predictive Filing, the number of ammonia nurse tanks may vary over the course of the year.  The estimated maximum number of nurse tanks is 62 -- 1000 gallon nurse trailers and up to 15-- 1500 gallon nurse trailers.  At the maximum of 85% of capacity, the total pounds of anhydrous ammonia present at any one time could be 373,490.      \n\nOperating procedures for maintenance of ammonia nurse traile"

Maintenance and inspections are performed using a check list of operating and safety equipment on the trailer plus an assessment of the overall condition of the trailer and tank, including paint.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the contents of one of the 1500 gallon nurse tanks,  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 6630 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank(s)  at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.31 miles according to the Degadis model, using an Urban terrain as the facility is located on the edge of the City of Beloit.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario is based on history on the most likely potential incident which is a release from a ruptured hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is also 0.31 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves which are being done to all trailers during scheduled maintenance.  Maintenance schedules are determined by color coding of the dust caps on the wheels of the nurse tanks with a full inspection and"

With knowledge of what colors have been used in the past, the year when general maintenance was last performed can be determined.  \n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n   \n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n The facility has:\n\na.  a written EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR1910.120; a copy of the plan has been provided to the local emergency planning authorities.\n\nb.  provided a copy of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to local authorities.\n\nc.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  At least annually,  evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe working and operating conditions.  Training is on-going and accomplished through a combination of in-company meetings, industry seminars, use of safety videos, and site-specific instructions and observations.  Local emergency response people have toured the facility and will be encouraged to do so on a regular basis at least every three years."
