These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nNewcold believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Newcold has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all applicable procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nNewcold works continuously to prevent any accident from occurring. Currently, there have been no reportable ammonia releases as this is a new facility.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nNewcold has implemented an emergency action plan in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The emergency action plan includes facility evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nContinued training, preventive maintenance, and program reviews are some of the steps that will"

Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the Lebanon, Indiana facility per EPA Regulation 40 CFR Part 68.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nNewcold is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the EPA\u2019s RMPComp internet-based program.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\nNewcold has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nNewcold currently maintains a record of written process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe methodology used to carry out the analysis is a What If Analysis Checklist.  The analyses are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular"
