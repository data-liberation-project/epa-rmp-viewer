A release of 2-Methylamine (CAS 74-89-5) occurred during the unloading of a tank truck to our facility storage tank.  Methylamine gas was released to the atmosphere and methylamine liquid was released to the area drainage system where a portion of the liquid vaporized to a gas. The scrubbing system designed to trap the vapors was flooded during the incident and was unable to contain the full release.   A total"

A second employee was also sent to the hospital for observation but was released after approximately one hour and returned to work the same day.  No other persons on-site or off-site were injured or affected and there was no property damage from this incident.  Additional details are provided in Section 6, Accident History.\n\n5.0  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe recent release of Methylamine at our facility has prompted us to take several measures to improve safety for all of our hazardous processes, including those that involve RMP regulated chemicals.  Improvements that are being evaluated, or have already been implemented include:\n  Revision of the Methylamine tank truck unload procedure to require use of breathing air.\n  Implementation of a project to simplify the Methylamine storage facility piping.\n  Review and updating of the emergency response procedures to ensure they reflect current \n     practices and contact information.\n  Plans for more plant drills on hazardous release response to increase awareness of, and\n     reinforce knowledge of the roles and responsibilities plant personnel have during emergency\n     response.  \n  Individual departments, such as the Environmental Team, may increase drills to improve their\n     knowledge of hazardous processes and the potential consequences involved.\n  Guide Sheets that summarize essential emergency response procedures will be made available to \n     help ensure that critical emergency response tasks are carried out and not overlooked."
