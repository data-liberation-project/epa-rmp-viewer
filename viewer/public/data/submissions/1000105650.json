Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\n6.

Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to completion through an appropriate action tracking system.\n\nIncident Investigation: No incident has occurred at this facility that meets the criteria for incident investigation according to the RMP rule. However, CRC would promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. Such an investigation would be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent future releases. Any incident investigation reports would be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation: CRC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule.\n\nContractors: CRC utilizes contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. CRC has a policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the surrounding processes. Contractors are also informed of procedures for emergency activities should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining: CRC has training programs in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes, as well as emergency activities. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years.\n\nMechanical Integrity: CRC carries out documented inspections, tests, and maintenance checks of process equipment to ensure adequate mechanical integrity. These activities are conducted by the Mechanical Integrity and Maintenance groups. Only qualified personnel are permitted to carry out inspections, tests, and maintenance activities on process equipment and systems such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps, compressors and electrical equipment. Equipment deficiencies identified by the inspection, test, and maintenance checks are tracked to closure through company maintenance and mechanical integrity management systems.\n\nManagement of Change: A Management of Change program is in place at CRC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and personnel. Personnel who are affected by a change are notified about or, if needed, trained on the change.\n\nPre-startup Reviews: Pre-start up safety reviews are conducted for new processes and modifications to existing processes.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source: California Resources Corporation (CRC) is strongly committed to employee and public safety, as well as sound environmental practices. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances: The CRC stationary source consists of a compressor station, a gas plant with NGL recovery, and NGL storage and loading. The RMP regulated substance at the stationary source is a flammable mixture.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: Our facility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the applicable accidental release prevention provisions of 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at CRC.\n\nProcess Safety Information: CRC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the hazards of the chemicals used in the processes, information regarding the technology of the process, and detailed equipment information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: CRC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the regulated substance are identified and appropriately managed. The primary methodologies used to conduct these analyses are Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) and Checklist studies. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner based on the relative risk of potential scenarios.\n\nOpe"
