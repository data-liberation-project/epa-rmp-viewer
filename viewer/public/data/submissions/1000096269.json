The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nBlanchard - Charlotte East Terminal in Charlotte, NC is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Blanchard believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Charlotte East Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Blanchard promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection along with RC 14001 process management program.

No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with liquefied petroleum gas, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling liquefied petroleum gas to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community along with the surrounding environment. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which liquefied petroleum gas is handled as well as the various safety/control devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, contractors, and haulers which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Charlotte East Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored (under pressure) in one (1) storage vessel. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the on-site gasoline truck-loading rack. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees Fahrenheit) fusible elements, fail safe control valves, vessel multi-port pressure relief valves, fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Charlotte East Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB.
