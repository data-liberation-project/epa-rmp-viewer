All applicable laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in our community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has two (2) 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, several nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, electrical panels, lighting, and safety equipment as part of their anhydrous operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two (2) release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case\" release and \"alternative\" release scenario.  The \"worst-case\" scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of one vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The \"alternative\" release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release involves a catastrophic failure of the largest tank, releasing the entire 78,795 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off-site consequences were calculated using \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\".  The \"worst-case\" scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with a F atmospheric stability class, with the distance to the endpoint being 2.13 miles.  It is estimated that 300 people would be affected by this release.\n\nThe \"alternative release\" scenario assumed a hose breaks and leaks 7,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA"

      "SummaryText": "recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a \"D\" atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using rural topography and \"TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers\" the toxic endpoint is .92 mile.  The population within that area is estimated to be 75 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.\n\nKaup Seed & Fertilizer, Inc. has several key elements in it's accident prevention plan:\n1.  The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations of the State of Nebraska as enforced by the State Fire Marshall.\n2.  Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training includes properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response.\n3.  The facility uses the 1999 ANSI Standards that include training for employees, customers, and complete fire drills with the local emergency response departments.\n4.  Use of good management practices as specified by industry standards and training aids.\n5.  Frequent site inspections by management and safety consultants.\n6.  Annual inspections by Nebraska State Fire Marshall's inspectors include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n7.  Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n\nChanges are made in the system when necessary, or when required by regulation change.  Periodic evaluations of the procedures help to determine whether or not a change in operations should be made to provide increased safety to the operators and to the community."
