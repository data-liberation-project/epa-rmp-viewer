Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Winco Foods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \r\n\r\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\r\n\r\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions of OAR 437-002-0041.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \r\n\r\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Winco distribution center is a facility used for temporarily storing and transporting materials to the individual Winco grocery stores.  Storage of perishable items requires the use of a refrigeration system.   This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 24,000 pounds of"

Offsite receptors were defined using Marplot and the 2010 U.S. census information.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\r\n\r\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWinco Foods complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \r\n\r\nWinco Foods\u00bfs written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, Emergency Action and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Winco Foods Facility Maintenance Manager. \r\n\r\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.

This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \r\n\r\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Winco Foods in the past five years.\r\n\r\n1.60 Emergency Action Program\r\n\r\nWinco Foods has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.

This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Woodburn Fire Department and the Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue HAZMAT Team.\r\n\r\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Winco Foods and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.
