Mercer Foods interprets this regulation as any release that poses a threat of injury to anyone.\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms in the Operations Binder.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\nAny release of more than 50 ppm shall result in immediately evacuating the area and Russell King is to be called if not on site.  Releases less 50 ppm shall result in immediately calling Russell King, if not on site, for instructions.\nQuick response program has been adopted for Mercer Foods employees complete this task.  \n\nThere are additional full time employees at this facility in addition to Russell King that have been trained to conduct inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis.  These employees have been also trained to perform tests on the ammonia system and do certain maintenance procedures such as changing filters, etc. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks.  This activity is the core of Mercer Foods prevention program.  \n\n2. Mercer Foods uses this facility to `freeze dry? a variety of fruit, vegetables and other products. The purpose throughout the implementation of these programs is to reduce the risk of ammonia exposure to employees, contractors, the public and the environment.  Ammonia is the chemical used at this facility.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant for `freeze dry? foods and cold storage.  The ammon"

Mercer Food?s Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by Mercer Foods is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey objectives of Mercer Foods Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2) Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Mercer Foods.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Mercer Foods certifies operators following completion of operator training and Mercer Food?s confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\nRoutine maintenance and inspection of the ammonia systems are conducted by Mercer Foods? employees on daily basis.  Apex Refrigeration also conduct inspections and service at Mercer Foods? direction.\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysi"

This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all Mercer Foods employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Mercer Food?s Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Mercer Foods has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Mercer Foods Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possible of a fire. \nApex Refrigeration, Inc was evaluated  and is now the contractor for refrigeration repairs at Mercer Foods.\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7) Verification of Mercer Food?s compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Mercer Foods personnel.  Mercer Foods has established a Management System procedure to addr"

There were no ammonia releases in the last 5 years that meet the standard of State or Federal regulations.  A  to date.\n\n6.  This facility has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Response Plan developed for this facility.  Detailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  All areas (zones) in this plant can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shut down valves and switches for the zone with the release.  If the zone shut down areas are within the ammonia release area at concentrations above 250 ppm, the entire ammonia will be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified and marked to indicate the order in which they should be turned off.  Photos, diagrams and instructions have been generated for this facility.\n\nThe Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include:\n    EPA?s Risk Management Plan\n    OSHA?s Emergency Action Plan\n    OSHA?s Process Safety Standard\n    EPA?s Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know\n    Business Plan (CA)\n    Contingency Plan (integrated into Business Plan)\n    CalARP (Calif. version of above cited regulations)\n\n7.    Product and community safety are primary concerns at this facility.  The prevention program has been updated as a result of recent additions (screw compressor and new air handlers) and recent PHA conducted at Mercer Foods.  Additional persons have been trained to perform the required daily inspections of the ammonia system at this facility as well as contractors performing routine eminence.
