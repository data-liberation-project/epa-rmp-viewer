      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency reponse policies at the stationary source:\n\nNufarm Amercias, Inc. (Nufarm) is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  Nufarm coordinates all of the emergency response activities with the Cook County LEPC and Chicago Heights Fire Department.\n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nNufarm manufactures water-based herbicides using dimethylamine (DMA) and ispropylamine (IPA).  The manufacturing process consists of one main process area where the herbicides are produced and designated DMA and IPA tanks.  The herbicide process is a batch process.  Both DMA and IPA are regulated flammable substances.  The DMA is stored as a 60% (by weight) aqueous solution.  The IPA is stored as a 70% IPA aqueous solution.  The maximum inventory of 60% DMA solution is 180,000 pounds and is 69,000 pounds for the 70% IPA solution. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario (WCRS) and Alternative Release Scenario (ARS):\n\nThe RMP Rule requires the development of scenarios for the accidental release of toxic and flammable substances.  USEPA's Offsite Consequences Anaylsis Guidance dated April 1999 was used to model the release scenarios.  Nufarm has included one WCRS and one ARS in their RM Plan as required by the RMP Rule.\n\nThe flammable WCRS for the Nufarm facility involves the instantaneous failure of the 30,000-gallon DMA storage tank.  100% of the DMA inside the tank is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits and the cloud is assumed to detonate.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  This scenario results in off-site impacts to residences, schools, and industrial areas.  An administrative control limits the tank capacity to 26,000 gallons.  No passive mitigation systems were considered for this scenario.  The endpoint distance for this scenario, 0.35 miles, was greater than the IPA"

      "SummaryText": " WCRS; therefore, the DMA WCRS was reported in RM Plan.\n\nThe flammable ARS for the Nufarm facility involves the failure of the IPA transfer line.  The release duration is estimated to be 10 minutes and result in the release of 550 gallons of IPA.  The released IPA is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits and the cloud is assumed to detonate with 3% of the flammable vapor in the cloud participating in the explosion.  This scenario is more likely to occur than the WCRS and results in offsite consequences.  No administrative controls or passive mitigation systems were considered for this scenario.  The endpoint distance for this scenario is 0.10 miles.  \n\nNufarm has implemented programs to comply with the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps as required by EPA.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nNufarm maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of the regulated substances, the technology of the processes, and the equipment in the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nNufarm has performed process hazard analyses for the DMA and IPA covered processes.  These PHAs comply with 40 CFR 68.67.  The Nufarm site utilizes the What-If methodology to identify the hazards of the processes, to consider consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls, and to evaluate safety and health effects of possible releases of regulated substances.   \n\nOperating Procedures:\nNufarm has written operating procedures that provide instruction for safely operating covered processes.  These operating procedures are available to employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed annually and modified when needed to accommodate operational and process changes.\n\nTraining:\nNufarm provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees who operate the processes.  Training documentation provides records of whe"

Maintenance employees receive training for maintenance activities.  Periodic inspection and testing are performed on process equipment and records are kept to document this inspection and testing.\n\nManagement of Change:\nNufarm has a written procedure to document and manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Employees are notified of and provided training for changes to the process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review:\nNufarm performs pre-statup safety reviews for changes in a process that require modification to process safety information.\n\nCompliance Audit:\nNufarm will evaluate compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 every three years.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nNufarm conducts an incident investigation for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nNufarm has a written employee participation plan that allows input from employees on the development and analysis of process safety management.  PHAs and all other RMP information are available to employees.\n\nHot Work Permit:\nNufarm has a procedure for the issuance of hot work permits for hot work done on covered processes.\n\nContractors:\nNufarm hires contractors to perform maintenance and various other activities at their facility.  Nufarm reviews contractors' safety performance and programs and informs contractors of known potential hazards related to working at their site.  Nufarm maintains a program to control the entrance, presence, and exit from covered process areas.  Contractor performance is evaluated annually.\n\n5-Year Accident History:\nOne accidental release has occurred at the Nufarm Chicago Heights, IL facility that qualifies for the 5-year accident history.

Nufarm relies on the Chicago Heights Fire Department for responding to DMA and IPA releases and fires.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nAt this time, no changes are planned to enhance the safety of the Nufarm facility.  However, an on-going commitment to implement changes when identified that will improve the safety of the employes and neighbors exists."
