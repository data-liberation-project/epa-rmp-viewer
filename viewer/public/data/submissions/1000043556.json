      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nCabot Corporation, Cab-O-Sil Division (Cabot) located in Tuscola, IL, has operated our 180 acre fumed silica manufacturing site since 1958.  Cabot is a global leader in the fumed silica industry.  Cabot currently employs 159 people in Tuscola, operating the facility 24-hours/day.  Cabot produces amorphous fumed silica.  Amorphous silica is a versatile material that is made up of extremely small, very pure particles.  These particles are utilized in a large number of end-products, including common household items, such as toothpaste, cake mixes, nail polish, adhesives, cosmetics, automobile finishes, inks, plastics, various types of rubber, and many other uses.  Some of the fumed silica products are approved as food additives for certain applications by the Food & Drug Administration, while others are used as strengthening agents or to control the flow of both powders and liquids.\n\n\n\nThe Cabot facility is subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements pursuant to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  The facility uses the following RMP toxic materials at the facility in quantities that exceed the thresholds set for each material:\n\n\n\nMaterial                Quantity\n\nMethyltrichlorosilane (MTCS)    Greater than 5,000 pounds\n\nDimethyldichlorosilane (DiMeDi)    Greater than 5,000 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nRMP CHEMICALS\n\n\n\nToxics\n\nMTCS is transported to the facility via rail-car.  The largest quantity of MTCS in a single rail-car is approximately 170,000-lbs.  Rail-cars are stored onsite until they are connected to the offloading equipment.  Once connected for offloading, the MTCS is then transferred to and stored in larger vessels as both a 100% concentration and at various mixtures with Silicon Tetrachloride (Siltet).  The largest quantity of MTCS in an onsite storage vessel is 2,500,000-lbs.  Administrative controls limit the total MTCS quantity to 2,500,000-lbs.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for MTCS assumes the loss of a single railcar"

      "SummaryText": " onto the ground below and adjacent to the storage location along the rail spur.  The ground is soil and crushed rock. Modeling this release, using the RMP-Comp model, results in a distance to the defined endpoint beyond the facility boundary.  Although a larger quantity of MTCS is stored in onsite vessels, these vessels would release into a containment dikes which provides passive mitigation by reducing release surface area.  Further reduction of the surface area is accomplished through the use of additional passive mitigation in the form of two layers of polyethylene plastic balls which cover approximately 97% of the surface area of a released liquid.  The impact radius from an onsite storage vessel release does not extend as far as does the impact radius from a rail-car release.  The rail car release worst-case scenario, incorporated in the 2014 re-submittal, impacted additional receptors from the previous worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nDiMeDi is transported to the facility via rail-car.  The largest quantity of DiMeDi in a single rail-car is approximately 180,000-lbs.  Once offloaded, DiMeDi is stored in a smaller, bullet tank located in a diked area, with a maximum stored quantity of 290,000 pounds.  The use of the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidelines for the worst-case release of a toxic liquid provided an equivalent impact for the release of 100% DiMeDi compared to a worst-case release of MTCS.\n\n\n\nMTCS for Production Storage and Process is conveyed through a series of transfer pumps through 3-inch diameter pipe.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario for MTCS is a pipe break at the discharge of the Prime Pot P4R.  The release duration is approximately ten minutes, by which time the emergency shutdown system would be activated and the release stopped.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario was estimated using the ALOHA model, results in a distance to the defined endpoint beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n\nMTCS stored onsite in a r"

      "SummaryText": "ail-car was also evaluated for a release through a relief valve in the tank dome.  The model scenario was a release of 5.3-lbs/min for 60 minutes. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using ALOHA, and does not impact any public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe DiMeDi for Production Storage and Process analysis for alternative release scenario was a pipe break along the transfer line.  The release duration was 30 minutes with a release rate of 0.3 GPM.  The distance to the endpoint was calculated using ALOHA, and does not impact any public receptors.\n\n\n\nDiMeDi stored onsite in a rail-car was also evaluated for a release through a relief valve in the tank dome.  The model scenario was a release of 4.4-lbs/min for 60 minutes. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using ALOHA, and does not impact any public receptors. \n\n \n\nRMP APPLICABILITY\n\n\n\nCabot is subject to Program 3 RMP requirements for toxics due to the following:\n\n\n\n* RMP substances in process above the RMP threshold quantities\n\n* Public receptors within the worst-case release endpoint (toxics)\n\n* Processes at the facility are covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements\n\n* Specifically-listed Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code:  2819\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving RMP chemicals at the Cabot facility within the last five years.  Cabot actively investigates all incidents, regardless of severity, to ensure not only environmental protection, but workplace, public, and employee safety.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is a separate document maintained by the Health and Safety Manager.\n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENT\n\n\n\nThe fumed metals manufacturing process requires that we use certain materials that are potentially harmful if not handled properly.  Their safe use at our Tuscola site is the highest priority of everyone at Cabot; there is no obligation we take more seriously.  Ca"
