      "SummaryText": "Ellwood Group Inc. (EGI) purchased the former National Forge Company (NFC) out of bankruptcy in January 2003. Following the acquisition of the NFC facility and property, EGI split the operation into two business entities by product lines. The new companies formed were Ellwood National Crankshaft Company (ENC) and Ellwood National Forge Company (ENF) with EGI as their parent corporation. ENC operates the large diesel locomotive and marine generator crankshaft manufacturing business and ENF the pipe mold, generator shaft and penetrator ordinance manufacturing business. NFC prior to acquisition by EGI was an employee owned, fully integrated manufacturer of specialty forged alloy steel products located in Irvine, PA which was purchased from the closely/family held private corporation that operated the facility since the 1920's. NFC had prepared and submitted a RMP to the EPA in accordance with the chemical accident prevention regulations in June 1999. Currently, the ENC/ENF plant core products are crankshafts used in larger diesel engines and pipe molds used as expendable tooling in the production of iron pipe for water transmission. The balance of production consists of other heavy industrial products that involve precision machining or proprietary boring/coring techniques. The plant site encompasses approximately 300 acres with 46 acres of developed property and 578,000 square feet under roof. The combined plant operations employ approximately 388 total personnel in manufacturing and administrative positions. The plant operates three shifts throughout the work week and conducts a one to two week plant maintenance shutdown annually in July. The maximum number of employees at the site is approximately 216 during the first, or daylight, shift.\n\nEmployee and community health and safety protection is a major policy of ENC/ENF and its management, as is environmental protection. ENC/ENF employs at least two full time professionals in health and safety and retains other consu"

The management and employees of ENC/ENF take pride in being ISO 9002 certified and the combined ENC/ENF plants are the recipient of multiple safety and environmental awards.\n\nA portion of the manufacturing operation at ENC includes the nitriding or surface hardening department that is the location of the RMP regulated substance storage - anhydrous ammonia - a toxic and buoyant gas - threshold quantity 10,000 pounds. In the nitriding department, crankshaft wear surfaces (bearing/throws) are heated in a nitrogen environment and nitrogen is absorbed in unmasked steel surfaces causing a case hardening to a prescribed depth based on temperature and exposure duration. The ammonia is stored in a single 18,500 gallon horizontal, welded, steel, ASME certified, pressure tank. Based on administrative controls/operating procedure, the maximum volume stored on site at any time is 13,800 gallons (70,000 lbs). For the nitriding cycle, ammonia is withdrawn from the tank, used to purge air from the furnace environment, thermally separated into elemental nitrogen and hydrogen, and fed to the furnace to establish the inert nitrogen environment. Periodically, hydrogen and some nitrogen is vented to the atmosphere during the nitriding cycle and replaced. At the conclusion of the cycle, ammonia is used to purge residual hydrogen and nitrogen from the furnace.\n\nAmmonia release scenarios considered in the ENC RMP are consistent with the USEPA 2004 General Guidance Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68). For both worst case and alternative release scenarios, RMP*COMP Version 1.07 was used to calculate the distances to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm). Both model scenarios were considered as releases in rural areas, utilized the default atmospheric s"

Passive mitigation-release in an enclosure/building is applicable in either scenario but was not used in the alternative release case. Active mitigation available at the site includes water sprinklers to absorb released ammonia and detectors/alarms/operator attention to contain/control a release. However, no active mitigation was utilized in either scenario. The worst case and alternative release rates used in the RMP analyses were 7000 lb/min (3850 lb/min-mitigated) and 4000 lb/min, respectively. The RMP*COMP calculated distance to the toxic endpoints for the worst and alternative release scenarios utilizing the noted inputs are 3.1 and 1.8 miles, respectively. The affected populations are estimated to be 1956 and 1246 for the worst case and alternative scenarios.\n\nNFC operation and safety plans, policies, and prevention procedures as well as planned maintenance (overall management) have been established to minimize potential for an accidental or catestrophic ammonia release. Specifically, the most significant system physical improvement has been the installation of a high pressure, magnetically coupled sight gage that allows accurate tank contents volume measurement/management. Ammonia ordering/delivery policy and unloading management by two plumbers (required) minimizes overfill potential and a delivery release respectively - the most likely release incidents.\n\nBased on NFC and ENC operating policy and procedures, no release accidents related to ammonia storage have occurred within the past five years. No personnel lost time incidents, injuries, physical plant damage or releases affecting the plant or off site have occurred. ENC has prepared and implemented a written Safety Procedure (plant document SAW-004) entitled,  Ammonia Emergency Response Plan, effective dated October 1, 2003 and a written Off Site Response Plan (last update March 20, 2003) to deal with ammonia releases.

The site response plan is registered with the Warren County LEPC and is periodically implemented as a full scale onsite drill. The last county wide ammonia disaster drill, including LEPC, local fire departments, EMS, etc., was conducted at ENC/ENF on October 3, 1998. ENC/ENF has multiple designated and trained emergency response personnel as part of their work force. Most recently (October 17, 2003), the emergency response team was updated/recertified by independent outside auditors as part of the ENC/ENF annual program.\n\nNFC and ENC/ENF has prepared and implemented additional plant-wide policies/plans, i.e., hot work permit program, however, has not completed the contractor safety program etc. as part of the continuous plant safety awareness and improvement program. ENC has planned to prepare and implement the Contractor Safety Program by 9/1/04. NFC and ENC have also implemented a program to reduce the use of ammonia used in the nitriding process/operation. The program as implemented provides a more efficient use of ammonia by reducing/eliminating certain purging in the nitriding cycle.  The operation was tested in full scale in 2000 and immediately implemented. Consequently, NFC and ENC has considered use of two smaller ammonia storage tanks or less of an ammonia inventory to decrease the impact of any release and RMP consequence; however, increased production has exceeded the efficiency improvement of the ammonia use reduction and consequently as much or more ammonia is being used currently at ENC.  Therefore, neither NFC nor ENC has reduced the ammonia storage quantity since 1999."
