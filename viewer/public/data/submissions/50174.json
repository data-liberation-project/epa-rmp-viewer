The Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department). \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is located at 1900 North Stone Canyon Road in Los Angeles, California. There are multiple chlorine feed points on the reservoir complex property to disinfect water in Upper and Lower Stone Canyon Reservoirs and to Upper Stone Canyon bypass pipeline. The treated waters are piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of west Los Angeles with potable water. The station consists of a chlorine storage courtyard, chlorine equipment room, storage room, and an electrical equipment room. The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules. The Upper Stone Canyon facility stores chlorine in a 25-ton bulk storage tank that is connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas. The 25-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also e"

However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Upper Stone Canyon facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from the bulk tank to supply pressurized chlorine gas to the chlorinators.  The bulk tank is equipped with a Midland actuator on the gas valve that will stop the flow of chlorine when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected by the chlorine detectors.  The chlorinators supply gaseous chlorine to each of the Upper, the bypass, and the Lower injection systems.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the chlorinators under vacuum to the injectors.  In the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a concentrated solution.  The chlorine solution discharged from the injector is diffused into the pipelines or the reservoir through multiple diffuser nozzles.\n\nThe Upper Stone Canyon Reservoir injection system has three injectors adjacent to the Upper Stone Canyon Reservoir.  One injector serves chlorination of the reservoir, another serves the reservoir outlet, and the third is a backup injector. The injection system has five chlorine solution lines, one serves the outlet line, and the other four serve the reservoir.\n\nThe bypass system has two injectors, two vacuum lines, two solution lines, and one injection point. One injector and one vacuum line are primary, while the others are backups. Either line can serve either injector.  The injection system can also chlorinate the 36\" line, which sometimes serves as the inlet flow to Lower Stone Canyon Reservoir.  The injectors and piping are housed in an above ground cabinet.\n\nThe Lower Stone Canyon Reservoir injection system has three injectors located in a vault adj"

Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  The DWP Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  EPA also requires facilities that have a reportable accident to revise section 6 of their RMPs to include information about the accident within six months of the accident's occurrence.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Upper Stone Canyon facility in June 2004.  In April 2007, a reportable accident occurred at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station. This RMP is a revision of the 2004 RMP.  The following information is provided in the revised RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAdditional details of the above items for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested"

The injection system has three chlorine solution lines; one serves the outlet line, with the other two serving the reservoir.\n\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks. The detectors draw samples in the chlorinator room and from outside near the bulk tank. The detectors signal an alarm by activating a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, as well as an audible alarm within the chlorination room and activating an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorine facilities, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.\n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms, which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n* Comprehensive safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n* Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n* Use of effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n* High"

DWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nHazard Review \n\nIn 1996, 1999, and 2004 hazard reviews were performed for the chlorination system.  A hazard review was again performed in November 2007 and will be updated again within a five-year period or prior to a major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed in November 2007 to further improve the chlorine safety, and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of these recommended actions.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nDWP has prepared written operating procedures for Upper Stone Canyon chlorination facility that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating"
