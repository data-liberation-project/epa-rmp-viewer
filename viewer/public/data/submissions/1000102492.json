      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy: \nTrident Seafoods Corporation Akutan, Alaska Shore Plant employs between 60 and 1150 people on a seasonal basis to process pollock, cod, halibut, herring, crab  and other species of Alaska seafood.  In our company's Mission Statement, \"The Safety and health of our employees are paramount.\" A culture of safety is fostered from the company founder throughout top management down to and including every worker in our plant. A management system has been developed to administer the Chemical Safety Plan for prevention of accidents, and accidental releases both within the facility and the surrounding area.  There is an Emergency Response Plan developed for both chemical and other emergencies.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: \nThe Pollock and Cod Plants have a combined amount of 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia that is used for chilling fish and surimi and the freezing and storage of processed seafood in our two main process buildings.  OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are used as guidance for the safety of Trident workers and protection of the nearby community.  \nThere are 14 sections in our PSM prevention program.  Employee Participation is the foundation and backbone of the program.  A Process Hazard Analysis is conducted and revalidated every 5 years.  A follow up report details recommendations.  Standard Operating Procedures are developed for the operation and maintenance of equipment and system operation.  These procedures are reviewed yearly.  Training occurs weekly in most months of the year.  An annual HAZWOPER training and drill occurs on a yearly basis.  The facility has Emergency Response and Planning organized detailing responsibilities and roles in emergency response.  Critical equipment and contact telephone numbers are included and updated in this section.  Incident Investigation chronicles ammonia incidents and near misses in the plan"
