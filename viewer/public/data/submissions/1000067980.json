This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nBrief description of the stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant is located on 280 acres and is one of the world's largest PO/TBA facilities. Our facility produces many products that include propylene oxide, tertiary butyl alcohol, propylene glycols, propylene glycol ethers, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. We manufacture or utilize 5 regulated substance:  Propylene [1-Propene], Propylene Oxide [Oxirane, methyl-], Propane, Isobutane (Propane, 2-methyl), 2-Methylpropene (1-Propene, 2 methyl). \n\n\n\nBrief description of the general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant maintains a record of written safety"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Lyondell - Bayport Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive in-depth training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided as needed, but at a minimum of every three years. The training program is periodically reviewed to implement improvements. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure process equipment is functioning properly. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
