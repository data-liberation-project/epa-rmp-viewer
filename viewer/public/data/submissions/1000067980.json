This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nBrief description of the stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant is located on 280 acres and is one of the world's largest PO/TBA facilities. Our facility produces many products that include propylene oxide, tertiary butyl alcohol, propylene glycols, propylene glycol ethers, and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. We manufacture or utilize 5 regulated substance:  Propylene [1-Propene], Propylene Oxide [Oxirane, methyl-], Propane, Isobutane (Propane, 2-methyl), 2-Methylpropene (1-Propene, 2 methyl). \n\n\n\nBrief description of the general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict engineering standards and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant maintains a record of written safety"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is referred to as a unit Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis, but at a minimum every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting operations activities, Lyondell - Bayport Plant maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive in-depth training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided as needed, but at a minimum of every three years. The training program is periodically reviewed to implement improvements. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant carries out documented maintenance checks to ensure process equipment is functioning properly. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among other; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance is carr"

Changes are reviewed by plant staff prior to implementing. Process operators, maintenance\n\npersonnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained on the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are\n\nconducted as a regular practice. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into\n\noperation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken prompt manner. Audits are conducted by company subject matter experts.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nLyondell - Bayport Plant investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a catastrophic release of a hazardous material. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as many corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring. The investigation team can have members from different disciplines.

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule, particularly information resulting from process hazard analysis. Employees have the opportunity to participate on investigation teams, safety teams, and audit teams among other avenues. The Bayport plant has attained the highest level of recognition in the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), the OSHA STAR. As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Lyondell - Bayport Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nBrief description of the five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no releases of any RMP regulated hazardous chemicals at our facility in the past five years that meet the EPA RMP reporting requirements.\n\n\n\nBrief description of the emergency response program:\n\nThe Lyondell - Bayport Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to minimize the effects of any unforeseen accidental releases of hazardous materials.
