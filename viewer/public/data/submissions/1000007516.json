EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (40 CFR 68.155)\n\nThe Executive Summary is a brief description of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Helena will submit the Executive Summary to a central point as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prior to June 17, 2009.\n\n1.1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\nThe facility complies with OSHAA?s 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facilityA?s policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Helena Chemical CompanyA?s policy to notify the Finney County Fire Department or the Finney County SheriffA?s Office.  Helena's Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.   \n\n1.2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company A? Garden City, Kansas Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, receives, stores, and distributes anhydrous ammonia for direct application and blending for mixed-grade fertilizers used for crop production nutrients.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 187,770 pounds, stored in a 30,000 gallon bulk storage vessel and every 6 to 8 months, a T-Reactor mobilizes to the Facility and reacts anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid.  The T-Reactor is capable of storing 42,675 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\nThe facility complies with EPAA?s chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained "

Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\nHelena maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  Helena inspects the 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessel, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps on a monthly basis, and documents the inspection results.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n1.3.2. Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, Helena maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n1.3.3. Training\n\nHelena has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually and more frequently as needed.  In addition, employees not operating the anhydrous ammonia process are involved in safety training on the hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.3.4. Mechanical Integrity\n\nHelena performs document"

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nWhen outside contractors are required for maintenance and construction activities, those personnel are accompanied by Helena employees or are briefed by the area supervisor on the rules, regulations, and emergency procedures outlined in the Emergency Action Plan before initiating work.  Contractors use hot work permits, confined space permits, comply with lockout procedures, and use appropriate personal protective equipment when needed.  Contractors are briefed on the emergency alarm procedures and emergency rendezvous point.  Contractors must sign the visitor log.  The supervisor debriefs the contractor after each day.\n\n1.3.5. Compliance Audits\n\nHelena conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions of the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are performed at least every 3 years as required by 40 CFR 68.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n1.3.6. Incident Investigation\n\nHelena promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  The anhydrous ammonia spill release reporting procedures are found in the Emergency Action Plan spill procedures.  Report forms that will be completed in the event of an incident or possible incident are found in the Emergency Action Plan and the RMP.\n\n1.3.7.

In addition, Helena employees have access to information created as part of the Facility's implementation of the RMP.\n\n1.4. Five-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\nAn accidental release of anhydrous ammonia resulting in death, injuries, significant property damage, sheltering in place, or causing environmental damage on-site or off-site has not occurred within the past five years.\n\n1.5. Emergency Response Plan (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facilityA?s policy to notify the Finney County Emergency Management Agency and request that they respond to the emergency.  The facility has discussed this policy with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Helena's Garden City Facility has an Emergency Response Plan which is called their Emergency Action Plan.  The Emergency Action Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of an anhydrous ammonia accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia accident, first aid procedures for anhydrous ammonia exposure, and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Action Plan.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the local fire department, Finney County Emergency Coordinator and sheriff.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on the site are included in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n1.6.
