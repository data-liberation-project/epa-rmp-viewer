Managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are\n                    governed by.  The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials.\n\n               2.  Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and various safety devices, which\n                    are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of an accidental release.\n\n               3.  Key employees have been trained to isolate areas within the refrigeration system, which may become hazardous.\n\n               4.  These employees have attended the 24 hr. Emergency Response Training in Ammonia Refrigeration and will \n                    attend the eight (8) hour refresher course annually.\n\n               5.
