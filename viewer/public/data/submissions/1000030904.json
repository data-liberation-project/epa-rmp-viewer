      "SummaryText": "Saputo Cheese USA Inc. has developed, implemented and updated its Risk Management Program (RMP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) in accordance with the standards of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Part 68) and Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) (29 CFR 1910.119).  All elements of these standards have been combined to create one program document herein referred to as the \"RMP PSM\".  \n\n\n\nAPLLICABILITY:  The refrigeration system at this facility is subject to the RMP and PSM requirements since the system charge exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per 29 CFR 1910.119(a) and 40 CFR 68.10.  The boundaries of the covered process are defined by the components of the refrigeration system and include interfaces with other media (brine, glycol, and utilities) where the potential for an accidental release exists.  \n\n\n\nSaputo's RMP is comprised of the following sections which are summarized below.\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n2.    Stationary source and the regulated substances handled\n\n3.    Worst-case and alternative release scenarios\n\n4.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\n\n5.    Five-year accident history\n\n6.    Emergency response program\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSaputo is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our employees are trained to follow the Emergency Action Plan and to evacuate the facility as necessary.  We are also coordinated with and"

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses cheese manufacturing.  The plant is located at 317 Rosera Street, Lena, Wisconsin.  The area is zoned for industrial use. This facility processes milk into cheeses and packages the cheeses.  The cheeses are then distributed to wholesale and retail units.  There is one RMP-regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, used at the plant to provide refrigeration for production and warehousing.  The inventory of ammonia at our facility is 25,940 pounds.\n\n\n\n \n\n3.  WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is defined as the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  For the WCS, the high pressure receiver, containing a maximum inventory of 11,685 pounds and limited by administrative controls (written procedures), was assumed to have released its contents over a 10-minute period.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  For the ARS, chosen from the Process Hazard Analysis, a leak in a high pressure liquid line would result in a release of ammonia outdoors.  To limit the duration of the release, plant personnel would use controls and mitigation system within 10 minutes of leak detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nSaputo maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to e"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a combination of the HAZOP study and the What-If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years or when changes dictate.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nSaputo maintains written standard operating procedures (SOP) for covered processes.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround for each system component.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nSaputo ensures that operators are trained and understand the SOPs associated with the processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every three years and more frequently as needed.  The employees are also trained in the Emergency Action Plan annually.  All training is to be validated and documented for each employee.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nSaputo performs documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is performed by qualified personnel, either in-house or by a contractor, who have the appropriate training suited to their responsibilities.  Any identified equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose dut"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nThese audits are carried out once every three (3) years to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nSaputo promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release.  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a future release.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nSaputo truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nSaputo hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.  Saputo has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance "

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no incidents, as defined by the RMP rule, have occurred in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nSaputo developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency actions including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our personal protective equipment and ammonia detection system are regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the EAP is reviewed and updated as needed to reflect any pertinent changes taking place.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Recommendations resulting from the PHA and the Compliance Audit will be addressed in a timely manner."
