The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the Sabra Dipping Company is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the Sabra Dipping Company\u0092s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the Sabra Dipping Company is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Sabra Dipping Company refrigeration system. \n\n3.

A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Safe Work Practices\n- Employee and Operator Training Programs\n- Mechanical Integrity Program\n- Management of Change Procedures\n- PSM Compliance Audit Procedures\n- Incident Investigation Procedures\n- Employee Participation Program\n- Hot Work Permit Procedures\n- Contractor Safety Program\n- Emergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\n- Administrative controls\n- Operator Training\n- Computerized controls\n\nThe Preventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system\u0092s mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\nThere have been no incidents or accidents at the facility that meet the threshold for reporting for to the EPA in the past five (5) years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the Sabra Dipping Company is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6.

      "SummaryText": "in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. Sabra Dipping Company has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The Sabra Dipping Company conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe Sabra Dipping Company is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the Sabra Dipping Company to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Sabra Dipping Company employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\nAdditional Notes:  This Risk Management Plan includes both the \u0093Boaz\u0094 and \u0093Obed\u0094 ammonia refrigeration systems.  The sum of the estimated ammonia charge is the totals for each system\u0092s calculated combined maximum intended inventory, 22,000lbs."
