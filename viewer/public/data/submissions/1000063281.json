Dixie is a global supplier of specialty chemicals in three key market segments:\n\n\n\n          Thermoset Materials\n\n          Fuel and Lube Additives\n\n          Alkaline Paper Sizing\n\n\n\nDixie's core chemistry expertise is in functionalizing synthetic and renewable materials through epoxidation, hydrogenation, acrylation, and reactions with maleic anhydride, butadiene, propyleneimine (aziridine), and epichlorohydrin.  Dixie is the only global manufacturer offering a complete line of derivatives based on Diels-Alder and Ene reactions.\n\n\n\nContract chemical processing is also a vital part of Dixie Chemical's operations.  Dixie performs sophisticated custom processing under contracts with other chemical manufacturing companies.  Key features of the facility include:\n\n\n\n          Small to large scale equipment versatility\n\n          Multi-step synthesis capability\n\n          Multi-purpose batch manufacturing\n\n          High efficiency Biazzi hydrogenation\n\n          Thin film evaporation\n\n          Multi-tray distillation\n\n          Crystallization and solids handling capability\n\n          cGMP Protocol capabilities\n\n\n\nDixie utilizes seven chemicals in quantities that require inclusion in this Risk Management Plan: \n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals: epichlorohydrin, propyleneimine, formaldehyde (37%), and hydrochloric acid (37%)\n\nFlammable chemicals: isoprene, 1,3 butadiene, and Dimethylamine (60% aqueous)\n\n\n\nOf these chemicals, only propyleneimine is manufactured at Dixie's Bayport Facility.  It is sold as a product and is also used as a raw material in another process.  All other RMP chemicals are used as raw materials.\n\n\n\nEach chemical that is subject to RMP regulations is stored in a dedicated storage tank that is located within a containment area sufficient to contain the volume of the "

Most of Dixie's manufacturing efforts are scheduled in campaigns as opposed to continuous processes.  The inventories of the raw material chemicals are kept at a minimum between campaigns, thus reducing the risk associated with these chemicals.\n\n\n\nA typical manufacturing operation involves storage of the raw materials in tanks, tanker trailers, or drums; reaction of the raw materials; purification; and packaging of selected product.  Inventories of raw materials, intermediates, and final products are kept at minimum levels to reduce risk.\n\n\n\nWorst and alternative scenarios for were calculated for all RMP chemicals used at the Dixie facility.\n\n\n\nIn worst case scenario: RMP chemicals that are stored in tanker trailers were assumed to release the entire load. RMP Chemicals that are stored in tanks were assumed to release 90% of the entire tank volume to secondary containment. Dixie's policy is to maintain all tank levels below 90% at all times. Alternative case scenarios were calculated based on smaller releases caused by hose failures, loss of an entire reactor charge, etc.  All scenarios were calculated using RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nDixie Chemical Company is committed to continuous improvement of Environmental, Health, Safety, Security and Quality performance as well as compliance with applicable legal and industry requirements.  Dixie utilizes an integrated management system, ISRS 8th edition (International Sustainability Rating System) by DNV GL. Dixie holds a Level 7 certification from DNV GL. ISRS 8th edition is a world-leading system used to assess, improve and demonstrate the health of an organization's business processes. The system takes a Plan, DO, Check, Act approach to management systems. ISRS describes best practices in safety and sustainability management.

In addition to external audits, Dixie also performs multiple interal audits throughout each year. The audits are determined based on a scheduled frequency and could include environmental management, PSM & RMP programs, tasks involving highly hazardous chemicals, maintenance systems, mechanical integrity, safety systems, etc. All audit results are reported through our management systems review meetings.\n\n\n\nAll plant operating personnel are required to have classroom instruction as well as equipment specific training prior to being able to work independently in any of the manufacturing areas.

Dixie maintains a rigorous Management of Change (MOC) program to ensure that all changes are properly documented and implemented.  All employees receive training on the MOC and PSSR programs and procedures.\n\n\n\nPrompt and detailed investigations are performed to determine the root cause and to prevent recurrence of every safety, environmental, process, and other incident.  All records are maintained in a customized software package called Dakota Proactivity Suite.  Types of data managed in Dakota include spills, releases, injuries, near misses, MOCs, and internal & external audits.\n\n\n\nDixie Chemical has a fully trained and functional Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting primarily of volunteers from operations and maintenance.  Members of the ERT work on rotating shifts so that immediate help is available should an accident, spill, or other emergency occur.  All ERT personnel receive training as specified by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.156, and the National Fire Protection Association standards.  All ERT personnel receive extensive training and participate in drills designed to certify their current level of readiness.  Drills are evaluated to verify proficiency and to identify areas of improvement. On average, each member receives approximately 100 hours of ERT training annually.\n\n\n\nA plant alarm is in place to alert all plant personnel to any emergencies and Dixie subscribes to an internet-based incident reporting system called e-Notify.
