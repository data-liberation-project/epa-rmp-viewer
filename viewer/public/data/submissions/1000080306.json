      "SummaryText": "Introduction and General Information\n\nDanisco USA, Inc. (Danisco) owns and operates a hydrogenation facility located three miles north of Thomson, IL. It produces hydrogenated sugars (Xylitol and Lactitol) for commercial and industrial uses. The facility stores one chemical in excess of the threshold quantities listed in the US EPA Accidental Release Protection Regulations in the Clean Air Act Section 112&reg; (RMP). The facility is located at latitude 42.002500 and longitude -090.110833, in a rural setting in Carroll County, Illinois. The terrain in the local vicinity is flat to gently rolling land surface in a rural agricultural setting. The Mississippi River is located approximately one mile west of the facility, and the land use in that direction is agricultural. To the east, the land use is also agricultural, and the land to the south immediately abutting the facility is also agricultural, but approximately three miles south of the facility is the village of Thomson, IL. The land to the north of the facility is also agricultural lands, and the city of Savanna, IL is approximately seven miles north.\n\nAccording to the 1992 data for the Quad Cities Airport in Moline, IL, (nearest data source), the prevailing wind in the vicinity comes out of the south to northwest (approximately 180o to 330o). The average wind speed is 7.21 Knots (8.29 miles per hour). The stronger winds come out of 300o to 330o with velocities of as much as 17 to 21 Knots, and on limited occasions (<1%) the wind velocities exceed 21 Knots. The quadrant from 180o to 270o provides the majority of the winds. They are less intense (11 to 16 Knots maximum) but represent approximately 35% of the windy days. Winds are calm approximately 12.3% of the time. This data is based on 24 hours a day, 365 days per year for the year 1992. In computing and modeling the worst case scenarios the atmospheric stability class was set to \"F\" and the wind speed was set at 1.5 meters per second in accordance with the US E"

This was necessary due to the lack of the most recent three-year meteorological data. \n\n\n\nAir Products Storage Tanks\n\nAir Products owns,operates and maintains the hydrogen system and storage tanks located at the Danisco USA Inc facility located in Thomson,Illinois. \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no off-site consequences involving regulated processes or regulated chemicals at the facility.  There is no five-year accident history involving either regulated processes or regulated chemicals that involve significant property damage, personal injury or death.\n\n\n\nEmergency Assistance\n\nEmergency assistance is provided by the Thomson, IL Fire Protection District with mutual aid assistance agreements with Savanna, IL, and Mount Carroll, IL Fire Departments.  Savanna is located approximately 7.0 miles north of the facility and Mount Carroll is located approximately 9.0 miles east of Savanna, for a total response distance of 16.0 miles.  Mutual aid response times are approximately 30 minutes from the initiation of notice.  There is a Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for Carroll County, IL. And is located in Mount Carroll, IL.  Although this organization is formed, it is not active and does not provide emergency response or coordination services at this time.  Danisco has trained personnel in emergency response and emergency operations.  Each supervisor is trained to coordinate the response, assigning duties to personnel working in the area via the plant emergency notification system.  Additional support is provided through cooperation with the outside agencies once they arrive on site.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDanisco maintains all of the safety information required by RMP.  This includes Safety Data Sheets SDS), maximum intended inventories of regulated chemicals, safe upper and lower"

The facility has been designed by industry-accepted standards and good engineering practices.  Updates to the safety information will be made through the management of change procedures.\n\n\n\nHazard Reviews and Process Hazard Analyses\n\nDanisco performs hazard reviews or process hazard analyses (as appropriate) on all systems and has a program to address any deficiencies noted during the review.  These reviews are performed by facility personnel that are thoroughly familiar with the processes, using generally accepted procedures.  Reviews are repeated at least every five years.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAll operations at the facility are conducted using standard operating procedures by staff that is thoroughly trained on system operations.  The operating procedures cover steps for all aspects of the operation to include:  initial startup, normal operation, temporary operation, emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shutdown.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nDanisco provides all personnel with appropriate training to include initial and annual refresher training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMaintenance is accomplished by a computerized work order system to assure that preventative and corrective maintenance is performed by the required dates.  All maintenance personnel are trained to perform the various functions required by the work orders.  All process equipment is inspected in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices consistent with industry standards.  There is a program to address noted maintenance deficiencies.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe facility has a management of change policy that requires a review of all proposed changes except for replacement in kind.  Management of change requires that those employees affected by the change be informed of and receive training in the change prior to startup.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review\n\nThe facility performs pre-startup reviews and provide"
