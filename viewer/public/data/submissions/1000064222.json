Hocking manufacturers liquid fertilizer utilizing anhydrous ammonia and various other chemicals. This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The Hocking facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, above the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nHocking is committed to protecting the environment and operating its facility in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, Hocking has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of hazardous materials. \n\n\n\nThe facility relies on outside services, LEPC, Fire, and Police to respond to major release events. Hocking has coordinated with the local Fire Department.  They have a 3-minute response time to the facility and the facility is coordinating for future drills to take place between Fire Department and Hocking personnel.  The notification to the fire department can come either from Hocking, a concerned citizen, or from the facility's internal alarm system that is monitored 24/7.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility is located on 36-acres near the southern boarder of Pipestone, Minnesota. Hocking manu"

Hocking stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, above the threshold quantity. \n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nHocking is subject to and has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. The facility complies with PSM for the management of anhydrous ammonia. Hocking performs regular maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. \n\n\n\nThe covered processes at the facility include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The RMP Program elements apply to the anhydrous ammonia process.  Program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. In addition to the RMP program, the Facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release. The facility has sensors in place to monitor for elevated levels of ammonia in the atmosphere both on the production floor and at the anhydrous storage tank. Hocking has spill containment in place for out storage tanks located inside and have implanted all required safety features for our outside tank.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental release with on-site or off-site consequences meeting EPA criteria for inclusion inn this plan since the facility began operations. \n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nHocking is included in the community emergency response plan. The facility's response activities will be coordinated with the Pipestone County Fire Department.
