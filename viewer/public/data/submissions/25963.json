Bayway Chemical Plant\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Infineum USA L.P.Bayway Chemical Plant has had a long-\r\nstanding commitment to protecting their employees, the public,\r\nand the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the\r\nresources invested in accident prevention such as: providing\r\ncomprehensive initial and refresher personnel training,\r\nconsidering safety in the design, installation, operation,\r\ninspection, and maintenance of our processes, and conducting\r\ndrills to respond to simulated emergencies. Our objective is to\r\nimplement controls to minimize the potential for releases.\r\nHowever, if a release occurs, our trained personnel will respond\r\nto control, contain, and mitigate the leak.\r\n\r\nWe prevent accidents using a structured safety management system\r\nentitled OIMPS, Operations Integrity Management PracticeS, and a\r\nTotal Safety Culture in which all employees play a role in the\r\nprevention of incidents. Our Operations Integrity Management\r\nSystems are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our\r\nsafety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a\r\ncontinuous state of improvement, usually through many small\r\nimprovement steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from\r\nour hazard reviews and any incident investigations.\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Chemical Plant has been recognized by the Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a VPP STAR Facility\r\n(Voluntary Protection Program - Safety Through Accountability and\r\nRecognition) for its effective safety and health management\r\nprograms.

In addition we have hydrogen sulfide\r\nand sulfur monochloride that are regulated substances under the\r\nNew Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario defined by the EPA for the toxic\r\nsubstances used at the plant is a release of a 90 ton railroad\r\ntank car of chlorine.

Contractors are required to utilize the same\r\nprocedures to perform work as Infineum employees. These\r\nprocedures are documented in the Safety, Health and Environmental\r\n(SHE) manual.  Contractor administration procedures are\r\ndeveloped, coordinated, and implemented by the Plant's Contractor\r\nAdministration Team (CAT) made up of representatives from Safety,\r\nTraining, Maintenance, Projects, Operations, Purchasing, and\r\nrepresentatives from the contractor's workforce.\r\n\r\nContractor Administration begins with the Contractor Selection\r\nProcedure. The procedure includes an annual qualification of\r\ncontractors by the CAT that allows specific contractors to be\r\nconsidered for work.  This process includes a review of the\r\nContractor's Safety Program as well as the Contractor's safety\r\nperformance.  The review team also evaluates the Contractor's\r\npast performance in meeting training requirements, the\r\neffectiveness of their ongoing program to promote SHE awareness,\r\nand general feedback on work performance including input from the\r\nBayway Safety Survey system.\r\n\r\nIt has been the practice at Bayway to use union trained labor\r\nwhere craft skills are required.  Selected Contractors must then\r\nhave agreements to utilize trained and qualified union labor that\r\nhave received their craft training in state certified union craft\r\ntraining programs.\r\n                                \r\nSpecific training for the individual contract worker is\r\naccomplished by a twofold approach of Contractor training and\r\nOwner Orientation.\r\n\r\nThe Contractor, utilizing information provided by Bayway via the\r\ncontract exhibit Safety and Health Instructions for Contractors\r\nand the SHE manual, inform, train, and evaluate each employee.\r\nThis training information includes familiarization with the\r\nhazards of regulated substances found at the"
