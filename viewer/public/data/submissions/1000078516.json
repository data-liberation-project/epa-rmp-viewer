Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds multiple bunker mounted/ceiling suspended evaporator coils located in the refrigerated zones. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Inside the transfer vessel, the liquid rises in temperature and is returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the reciprocating/screw compressors.\n\n \n\nThe system also includes direct expansion (DX) ceiling suspended evaporator coils. In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receiver directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low te"

The vapor is then sent to the evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating.\n\n \n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nThe machinery room is equipped with two (2) ammonia detectors. A Drager PointGard 2100 provides concentration detection and alerts personnel if the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm. The Drager PointGard 2100 activates audible/visual alarms outside the machinery room. A Honeywell detector provides concentration detection at 25 ppm and notify facility personnel through an auto-dialer. Additionally, there are three (3) Honeywell and three (3) Maraco standalone detectors that provide concentration detection at 25 ppm which will alarm and notify facility personnel through an auto-dialer.\n\n\n\nThe sample system is equipped with an ammonia detector, vacuum pump, and tubing which extends to the rooms where air is sampled. The vacuum pump is used to draw air through the tubing into the detector. On 10 minute intervals, the system toggles from one sample point to the next. The sample system provides ammonia detection to non-machinery rooms as summarized below:\n\nCA Rooms Sample System\n\nCA Rooms 1-18\n\n\n\nThe sampling system/ammonia detector is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm and will activate an audible/visual alarm and notify plant personnel of the situation through"

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.
