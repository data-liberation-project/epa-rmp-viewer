The Division maintains an operations dispatch center and transmission and distribution (T&D) engineering office; electric overhead, underground, substation and service offices; and approximately 30 substations around the city. \n\nDallman Power Station was built in 1968 to answer the increasing electric demand of a growing city.  The first Dallman generator placed on line was Dallman 1, with a maximum capacity of 86 MW.  It was followed by a second 87 MW unit in 1972.  In 1978, a third turbine generator, with a maximum capability of 199 MW, more than doubled the power station's total generating capacity.  These three coal-fired units are intended to meet customer base load.  In 2000, Dallman's three generators used 927,535 tons of coal and 123,171 gallons of oil to generate 1,736,707 MWH of electricity. \nAll Dallman units are designed to burn coal.  Particulate emissions from the three units are controlled by electrostatic precipitators. In addition, the three units are equipped with flue gas desulfurization systems (scrubbers) to control sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. The scrubber for Dallman 3 was installed in 1980.  A second scrubber, serving the two older units, was put into operation in June 2001 in response to requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  All three Dallman units are now equipped with SCR units for the reduction of NOx emissions.\n\nThe SCR process requires ammonia and the anhydrous ammonia storage facility includes two 50,000-gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into the SCR emission control system."

      "SummaryText": "For the purpose of the RMP, anhydrous ammonia is the only one regulated substance at the facility.  With two 50,000-gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 467,040 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 233,520 pounds.\n\nIII. Summary of Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were identified and analyzed to determine the distance to endpoint for each assumed release.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, EPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp program was used. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as mandated by EPA\u00bfs rule on accidental release prevention, involves the rupture of the largest storage tank, in this case one of the 50,000-gallon storage tanks, and the release of all 233,520 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10-minute period.  The maximum amount of ammonia that can be stored in the tank is limited to that quantity by high-liquid-level controls and alarms.  No other mitigative device was considered in the analysis.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions of Class F stability and 1.5 meters per second wind speed, the distance to endpoint for the ammonia is 5.6 miles.  For ammonia, the endpoint concentration is 0.14 milligrams per liter, or 200 parts per million, in air.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 5,570 pounds of ammonia over 10 minutes from a failure to close manually the purge vent valve before beginning the ammonia unloading operation.  Although there is a water spray system that would be activated in this event and lessen the impact of the leaking chemical, it was not considered in this analysis.  Using typical meteorological conditions of Class D stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the distance to endpoint for the ammonia is 0.1 mile for the same endpoint concentration of 0.14 milligrams per liter, or 200 parts per million, in air.\n\n IV.

The procedures cover the required operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\nD.  Training - CWL&P's training program, as it relates to the SCR process, has been implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the workings of the process and are knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  These personnel were given initial training and will be provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\nE.  Mechanical Integrity - CWL&P conducts well-documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations. All process equipment routinely checked includes storage tanks and pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and venting systems, controls and pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and monitoring devices. All maintenance operations conducted on the SCR process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\n\nF.

Five Year Accident History \n\nNo accidents have occurred within the SCR process for the past 5 years.\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Part 68 rule distinguishes between those facilities that will respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and those that will not.  The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  For these facilities, an emergency action plan is required.  For a responding facility, the requirements are covered in Section 68.95 of the rule and a much more comprehensive emergency response plan is needed.  \n\nTo determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of response is commonly used.  It is the definition of response used in the OSHA HAZWOPER standard in 29 CFR 1910.120(a)(3) and is defined as \u00bfa response effort by employees from outside the immediate release area or by other designated responders \u00bf to an occurrence which results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.\u00bf  This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those \u00bfwhere the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.\u00bf  If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing in size, the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nFor non-responding facilities, an emergency action plan must include these elements:  (1) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignmen"

The plan includes such requirements as adequate first-aid and medical treatment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident response and decontamination of affected areas.  The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency action plan. \n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCWL&P is always receptive to suggestions from employees to improve safety.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly.  Further, employees are trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.  The many recommendations made during the process hazard analyses have been considered for implementation."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEmployee safety and environmental protection are the drivers for City Water, Light & Power (CWL&P) policies at our Dallman Power Station.  In our view, environmental protection includes the health and welfare of the community surrounding Dallman.  This is why CWL&P has installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce air pollution and use ammonia as the most efficient chemical in the industry to accomplish this reduction.  The use of ammonia means that CWL&P must develop and implement a risk management plan to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  We have done so and provide a description of that plan here.\n\nCWL&P is committed to environmental leadership in managing its generating station for the public benefit, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power.  CWL&P also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, which include the safe and responsible use of chemicals for air pollution reduction.  CWL&P management and employees are responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.  Beyond the development and implementation of this RMP, CWL&P\u00bfs commitment to environmental protection extends to the review of new developments in safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness.  All such activities are conducted in accordance with the most current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII.

Its successful implementation requires the active participation of plant employees and managers in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If a prevention program could be perfect, there would be little need for emergency response activities, since no unexpected releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program lowers the possibility of an accidental release and minimizes the consequences of a release should once occur.  The prevention program for the Dallman SCR process consists of twelve elements, which are briefly described here.\n\nA.

This information was used as the basis for the Process Hazard Analysis and is readily available for review and reference by employees.\n\nB.  Process Hazard Analysis - CWL&P conducted detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the process to ensure that the hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively. The What-If analysis methodology was used to assess these hazards.  The analyses, in the form of workshops, were conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations and facilitated by a person trained in the assessment methodology used.
