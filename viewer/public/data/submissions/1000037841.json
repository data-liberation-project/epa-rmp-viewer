EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calvert City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation, and is RC14001 Certified.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Calvert City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at ISP's Calvert City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Calvert City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n1.1        Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities, skills and training, and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid Association, Calv"

Calvert Industry, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Calvert City Fire Department have also established a system for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\n     \n\n     ISP's Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program for EPA-regulated processes at their respective facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Manager, Safety-Health & Security Manager, and Safety Engineer.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n1.2        ISP's Calvert City Plant Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility located in the Purchase Area of far Western Kentucky, in Calvert City, in northern Marshall County.  The ISP Plant is the largest industrial employer (approximately 520 site employees) in Marshall County.  We use the following chemicals as our feed materials: acetylene, ammonia, benzene, acetone, ethanol, butanediol, vinyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, iodine, styrene, methanol, propane, cyclohexylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, isobutylene, and isopropyl acetate. The ISP Calvert City Plant makes a variety of products:  Butyrolactone, 2-pyrrolidone, Vinyl "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\n     \n\n     The Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n     \n\n     The PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n     \n\n     To help ensure that the process controls"
