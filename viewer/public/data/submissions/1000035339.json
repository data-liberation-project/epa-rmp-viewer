The PHA systematically evaluates each process for potential hazards and then recommends change where needed.  These PHAs are revalidated every five years.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team is selected from management and employees.   Members are chosen based on their knowledge in operating and maintaining the process and engineering expertise.\n\n\n\nThe Smiley Hub considers a variety of factors when conducting the PHA using a combination of the \"What if\" and HAZOP methods for evaluating potential hazards.  Some of the factors considered are:\n\n 1.  Process Safety Information (PSI).\n\n 2.  Cause and Effects.\n\n 3.  Human factors.\n\n 4.  Public health.\n\n 5.  Environmental factors.\n\n 6.

Smiley uses these procedures for reference by experienced personnel and to provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are reviewed and modified whenever there are changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and/or facility.  Reviewing operating procedures is an element of the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  In addition, the accuracy of all operating procedures are recertified annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Smiley Hub has implemented a comprehensive training program to prepare potential process operators to safely and efficiently operate the facility.  Operators-in-training are taught an overview of the process, operating procedures, lock out/tag out, consequences of deviation, emergency response and operating parameters.  After an initial training phase, each candidate is paired with a senior operator for a minimum of 90 days to learn process specific tasks and duties.  The operator-in-training may remain paired with a senior operator beyond the 90 days if necessary, until they can demonstrate enough proficiency to satisfy the Operations Foreman.  The final step in becoming an operator is passing a rigorous written exam called the Compressor Operator Signoff (COS).  After all these requirements have been met, the new Operator can work independently.  New Operators are monitored by the Operations foremen.  Education is an ongoing process and as such, all operators receive periodic training related to their job duties.  In addition to all of this instruction, formal refresher training is conducted every three years. Each step of the operator training course is documented and becomes a permanent part of the employee's file.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, process maintenance personnel receive detailed training in each of the maintenance procedures as well as knowledge to diagnose and repair the process equipment.

To ensure that these contractors meet the safety and workplace standard, Smiley personnel complete contractor evaluation forms at regular intervals.  These completed forms are evaluated by safety and management to determine compliance with the established policies, procedures and guidelines.

Compressors and process equipment have been prepared for startup.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe elements of the Smiley Hub Mechanical Integrity program are periodic tests and inspections, regular maintenance, trained personnel, work order systems, written procedures and  record keeping.  The program includes pressure vessels, atmospheric tanks, piping, relief and vent systems, process equipment, pumps, compressors as well as dehydration, hot oil and flaring equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training including:\n\n(1) an overview of the process, \n\n(2) safety and health hazards, \n\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n\n(4) emergency procedures, and \n\n(5) work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nWritten inspection, testing and maintenance procedures provide that work is performed properly, and serve as a basis for training maintenance personnel in their assigned duties\n\n\n\nInspections and tests are performed to ensure that the equipment functions as intended and to establish a baseline for future monitoring. If a deficiency is identified that presents a safety concern, Smiley Hub personnel will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nSafe work practices at the Smiley Hub are defined by  (1) the corporate safe practices manual, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to isolate energy sources for equipment and piping undergoing maintenance, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to verify that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. (5) procedures to control entry into the facility.  These practices along with training and procedures help to ensure that operating and maintenance activities at the hub are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Smiley Hub has a comprehensive system to manage changes t"

This system requires that changes such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions of the process), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and operating procedures are updated prior to incorporating these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel and affected contractors are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Smiley Hub promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the factors that may have led to the incident, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Smiley Hub management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the recommendations. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future and revalidated PHAs.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo determine that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Smiley Hub conducts compliance audits every three years.  Smiley Hub employs a third party to conduct the audit to ensure impart"
