      "SummaryText": "y Analysis Report [SAR].  The SAR describes\nthe uranium enrichment operations and the management systems and programs used for\noperating the plant.  Chemical risks to the workers, the public and the environment are addressed\nby safety analyses, process hazard analyses [PHA], commercial safety and health guidance, and\nan emergency preparedness program.  \n\nIn addition to the NRC Certification process, PORTS is also covered by and in compliance with\nthe OSHA PSM and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act [EPCRA]\nSection 302.  PORTS has also submitted an application for a Title V permit to the state of Ohio\nin accordance with the applicable state regulations, but the permit has not yet been issued. \n\nPORTS has three toxic chemicals in threshold quantities stipulated in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A:\nchlorine, fluorine and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride [HF].  These three chemicals are used in two\nseparate processes.  PORTS does not have any flammable chemicals subject to the RMP\nregulations.\n\nProcess One - Chlorine\n\nPORTS has its own water treatment plant that provides water for process cooling and sanitary\npurposes.  The X-611 Water Treatment facilities, capable of treating over 20 million gallons of\nwater per day, produces up to 6 million gallons per day using a chlorine treatment process.  The\nsanitary water treatment process is similar to other water treatment plants throughout the United\nStates that use chlorine to disinfect the water for sanitary purposes.\n\nThe chlorine, provided in 2,000 pound cylinders, has a maximum administrative limit of three\nfilled chlorine cylinders at any one time.  This quantity is in excess of the threshold quantities\nlisted in 40 CFR 68.  A typical working inventory is two cylinders attached to the system\nmanifold.  The third container, if present, would be in an unconnected storage position adjacent\nto the in-use cylinders.  All three container positions are inside a building with a vehicle door to\naccommodate deliveries.\n\nThe po"

      "SummaryText": "stulated worst case release scenario is based on a vehicle accident inside the chlorine\nbuilding that ruptures both the system manifold and the staged cylinder, causing the maximum\ninventory to be released within the building in ten minutes.  Holdup within the building reduces\nthe release rate to the air by a factor of 0.55, as per the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis\n[OCA] Guidelines.  The distance to the endpoint is taken from the applicable OCA table.\n\nThe alternate chlorine release scenario is based on a failure of the connector (a pigtail) between\nthe system manifold and a cylinder that causes both connected cylinders to be released into the\nbuilding at the calculated maximum flow rate through the manifold.  This flow rate was\ncalculated using a computer program called PIPELEAK and is part of the NRC-approved SAR. \nAgain, holdup within the building reduces the release rate to the air by a factor of 0.55 and the\ndistance to the endpoint is taken from the applicable OCA table.  The chlorine system has both\nmanual and automatic shutoff systems that would limit an actual release, but no credit was taken\nfor these systems in this analysis.\n\nProcess Two - Fluorine and Hydrogen Fluoride\n\nThe X-342 fluorine generation complex produces fluorine from HF.  The HF is received in 850\npound cylinders, with up to two cylinders connected to the fluorine generation system inside a\nheated cabinet within the X-342 building.  Additional cylinders are staged in a separate room. \nThe HF is electrolytically disassociated into hydrogen, which is discharged to the atmosphere,\nand fluorine, which is stored in a set of tanks enclosed in a third room.  The fluorine is used as\nneeded in the maintenance of the uranium enrichment equipment.  \n\nThe X-342 fluorine complex has the potential to release up to 1,290 pounds of fluorine or 6,800\npounds of HF.  The HF has an administrative limit of eight filled cylinders (nominally 850\npounds of HF per container) staged for use (unconnected but a"
