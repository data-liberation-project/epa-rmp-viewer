It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local regulations for storage and use of this regulated substance. For all incidents or situations requiring emegency response assistance, it is our policy to notify the City of Irving, TX Fire and Police Departments (911) for response to the emergency.\n\nFacility and the Regulated Substance Handled:  This facility formulates and blends liquid and solid chemicals into maintenance and cleaning products for industry and other commercial and public institutions.This facility is an industrial user of a propane-butane mixture as a propellant in the manufacture of aerosol products.  This process consists of two 10,000-gallon propane-butane storage tanks with interconnecting piping, compressors, pumps and the associated aerosol filling, capping and packaging equipment.  \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 10,000-gallon storage tank when filled to capacity (8,334 gallons), resulting in an uncontrolled release of flammable vapor and/or liquid to the atmosphere.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a failure in a 1.0-inch diameter pipe due to corrosion(pin-holes) and a 10-minute release to the atmosphere.  The resulting vapor cloud reaches an ignition source and explodes.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:  This facility complies with the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rule(40 CFR part 68) and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The LP-Gas System is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state laws.\n\nFive-year Acc"
