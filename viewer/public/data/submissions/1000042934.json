Heraeus Tenevo has been in operation at this facility for 29 years, providing quality products to customers and approximately 180 jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\n\nHeraeus Tenevo is committed to protecting the surrounding public, environment and health of its employees.  To ensure that Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) handling and storage processes are operating at its most safe capabilities the processes are continually monitored both quantitatively and qualitatively.  HF storage and handling process also have been designed with redundant safety features to limit human error, limit exposure to HF during production and abate emissions from respective operations.  In accordance with Heraeus Tenevo RMP program, the processes are qualitatively evaluated with a What IF hazard analysis to determine potential exposures and respective controls to minimize probability for loss.\n\nIn the event of a disaster or release, Heraeus Tenevo has developed an Emergency Response Plan to respond to applicable situations, evacuation of the facility and contact procedures for emergency authorities. \n\n\n\nStationary Sources & Regulated Substances\n\nHeraeus Tenevo stores Hydrofluoric Acid at a 70% concentration.  This chemical is stored in a liquid state within a 6500 gallon tank unit.  The unit is not capable of storing the maximum volume due engineering and administrative controls that have been implemented by Heraeus Tenevo.

Heraeus has implemented engineering controls such air emission abatement equipment, level alarms and interlocked shutoffs to prevent overfilling of all tanks processing HF, all HF tank storage units are equipped with double walled tanks and secondary containment with leak detection/alarm systems, and all HF piping is designed with double walls with leak detection systems.\n\n   \n\nHeraeus Tenevo also has several administrative initiatives that will aid in preventing the release of HF to the environment.  All personnel required to perform job duties with HF processing equipment are trained on specific operating procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, HF process safety requirements and emergency pill response procedures.  The process is continually monitored for potential maintenance issues, and equipment malfunctions through preventative maintenance programs and departmental inspections.  A process hazard analysis is also conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Program for Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Heraeus Tenevo has not experienced a reportable accidental release of Hydrofluoric Acid.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHeraeus Tenevo has designed and implemented an Emergency Response program to ensure proper information and training is in place to prevent employee and community Hydrofluoric Acid exposures.  The program details what local and state government agencies to contact in the event of a spill and what position is responsible for such actions.  Heraeus coordinates with representatives from the Gwinnett County Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit (Station 20), Technical Rescue Team (Station 24), and Station 14 "

The drills involve Heraeus Spill Team members assuming a supporting role with First Responders in responding to a simulated emergency medical situation involving a significant Hydrofluoric Acid spill/exposure \"incident\".  Post-exercise critiques are held to review response actions aimed at improving the overall group's effectiveness in handling future hazardous materials/emergency events.  This program also includes responses that are necessary in the event of incipient and large fires, likely natural disasters, and explosions.\n\n  \n\nHeraeus Tenevo employees do not respond to significant Hydrofluoric Acid releases.  The process is designed to contain all spills to prevent the migration of liquid and chemical exposures.  If a significant spill occurs, employees are trained to notify management and an outside contractor will proceed with the cleanup.\n\n  \n\nThe Heraeus Tenevo Buford, GA. Plant is included in the community emergency response plan developed by the Georgia DNR-EPD (Region 7 of the LEPC).\n\n\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n\nHeraeus Tenevo is committed to developing and nurturing a proactive and continual safety program.  These efforts include having an active safety program and team, providing consistent training on specific process hazards and continually evaluating the program and processes for process improvements."
