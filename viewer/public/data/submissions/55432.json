Kentucky Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Louisville facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The  Maintenance Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necess"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nKentucky Distribution Center is part of Zenith Logistics Inc.  The facility is a  warehouse that  stores perishable and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 20,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Kentucky Distribution Center facility involves the release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typi"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices;\n         The system is operated at considerably lower pressures compared to the PSV's relief pressure setting;\n         Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n         The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the pressure relief devic"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements consistent with OSHA 1910.119 requirements.:\n\n         Employee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing all aspects of the program.  Employees are involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n         Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Information is complete per the OSHA PSM requirements.\n\n         Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-if and What-If/Checklist  Techniques have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety.  PHAs are reviewed on a five year basis.\n\n         Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.  Procedures are reviewed and updated if necessary annually.\n\n         Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Contractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.
