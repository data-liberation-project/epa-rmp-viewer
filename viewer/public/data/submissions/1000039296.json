      "SummaryText": "NewPage Corporation (NewPage) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for NewPage workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, NewPage has established procedures to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facilities.  NewPage's Wisconsin Rapids Mill - Fiber and Energy (Mill) has developed a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (the RMP rule) and helps to manage the risks of the covered substances and processes.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan describing the risk management program at NewPage's Mill.  This document is intended to satisfy the risk management plan requirements of the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nNewPage continues a commitment to the environment as it strives to prevent pollution and achieve the objective of operating facilities with minimal environmental impact.  The corporate sustainable development report is publicly available on NewPage's Internet website.  As part of its safety first objective, NewPage will strive to minimize environmental, health, and safety risks to its employees and the communities in which it operates by employing safe technologies and operating procedures.  NewPage will be constantly prepared for emergencies.  NewPage will continually inform its employees and public of its progress in safety and environmental issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nNewPage is headquartered in Miamisburg, Ohio, an area known for its rich heritage in the paper industry and for providing a workforce with a strong work ethic.  NewPage has approximately 8,500 employees in various locations across the United States and Canada.  NewPage is the largest coated paper manufacturer in North America, based on production capacity, with $4.7"

      "SummaryText": "billion in pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The company's product portfolio is the broadest in North America and includes coated freshsheet, coated groundwood, supercalendered, newsprint and specialty papers.  These papers are used for coporate collateral, commercial printing, magazines, catalogs, books, coupons, newspapers, inserts, packaging applications and direct mail advertising.\r\n\r\nNewPage operates paper mills located in Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.  Ten of these paper mills are at least partially integrated mills, meaning that they produce paper, pulp, and energy.  Most of the energy produced at these mills is for internal use.  We have a total combined  annual production capacity of approximately 5.5 million short tons of paper, including approximately 4.3 million short tons of coated paper, approximately 920,000 short tons of uncoated paper and approximately 300,000 short tons of specialty paper, as well as approximately 3.2 million short tons of pulp.\r\n\r\nThe kraft pulp bleaching process in the manufacture of kraft pulp involves chemically treating the wood pulp fibers to reduce or remove lignin and resin.  NewPage's mechanical pulps are being bleached using a totally chlorine-free (TCF) process.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide and chlorine are the chemicals regulated by the RMP rule that are stored or handled at this facility in total quantities greater than or equal to the threshold quantities.  Chlorine dioxide is generated onsite as a gas under a slight vacuum and absorbed into water.  The chlorine dioxide liquid solution is stored in tanks and is used to bleach pulp.  The chlorine dioxide solution is stored in three vertical aboveground tanks with design capacities of 60,000 gallons, 60,000 gallons, and 103,000 gallons.  The chlorine dioxide solution has a concentration of 1% by weight of chlorine dioxide.  Thus, the total quantity of chlorine dioxide stored at the Mill is 20,098 lb.  The three chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "dioxide tanks are partially located inside a building.  The worst case scenario for chlorine dioxide would be a liquid spill and vaporization from the 8,600 lb-tank (103,000 gallon tank).  An alternative release scenario would be defined as an indoor 1,000-gallon spill due to a leak in the 8-inch diameter piping connecting the largest chlorine dioxide tank to the process.\r\n\r\nChlorine is stored in up to twelve aboveground cylinder tanks, each with a design capacity of one ton.  The total quantity of chlorine stored at this facility is 24,000 lb.  The chlorine cylinders are kept inside a building.  Chlorine is a toxic gas liquefied by pressure in the cylinder and is used to treat process water.  The worst case scenario for chlorine would be a gas release from one of the tanks or 2,000 lbs.  An alternative release scenario would be defined as a failure (leak or rupture) of the 0.25-inch diameter tubing connecting the chlorine cylinder to the water chlorination process.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nAs part of its corporate environmental policy, NewPage will continue to protect the environment and the health and well-being of fellow employees and communities by monitoring existing facilities to ensure that they meet all legal requirements through the use of safe technologies and operating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Mill complies with the prevention and emergency response procedures from all applicable regulations including certain applicable sections of RCRA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38).\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents at the Mill in the past five years that resulted in any adverse offsite impacts.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Mill's emergency response program includes a written Emergency Response Plan that discusses procedures to be followed in the case of a general emergency and specific procedures for t"

The Incident Command System is designed to provide both public and private sector emergency response personnel with a logical building block system for managing hazardous material emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe system is designed to begin at the point where emergency response personnel recognize that they are in fact, dealing with a hazardous material emergency, even when the exact hazardous material has not be identified.\r\n\r\nThe local fire department is also trained to the Incident Command System and will join with the Mill team members and co-command on an incident.\r\n\r\nThe Incident Command System identifies a chain of command in response situations.  It also identifies specific responsibilities for the various levels in that chain.  The Mill has trained incident commanders, specialists, and technicians.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, NewPage has a spill reporting policy that addresses the notification requirements in the event of an accidental release.  The spill reporting policy also identifies contacts and notification responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe Mill conducts incident investigations for all events, including minor situations that involve chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nThis facility will undergo regular scheduled maintenance and update to meet any new or revised applicable regulation and industry standard to continue to operate safely."
