When an emergency call is received by telephone or radio at Security Headquarters, the dispatcher has the ability to activate alarms that signal refinery personnel to take action.  An alarm received by fire pull box is a general area alarm and first responders normally communicate by radio the details of the emergency upon arrival on the scene.  The level of response to the emergency is then adjusted as appropriate to the incident.  The dispatcher at Security Headquarters has the ability to pick up a direct dial telephone to the City of Philadelphia Fire Department to request assistance, or advise on the status of an emergency in progress. The Fire Department and the Police Department would be consulted using this information to assist them in making decisions on advising the public to evacuate or shelter-in-place.

Today, these two areas are operated as a fully integrated petroleum refining complex capable of processing 355,000 barrels per day of crude oil into various petroleum products including: gasoline, home and industrial heating fuels, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), residual fuel and a number of petrochemicals such as Benzene, Propylene, and Cumene.  \n\nThe types of processing units in operation at the refinery include: atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, distillate desulfurization, alkylation, sulfur recovery, petrochemical recovery, and gasoline treating and blending.  In support of these processes, the refinery also operates steam generation, water treating, wastewater treatment, tank car and truck loading facilities, and numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks.  \n\nSunoco also owns and operates the 211-acre Schuylkill River Tank Farm (SRTF) located on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, opposite the refinery property.  The facility functions as a product storage and shipping area and contains no refining units.  On-site are numerous intermediate and finished product storage tanks, an API-type separator, gasoline blending facilities, and an LPG tank car and truck loading area.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nCHEMICAL  USE\nHydrogen Fluoride (HF) \tAlkylation Unit Catalyst\n\nFlammables\n\nCHEMICAL  USE\nPropane - Commercial Fuel\nButane - Gasoline Blending\nIsobutane - Gasoline Blending/Intermediate Feedstock\nFlammable Mixture - Petrochemical Feedstock\n(Contains: Propane, Propylene) \nFlammable Mixture \t\tIntermediate Feedstocks for Refinery Processing\n(May contain: 1-Butene,"

Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety system that has an \"our\" attitude. Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.

Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHAs are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of operation and are designed and implemented for a safe, reliable and environmentally sound operation. Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \n\n     5. Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom tra"

Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n     7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process. A written Management of Change procedure has been established and implemented to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, and equipment.  The procedure provides guidance, designates responsibilities and establishes steps to implement changes in the refinery. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Philadelphia Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \n\n     8.

Compliance Audits\n\nThe refinery Process Safety Coordinator is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a corporate audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance. Refinery management promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and tracks all findings until they are resolved.\n\n     10. Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents (within 48 hours) that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Safety"

Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n     12. Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.  The safety regulations require contractors to train their employees in the safe work practices and safety rules of the refinery. The program also includes a refinery overview video that is shown to all contractor employees to familiarize them with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working.\n\n     13. Emergency Response\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan assures the readiness of employees to respond appropriately and safely to emergencies involving highly hazardous chemicals.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had three accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. These accidents are deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in onsite personnel injuries that required medical treatment, resulted in significant property damage onsite or resulted in property damage offsite.  No offsite injuries occurred due to these incidents. For each of these incidents, we have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the events and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The following is a brief summary of these incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn April 4, 2003, while removing a blind from a feed line (which was thought to be empty) to a propane bullet, a mechanic experienced a burn to his thigh when liquid propane was discharged.  The incident investigation showed the cause of the release was a leaking inlet valve that had leaked propane downstream of the valve to the area of the blind.   After this incident, all leaking inlet valves to the propane bullets were replaced and a new valve was installed to give the option to safely isolate the feed lines to the propane bullets in the future.  Also, investigation results, as well as safe work practices when working on jobs with multiple lines, were reviewed with operations and maintenance personnel.\n\nOn January 18, 2003, low fuel gas pressure caused the flame in a heater to blow out.  Unignited fuel gas (consisting of mostly methane) was introduced into the heater, resulting in an explosion that led to a release of gas oil and subseq"

The incident investigation revealed the fuel gas controller was poorly winterized, no operating procedures existed to address the specific situation encountered, and that refinery safety standards had not been followed.  Following the investigation, all refinery operating procedures were reviewed to ensure that all units with heaters had emergency procedures to cover this situation, all emergency shutoff valve bypasses were car sealed closed (per company safety standards), and a standard winterization checklist was developed for all operating areas (which included likely and repetitive freeze up sites).\n\nOn January 25, 2005, a fire occurred when liquid froze in an out of service pipe, causing the pipe to fail and release a mixture of light hydrocarbons under high pressure.  The ensuing vapor cloud was ignited by a nearby heater, which caused a fire in the area of process heat exchangers.  No employees or contractors were injured during the event.  The incident investigation revealed that the out of service pipe was never adequately reviewed at the time it was take out of service to ensure that it had adequate freeze protection.  Following the investigation, a widespread initiative was created to identify and mitigate or remove all out of service piping.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe Philadelphia Refinery maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations, including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Sara Title III and the NER Emergency Response Plan. We maintain an integrated emergency response program that consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements into a single consolidated plan.

Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe continually strive to make the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  The facility\u00bfs focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, with proactive management of these issues.  For example, we revalidate the Process Hazard Analyses for approximately six (6) process units each year.  These analyses generate additional prevention and mitigation recommendations that result in on-going modifications to the facility.  In addition to the Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, the following improvements are being planned to help us prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Incorporation of the Conoco Phillips ReVAP\u00ae additive technology at our HF Alkylation Unit\n* Incorporation of Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) into Process Hazard Analyses\n* Safety Integrity Level (SIL) studies to evaluate compliance with ISA S84.01\n* Upgrades to emergency response apparatus and other fire protection systems\n* Improvements to the facility Evacuation Procedures\n* Improvements to instrumentation and computer systems\n* Structural steel fireproofing upgrades\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Sunoco Philadelphia Refinery is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.
