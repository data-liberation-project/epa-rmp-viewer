As facility management strives to improve safety at the facility, evaluations are documented by each department with suggested improvements, and other observations from the drills.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBoth operating divisions at the facility have worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe working environment.  Compliance Audits, PHA studies, Mechanical Integrity Inspections, in addition to routine PSM/RMP Committee Meetings have generated recommendations to improve safety and compliance at the facility.  These include enhancing employee training policies, revising standard operating procedures, improving documentation and recordkeeping, and updating preventative maintenance policies, as well as ammonia equipment repairs.\n\nKroger Company representatives along with consultants entrenched in risk management for ammonia refrigeration facilities provide guidance and assistance for the facility personnel to ensure outstanding issues are resolved, and that the facility remains in compliance.  The Kroger Riverside facility also plans to improve safety as follows:\n\n  --  Continued involvement of refrigeration and safety personnel in the ongoing development and implementation of the risk management policies.\n  --  Participation of key personnel in industry recommended training classes to ensure the facility is aware of evolving industry standards and techniques used to encourage a safety culture at the facility.\n  --  Conducting routine RMP / PSM Committee Meetings to ensure any issues identified by refrigeration personnel, contractors, consultants, or internal departments (Maintenance and/or Safety) are discussed an"

Safety features utilized for both ammonia refrigeration systems include ammonia leak detectors in the machinery room and other zones where ammonia equipment is located, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, and emergency stop controls.  All pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent to a water diffusion tank that is available to neutralize high pressure ammonia.  The Kroger / Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company facility, including the ammonia systems, was designed and constructed in accordance with the recognized industry codes and standards, which specifically outline requirements for the design and operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration systems are closed-loop systems without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks / unanticipated ammonia odors are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nContinued safety improvement for the ammonia refrigeration systems is a top priority for Kroger / Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company.  Both operating divisions at the facility (Distribution Center and Creamery) have formed PSM/RMP Committees that meet routinely (typically quarterly) to discuss and review any pending issues with the ammonia refrigeration system and/or the PSM/RMP policies, including any outstanding recommendations made as part of the routine implementation of the programs.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA\u2019s RMP regulation defines \u201caccident\u201d as the following: \n\n\u201cThe release must be from a covered process and in"

Compliance Audits are also conducted every 3 years that can identify potential gaps in compliance and recommend actions to achieve full compliance.\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) and the local fire department at the City of Riverside Fire Department house.  The ultimate goal for Kroger / Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company\u2019s PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid adverse impacts to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate the refrigeration systems safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern the ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as the broader ammonia refrigeration industry throughout the country.\n\nFor example, all compressors are routinely inspected for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings are routinely performed on compressor motors;  the condensers are inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  low and intermediate pressure receiver oil pots are drained, pump bearing wear is monitored;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year frequency.  Ammonia leak detectors, that are designed to alert audible + visual alarms and alerts via the control systems, are calibrated semi-annually.\n\nThe Kroger / Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.

The evaporators that service the Perishables cold storage warehouse are located on the roof in penthouses that enable easy access for maintenance and inspections of the air units and the valves.\n\nAmmonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to move heat from product, cold storage zones, and secondary coolants (glycol) to the outside atmosphere.  When heat is absorbed by the liquid ammonia, it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers, where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor, causing it to condense to a liquid.\n\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the both ammonia refrigeration systems including:  ammonia leak detection, auto purgers to remove non-condensible gasses, pressure relief system, and refrigeration control systems.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration, policies and programs have been developed for the Kroger / Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company facility to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequences of a significant release, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nPolicies developed for the PSM/RMP programs for both the Distribution Center and the Creamery include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permit, contractor management, and incident investigation.

It is located in the southeastern portion of the city of Riverside, California, just south of the junction of Interstate 215 and Highway 60.

Both of which maintain independent industrial refrigeration systems that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.\n\nThe Kroger / Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company facility in Riverside, CA manufactures, packages, and distributes food and beverage products and uses the ammonia refrigeration systems (closed-loop processes) for product freezing, cold storage logistics operations, ice making, and process fluid (i.e., glycol) cooling.  The maximum intended inventories of ammonia are approximately 53,000 pounds (Distribution Center Perishables Warehouse), and 17,000 pounds (Creamery).\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.
