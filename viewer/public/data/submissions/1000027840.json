The system is completely under vacuum. If the vacuum is lost for any reason, a spring loaded valve on each of the regulators immediately closes to stop the flow of chlorine gas. The chlorine storage system is monitored by two independent leak detection systems. \r\nListed below is a brief description of BTMUA's risk management program as it pertains to the location detailed above.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n1. The goal of BTMUA's Risk Management Program (RMP) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chlorine. BTMUA's delineation of this RMP element details responsibilities which involve Directors and Supervisors.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n2. BTMUA's RMP includes chlorine information on its toxicity, physical data, permissible exposure limits, reactivity data, corrosivity data, and thermal and chemical stability data. Information concerning the chlorination process chemistry, maximum inventory, safe upper and lower limits for temperature, pressures and flows or compositions, evaluation of consequences of deviations, piping and instrumentation diagram, materials of construction, electrical classification, ventilation system design, design codes and standards, safety systems, electrical one-line diagram, site plan, fire and sewer water system piping diagrams and external forces and events data are included in this element.

This audit is completed annually under the direction of the Director of Water Quality in coordination with the Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor, and the Director of Compliance, Safety & GIS.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n10. All chlorine leak accidents or potentially catastrophic events at the Authority will be promptly investigated. The purpose of the accident investigation element is to identify the underlying causes of an accident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the accident from reoccurring. The Water Treatment Plant Operations and Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for initiating this RMP element and ensures that any resulting corrective actions are addressed and documented.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PLAN\r\n11. BTMUA recognizes that it is essential to involve its employees in the development and implementation of an OSHA PSM and EPA/TCPA RMP.
