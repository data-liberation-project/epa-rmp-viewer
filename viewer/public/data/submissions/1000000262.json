Prindle Water Treatment Plant has \nbeen in continuous operation since its commissioning in 1929.  \nDuring this time NO (on or off premise)  CHLORINE RELATED INJURIES HAVE\nOCCURRED.\n\nThis enviable safety record is typical of the water treatment industry \nbecause safety precautions have always been an important part of water \ntreatment facility design.  Our chlorine feed system features delivery \nof chlorine to the point of application in a line under partial vacuum.\nShould this line sustain damage, it will leak air into the line instead of chlorine \nout to the atmosphere.\n\nOut of concern for the recreational boating and swimming facilities \nabutting our Plant, we incorporated a chlorine leak scrubber system into\na facility upgrade in 1986, long before the attention of the public and \nregulators turned to this issue.  This system features a leak detection\nsystem and can contain and neutralize the contents of a full ton \nchlorine cylinder without human intervention.  Integral to this system \nis automatic notification of our Fire Department.  \n\nWe have also built our own leak simulator from the head of an old \nchlorine cylinder.  This device is used for in-house and in cooperative \ndrills with the Fire Department to simulate various types of tank and \nvalve failures.  This enables us to maintain a high level of readiness \nas well as familiarity with the emergency procedures and equipment.\n\nOur concern for the public safety had led us to explore alternatives to \nthe use of gaseous chlorine.  A component of our next Plant renovation \neffort is the evaluation of sodium hypochlorite as a replacement.  \nThis project has been designed and will be incorporated into a Plant upgrade \nplanned for 2010-12 time-frame.\n\n06/03/2009\n\n"
