      "SummaryText": "The El Segundo Generating Station (ESGS) is a natural gas-fired electric generating station consisting of two operating units, Units 3 and 4, each rated at 335 megawatts (MW).  Each unit relies on an air pollution control device, known as a Selective Catalyic Reduction (SCR) device, which utilizes aqueous ammonia as the reducing agent in the reduction of nitogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen gas that is exhausted from natural gas combustion process.\n\nAqueous ammonia is supplied to the SCR devices by the Aqueous Ammonia System.  This process is the only ARP covered process at ESGS and is subject to both federal ARP and California ARP Program 2 requirements.  The 29.4% aqueous ammonia is delivered to an underground storage tank (UST) by tank trucks operated by the chemical supplier.  Supply pumps at the UST transfer the material from the tank through a pipeline to the two SCR vaporization skids (one for each unit) and the Chemical Feed Station in Unit 3.  \n\nThe UST consists of a 20,000-gallon, double-walled, FRP clad, carbon steel tank designed to the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII.  It is equipped with liquid level and overfill prevention, pressure relief valves, vacuum breaker, flame arrestor, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  A continuous leak detection system is provided with interstitial liquid sensors at each end of the tank bottom and local vapor detectors that are continuously monitored in the Control Room.  The UST contains three supply pumps (one active and two standby, each with a maximum capacity of 7 gallons per minute) that transfer the aqeous ammonia into the pipeline.  \n\nThe pipeline consists of a stainless steel piping at a maximum internal diameter of 2 inches, designed to ANSI B31.1, with pressure relief valves, flow solenoid shut-off valves, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  The pipeline is predominately aboveground except for two portions that extend under the site roads.  Undergound piping is con"

      "SummaryText": "tained within carbon steel piping with continuous liquid leak detection monitoring of the annular space.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia is delivered to the two SCR vaporization skids where it passes through a duplex strainer and a shutoff valve before splitting into two separate lines that each feed one of two vaporizors on each SCR skid.  Hot boiler (dilution) air is directed through the two vaporizors where atomizing nozzles spray the aquesous ammonia into the hot boiler air which evaporates the ammonia.  The air/ammonia mixture is then injected into the flue gas of each unit's boiler that then flows into SCR reactor.  The SCR reactor contains a horizontal flow catalyst bed where the NOx reacts with ammonia to form inert nitrogen gas and water that are exhausted through the stacks.\n\nThe Chemical Feed System is operated manually on a batch basis.  An operator must be present to hold open the dead-man valve on the aqueous ammonia supply line during filling of the transparent acrylic metering cylinder.  Once filled, the operator releases the dead-man valve which springs closed.  The operator then opens one of the two hand gate valves to gravity feed the aqeuous ammonia into either the Unit 3 or Unit 4 mix tanks that contain dilution water (two 50 gallon vertical carbon steel tanks).  The resulting mixture from the mix tanks is then pumped into the suction boiler feed pump and/or discharge condensate pump.  \n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage tank is filled via the chemical supplier's 6,000 gallon tanker truck with deliveries scheduled at regular intervals based on ammonia consumption.  Operating procedures require an ESGS operator to be present throughout the unloading process and be ready to respond to concerns.    \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.  ESGS has had an active hazardous materials management and accident prevention program that emphas safety and good management practices in all of its activities.

The core elements of the emergency response program include the following:\n*  Specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia\n*  Procedures to notify local and public agencies including the El Segundo Fire Department, the California Emergency Management Agency, and the National Response Center\n*  Contact and location for emergency medical care\n*  Information regarding the training of employees on responses to releases\n*  A list of Federal and state requirements the facility is subject\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include enhancing the information in operating procedures and training and enhancing the effectiveness of the management of change process."
