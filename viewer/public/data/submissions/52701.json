We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\n\nThe Enterprise Clay Center Terminal and Storage is owned by Enterprise Terminals & Storage, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mapletree, LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC..  \n\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help provide for the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances required by EPA's RMP regulation and the processes involved\n* A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n* Emergency Response Programs\n* General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals at the Clay Center Terminal that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.  \n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Clay Center facility is a pipeline, storage and transport truck loading facility.  The pipeline system is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipeline system which is regulated by the Department of Transportation.  The propane storage and loading facilities are regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 3 facility.\n\nThe Cla"

These two pipelines are a multiple product line (natural gasoline, naphtha, normal butane, iso-butane and propane) and a dedicated propane line both owned by Mid-America Pipeline Company, LLC.  Both pipelines are operated by Enterprise Products Operating LLC.  In addition, the facility receives propane from the dedicated propane pipeline into two propane storage tanks.  These tanks are used for distribution to the truck transport loading docks which also has capabilities to stench the propane for retail sales companies.  Both of the propane storage tanks  are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed a maximum capacity of 80% full.  If necessary, the facility can also receive and store propane taken from the mixed product pipeline.\n\nIn our facility we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals handled by the Enterprise operations at the Clay Center Terminal.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is a finished product which can be delivered into the two storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline, or the mixed product pipeline.  This material is routed from these tanks to the truck transport loading docks for wholesale delivery to propane retailers.  Flammable  Ethyl Mercaptan is also present at the terminal for use as a propane odorant, but the amount of Ethyl Mercaptan on site is less than the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenario and alternative release scenariofor our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposur"

Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals handled by the Enterprise Clay Center propane terminal.\n\nWorse Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of one of the two identical propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario would not be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  All emergency response and early warning to the employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting section of the Risk Management Plan\n\nAlternate Case Scenario ? Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 21,151 pounds of material would be released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  This consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  This scenario would be mitigated due to the type of scenario modeled.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Clay County LEPC, which includes the local Police department, Sheriff?s Department, Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the emergency notification alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate the emergency shutdown system, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Clay County Sheriff?s Department and local Fire Departments.  Remote activation can also be accomplished from the system?s control center which is based in Houston, Texas.  The Enterprise Houston Control Center has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shutdown remotely from Houston Control or locally by Operations.  A third party contractor, 3E is under contract to effectively contact the necessary agencies if required.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise Products takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.

A training program has been developed in which the Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.
