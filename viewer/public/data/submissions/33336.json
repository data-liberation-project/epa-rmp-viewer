      "SummaryText": "LAKE GAILLARD FACILITY\n\nThe Lake Gaillard Water Treatment Plant (Lake Gaillard) has one chlorine injection system.  The system has six one ton containers of chlorine on line and six containers on standby at any one time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is an automatic switch from online to standby when online containers are empty.  \n\nThe facility has five chlorine detectors to monitor leakage in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms. One detector in the chlorine storage room gives a digital readout of the atmospheric chlorine concentration.  The sensor is located in the storage room but the readout is located outside this area.  Chlorine sensors are located at six inches above floor level in both rooms.  The detector will alarm at the main control room panel and automatically start the wet scrubber in the affected area.  A chlorine release inside the building will be drawn into the scrubber and neutralized using sodium hydroxide adsorbent. The scrubber has the capacity to adsorb two full one ton containers of chlorine gas (4000 pounds of chlorine).\n\nThe Lake Gaillard Facility normally stores a maximum of 24 one-ton containers at the site at any one time.  All containers are stored indoors in a building with doors, which seal.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area.  The building doors are opened and the chlorine containers are brought inside.\n\nNormally the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms are sealed with doors that remain closed unless chlorine is being unloaded.  All chlorine containers are stored within the chlorine storage room.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound and the wet scrubber starts-up automatically.  Air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building.  The scrubber will provide a negative pressure within the building and not allow the chlorine gas to leak outside.\n\nThe facility also has an emergency response team w"
