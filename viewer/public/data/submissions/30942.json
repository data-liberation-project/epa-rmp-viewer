We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n? A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n? An overview of our emergency response program\n? An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n? The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n? The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n2.0   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces flexible polyurethane foam using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The facility is housed in an approximately 125,000 sq. ft. building located in an industrial area.  The process area is divided into two areas; one being the process building, which houses the tank farm, which is diked, and the process area located in the upper half of the process building.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n? Process hazard assessment\n? Process hazard review \n? Operating procedures\n? Training\n? Mechanical integrity\n? Compliance audits\n? Incident investigation\n? Employee participation\n? Hot work permit\n? Contractors\n\nThe key to preventing accidental chemical releases are the Standard Operating Procedures that are in Appendix D.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n4.0   Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of TDI in the past 5 years.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the"

Additional two-way radios to improve communications during operations.\n2,  Fixed monitors.\n3.  High level alarms.\n\n\n7.0 Certifications\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, our Risk Management Program is written to comply with Program level two.  The distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the covered process may impact the small residential population surrounding the facility.\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental releases that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  We have taken voluntary measures to improve our operations to minimize potential releases of covered materials in order to protect both our employees and the public.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMPlan.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\nSignature_________________________________________\n\nTitle_____________________________________________\n\nDate_____________________________________________\n\n\n8.0 RMP Data Elements\n\nThe following pages present additional information about our risk management program that EPA?s RMP rule has asked us to provide.
