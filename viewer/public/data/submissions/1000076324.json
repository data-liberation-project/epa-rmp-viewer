Those notes have been left in to show that Program 3 is the correct program and how it was changed back in 2014 from an inadvertent change to program 2 in 2004. \n\n\n\nIt was brought to Sioux City's attention that Program 2 was not the correct program to file under.  In 1999 Sioux City submitted the first RMP under Program 3 and in 2004 the program somehow changed to a program 2.  A representative from EPA was on site a few years back to identify why Sioux City filed as a program 2 and after going through the checklist for program 3 it was found that Sioux City was complying with program 3.  The RMP has been changed to reflect the correct filing under program 3.\n\n\n\nAPPLICABILITY\n\n\n\nThe Sioux City Water Treatment Plant in Sioux City, IA uses chlorine for disinfection as part of its process to provide quality drinking water to its citizens. Chlorine is purchased in ton cylinders and stored in a special chemical feed building outside the main water treatment plant. At any time, there could be as many as 8 chlorine ton cylinders in the storage room. The building contains local and remote warnings and will automatically close all vents if there is a chlorine leak and the scrubber will start upon those warnings.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and is in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program requirements.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, presence of chlorine detectors, a scrubber and chlorine room that will lockup if there is a chlorine leak. Also the Sioux City Fire Department HazMat team is available almost immediately.\n\n\n\nSafety Data Sheet (SDS) for Chlorine is available in compliance with 29 CFR\n\n1910.120"

Documentation includes the hazards associated with chlorine and the chlorination process; the possibility of equipment malfunctions or human error, and the steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.\n\n\n\nAll equipment was inspected during the hazard review; it was determined that the chlorination facility was designed, built and operated in accordance with applicable codes and industrial guidelines.\n\n\n\nThe results of the hazard review were documented. The hazard review will be updated at least- once every five years. The City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant will also conduct reviews whenever a major change in the process occurs; all issues identified in the review will be resolved before startup of the changed process.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities associated with the chlorination process. They are consistent with the applicable safety information.\n\n\n\nThe following procedures are in the City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant General operation and maintenance manual for chlorination system: initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and operations, normal shutdown, startup following a normal or emergency shutdown or a major change that requires a hazard review; consequences of deviations and steps required to correct or avoid deviations; and equipment inspections.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant will update these operating procedures if necessary, whenever a major change occurs and prior to startup to the changed process.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant ensures that each employee presently operating the chlorination process a"

Refresher training is provided yearly to each employee operating the chlorination process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures in the process. This frequency of refresher training was determined by consultation with the employees operating the process. The City ensures that workers are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant has prepared and implemented procedures to maintain the on-going mechanical integrity of the chlorination process equipment. Some procedures or instructions were provided by chlorination process equipment vendors. Each employee involved in maintaining the on-going mechanical integrity of the chlorination process has been trained. To ensure that the employee can perform the job tasks in a safe manner, each employee was trained in the hazards of the process, in how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions, and in the procedure applicable to the employees job task.\n\n\n\nThe Water Plant does not commonly use outside maintenance contractors, but the City of Sioux City does verify that any such contractors are trained to perform the required maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant performs inspections and tests on chlorination equipment.

The plant will retain the two most recent compliance audit reports within the prior five-year period.\n\n\n\nThe City of Sioux City Water Treatment Plant will investigate each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release. An incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. A summary will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation including; date of incident, date investigation began, a description of the incident, the factors that contributed to the incident, and any recommendations resulting from the investigation.

It is the intent of the City of Sioux City to again review these policies and make the necessary improvements within the next year.\n\n\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\n\n\nThe topography type selected for input into the scenario analysis was urban (terrain with many obstructions). A review of USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps of the area shows the water treatment plant is located in the Missouri River Valley. A line of bluffs rising 199 plus feet above the valley form a semicircle around the plant from the Northwest to the Northeast. A series of buildings lie immediately west of the treatment plant along with one building setting directly east of the Plant. The Missouri River is approximately, 1,500 feet south of the treatment plant and 2000 feet South and Southeast of South Sioux City, Nebraska.\n\n\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS FOR WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe meteorological conditions for the worst-case are specified in the RMP regulations as follows.\n\n    Wind Speed-    1 .Smeters/second (3.4 miles/hour)\n\n    Stability Class-    F (very stable conditions)\n\n    Air Temperature-    25 degrees C (77 degrees F)\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe regulations define the worst case release as a catastrophic release in which the total content of the single largest vessel onsite is released to the environment. All of the chlorine storage vessels at the Water Treatment facility are one ton cylinders. For this analysis, the cylinder was assumed to be outdoors when the release occurs.\n\n\n\nFor toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient pressure, the regulations stipulate the release time f"

The endpoint analysis was completed using RMP*Comp software developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At a release rate of 200 lbs. Per minute for 10 minutes directly to the environment, the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is calculated to read a radius of approximately 2.1 kilometers (1.3 miles) around the water treatment plant.\n\n\n\nThe offsite receptors were determined as follows:\n\n\n\nResidential Population: Siouxland Interstate Metropolitan Planning Council (SIMPCO) using the US Census Bureau LAND VIEW III mapping Program. The estimated residential population within the worst case consequence zone is 550.\n\n\n\nPublic receptors: a review of the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle map for Sioux City indicates there are schools, hospitals, public recreation areas, major commercial and industrial areas located within the worst case consequence zone.\n\n\n\nThere are no Environmental receptors within the quadrangle of Sioux City.\n\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nHazard Review: Chlorine is withdrawn at a valve near the top of the cylinder and it flows via plastic line to a gas regulator. Chlorine is withdrawn from the regulator via a vacuum and is routed to the chlorine injector through approximately 20 ft. of 5/8A? plastic tubing. If a break occurs at any location within the plastic tubing, the vacuum is lost and all chlorine flow stops. If a break occurs before the regulator, chlorine will escape until mitigation measures can be applied by emergency responders. Based upon the hazard review conduced by facility personnel, the most likely release scenario resulting in offsite consequences would be a break in the cylinder valve.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the release occurs within the chlorine storage building and that all doors are closed prior "
