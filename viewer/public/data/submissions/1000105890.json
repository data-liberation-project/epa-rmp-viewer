Gas Innovations also handles Hydrogen Chloride in exceedance of its threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.  These gases are distributed to clients in bulk or cylinders.  These regulated substances are stored at the site in bulk process storage tanks.  These tanks are filled between 85% and 88% of their capacity.  The expected quantities stored and used at the site of these regulated substances vary from 17,000 pounds to 62,000 pounds.  \n\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nGas Innovations has implemented an emergency response program that includes incident prevention and investigation.
