This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Longview Rail Facility complete training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring our high standards.\r\n\r\nThe Longview Rail Facility is operated by American Midstream. The primary functions of the Longview Rail Facility are unloading and storage of NGL Liquids delivered via rail car. Unloading of product is accomplished by applying compressed gas vapor to the vapor space of the railcar which pushes the product to storage vessels. Stored product is delivered the adjacent Longview Gas Plant Facility through interconnecting piping and pumps. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nThe following is a summary of the acci"

Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)Risk Management Program (RMP).  This summary addresses each of the RMP Level 2 elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nSafety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective RMP program and to completing and maintaining a Hazard Review. The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the HAZARD REVIEW; those in charge of training; contractors; those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Longview Rail Facility keeps a variety of technical documents used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\r\n\r\nHazard Review: The Longview Rail Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the What-if method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of\r\nthe process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, when deemed necessary.  Periodic review"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Program: The Longview Rail Facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: American Midstream has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazard"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation: The Longview Rail Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: To help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Longview Rail Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Longview Rail Facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History:\r\nThe Longview Rail Facility has no history of releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in onsite or offsite effects. American Midstream places daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure an incident-free record continues.\r\n\r\nEmergency"

Activation of this emergency response plan sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly. All agencies and personnel respond to predetermined staging areas with representatives from each agency reporting to the Central Command Post (CP).  A contingency plan is developed and executed using trained industry personnel along with other emergency response personnel from responding agencies, as needed.  Employees of this facility are issued individual copies of the Emergency Action Plan when initially hired. All of the operators at this facility have had the appropriate emergency response training as mandated by the OSHA standard."
