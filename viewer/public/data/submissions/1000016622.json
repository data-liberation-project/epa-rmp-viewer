      "SummaryText": "The Blue Mountain Faulkner 1 renewable energy geothermal plant (Facility) is operated by NGP Blue Mountain I LLC.   The Facility is a 49.5 MW gross, 40 MW net binary geothermal power plant located approximately 25 miles west of Winnemucca, Nevada in rural Humboldt County.  The Facility is located on a combination of leased BLM and private parcels of land.  There are no residential communities, schools or hospitals located within 22 miles of the Facility.\nThe Facility extracts hot brine from production wells, which is used as a natural heat source to flash a working fluid that has a lower boiling point than water: iso-pentane. The iso-pentane drives three turbines connected to electrical generators that produce renewable power sold to NV Energy. The iso-pentane is circulated in a closed loop system for continual re-use. \nDuring construction of the plant in 2008-09, NGP obtained a permit to operate from Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP), Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  As such, the facility has in place and operates under the following elements of the CAPP program, all of which are designed to prevent accidental release of the plant's potentially flammable iso-pentane working fluid.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmergency Action Plan\n\u00c2\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPre-startup safety review\n\u00c2\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u00c2\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tManagement of change\n\u00c2\u00bf\tContractor Program\n\u00c2\u00bf\tCompliance audit\n\u00c2\u00bf\tProgram management\nSince Blue Mountain Falkner 1 went into commercial service, there have been no accidents involving off-site consequences or which have resulted in the release of iso-pentane.\nAll Facility employees are trained consistent with the CAPP program and the Facility's CAPP permit, including the Emergency Action Plan.  Local agencies such as Humboldt County Sheriff, Humboldt General Hospital, BLM and Winnemucca Fire Department have reviewed the Facility's Emergency Action Plan."
