The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA Standards.  Processes at our facility are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.    The following sections briefly describe the main elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility. \n\n1. Employee Participation - all employees at ATOFINA Bayport are involved in our safety program.  ATOFINA believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees actively participate in accident prevention and development of our process safety management programs.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the Risk Management Plan rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n2. Process Safety Information (PSI) - ATOFINA maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our processes.  The information is kept current and is available to all employees.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Systems are in place to safely manage change as part of our process safety management program.   Comprehensive hazard reviews (where teams of employees examine potential hazards and develop ways to mitigate them) are performed to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The reviews are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed promptly.  \n\n4. Operating Procedu"

We coordinate our emergency plan with the Southeast Regional LEPC, our facility?s Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  ATOFINA Bayport has been an active member of the LEPC since purchasing the plant in 1992.  The planning effort of the LEPC helps ensure our emergency plan is coordinated with that of the local municipalities.  \n\nTo quickly and effectively respond to emergencies at our facility, ATOFINA maintains both a mobile aerial foam truck and a fast attack truck onsite.  The entire plant is surrounded by an underground firewater header that will supply firewater from our 1.2 million gallon firewater storage tank.  In addition, our firewater system is also tied into the fire water system of the neighboring plant. This serves both as a backup to our system and offers additional firewater capacity if needed.  Fixed fire monitors and deluge systems are in place throughout the facility to respond to fires.  We have emergency flares in place to safely combust flammable chemicals during upsets or emergencies.  To ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. \n\nThe facility has a Whalen alarm system to alert nearby persons during emergencies.  We also have procedures in place to alert the surrounding communities during emergencies. We employ trained emergency responders, including onsite industrial firefighters, who train annually at the Texas A&M University Industrial Fire Fighting School.  We also have an onsite emergency medical team and an onsite rescue team.  Our hazardous materials response team is 40-hour HAZMAT certified and can respond to incidents both on and offsite.  Additional personnel are on contract to provide emergency response equipment, expertise, and manpower if needed.  \n\nWe have an emergency communications link to offsite responders through our emergency radio system, which w"

In addition to the Southeast Regional LEPC, we also closely coordinate our emergency plan with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  Procedures are in place to quickly notify CIMA by radio or telephone to bring in additional help if required.  CIMA is the largest industry mutual aid organization in the world.  It is a ?joining together? of firefighting, rescue, hazardous materials, and emergency medical manpower and equipment from more than 100 industrial facilities and federal, state, and local emergency response agencies in the Houston area for mutual assistance in case of an emergency.  We conduct quarterly drills on emergency procedures at the facility (fire, medical emergency, plant evacuation, rescue) with our neighboring plants often participating.   Our responders also participate in the annual CIMA Zone 4 Drill and the annual general membership drill.\n\nContinual Improvement\nContinual improvement is an integral component of our risk management program.  We recognize that even the best system can be improved.  We are continually working to reduce our accident and release rate, primarily through employee involvement in our Facility Safety Plan.  We seek to learn as much as possible from facility drills and any unusual incidents.  Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We are in the process of installing emergency shutdown and isolation systems for the unloading of railcars containing flammable products.   In the future, we will add additional deluge systems and improve our facility foam systems.  Revalidation of our Process Hazard Analysis, Operator Requalification, and continued development of the ATOFINA Integrated Management System (AIMS) are other major steps we will take to further improve safety at our facility.
