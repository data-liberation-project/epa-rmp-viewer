Liquid ferric chloride is primarily used in water/wastewater traement and phosphate removal.  PVS Technologies, Inc. operates a ferric chloride manufacturing facility that is located on 1 N. Buchanan Street (c/o US Steel), Route 21, Gary , Indiana 46402.\n\nThe ferric chloride production process uses liquid chlorine as reagent.  Chlorine, the 17th element on the periodic table, is commonly used in the purification of potable water.  Other uses include hospital sanitation, swimming pool treatment, etc.  Chlorine is also a basic ingredient in the production of pharmaceutical and agricultural products as well as consumer products such as vinyl chloride siding for houses, PVC pipes for plumbing, etc.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also necessitate the adoption of safety precautions in its handling.\n\nIn concert with our overall commitment to Responsible Care, it is our policy to design, operate and maintain our manufacturing facility in such a manner that minimizes any risks to our employees, our local community and the environment.  In brief, our goal is as follows: \"No accidents, injuries or environmental mishaps.\"  The PVS Technologies-Gary Facility has no accidents as defined under the RMP rule in the previous five years.\n\nIn addition to our pledge for full compliance with all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, we have been actively engaged in developing and applying not only sound technology but also safe operating procedures to our production process.  Our chlorine unloading system is designed in accordance with the Chlorine Institute standards.  We conduct Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies on all chlorine related process designs and modifications.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also performed whenever necessary.

A two-stage scrubber system is installed for proper neutralization of any residual levels of chlorine from our process.  Routine safety audits (tailored to the Dupont Safet Audit Program) are conducted by both supervisors and plant employees.  A preventive maintenance program is in place for properly planning and documenting any repair and/or maintenance activities on our process equipment.  The employee training program which includes the annual PVS 32-Hour training requirement, the OSHA 24-Hour HAZOPER training (initiall and refresher) and others are conducted in order to maintain and/or enhance process safety.  Our Emergency Response Plan includes specific guidelines for getting the right people (both on-site and off-site) to the scene quickly.  In the event of an emergency involving a chlorine release, PVS Technologies personnel are trained in measures to control the release.  In addition, our Emergency Response Plan has been provided to local response organizations for inclusion into the Community Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThe regulated material. i.e., liquid chlorine, is brought to our facility by railcars that are unloaded directly to the process.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, supervisory staff and approved contractors.  The maximum inventory of chlorine stored at the Gary facility is 360,000 pounds (two railcars).  Only one railcar is hooked up to the production process at any time.\n\nThe worst case scenario, as required by USEPA,  involves the failure of a 90-Ton railcar, thus releasing the entire content to the atmosphere within ten minutes.  The liquid chlorine flashes immediately to vapor and fine liquid droplets and is carried downwind.  The release would have off-site consequences.
