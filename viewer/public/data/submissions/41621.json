The RWTP emergency response services availabe in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n       The RWTP chlorination facility has been installed to disinfect the water being treated in the RWTP . This water services the City of Russell. The chlorination station is located at 210 South Front Street, next to the water treatment equipment. The amount of chlorine handled is two one-ton containers. The facility is normally manned. Water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble which may occur. \n       Atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decrease to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected at EPA of 3ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2). This is designed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association(AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individuals ability to take protective action. \"The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined,\" to estimate the population potentially affected.\" The worst-case release scenario at the Russell Water treatment Plant involves a failure of the two ton-containers which could be connected concurrently(a total of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.The set followed conditions pre-defined"

At an average rate over one hour defined by AIHA as maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects. The typical meteirilogical conditions used were stability E, end speed 2.0 m/sec.average air temperature of 62F, and 63% average humidity. The estimated distances traveled to the toxic endpoints are 4300ft. For the ETPG-2.\n      Actuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure consideered. An additional mitigation system installed is the conversion of the existing chlorinators to a remote vacumm type with all pressurized chlorine gas piping replaced with vacuum piping. This will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine released in case of pigtail rupture.\n    "
