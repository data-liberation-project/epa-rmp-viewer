The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids (NGL, also known as Y grade) are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\nTarga Pipeline's Velma Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, and take actions within the capabilities of the facility.  Velma Gas Plant personnel are trained first responders for certain release scenarios involving hydrogen sulfide, but would rely on outside first responders for release scenarios involving flammables.  For all release scenarios, Velma personnel would notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\n\n\nThe Velma Gas Plant is located one mile west of Velma, Oklahoma on old Highway 7 and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products and byproducts:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade natural gas liquid,\n\n2. Condensate, and\n\n3. Residue (methane) gas.\n\n\n\nThe above products contain various mixtures of the following hydrocarbons:\n\n\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\n\n\nThe Velma Gas Plant also produces acid gas (containing"

The acid gas is sent to an underground injection system. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 697,698 pounds (lbs) (180,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in two connected processes.  This flammable mixture is contained in one high pressure (V-0050-1-152) product surge vessel and two low pressure product surge vessels (V-0050-1-160 and V-0050-1-160-1) associated with the V-100 plant.  The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since the facility is located near the town of Velma, the WCS for flammable substances could affect off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors.  Targa Pipeline has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences. Passive mitigation measures include an automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and move the actuated valves to their fail-safe position, which diverts all incoming gas to the emergency flare system. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at Velma Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of the flammable mixture from two inch holes at the bottom of the surge vessels (558,158 lbs over a 15 minute period).  The release is expected to be isolated by plant operation personnel within 15 minutes or by automated plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and moving actuated valves to their fail-safe position, which diverts all incoming gas to the emergency flare system. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES: \n\n\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of a toxic substance at Velma Gas Plant is a pipe rupture at the well head for the acid gas (hydrogen sulfide) underground injection system, between the automatic chec"

This would release acid gas directly from the two inch well head casing pipe into the air until plant operation personnel could safely and property close the valve or kill the well, which is estimated to take about 24 hours. The well pipeline connects to a large underground reservoir with a resulting worst-case release rate of 1,456 pounds per hour (lb/hr), or 34,945 lbs total of hydrogen sulfide released over the 24-hour period.  Since the facility is located near the town of Velma, the WCS for toxic substances could affect off-site endpoints and nearby public receptors. As discussed later in the summary, the Velma Gas Plant has on-site personnel trained in responding to an acid gas incident. Targa personnel would utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and have the necessary response equipment on-site to attempt to close off or kill the well release in less than 24 hours.  If an expert third-party response team were to become necessary, 24 hours may be required to kill the well.\n\n\n\nThe ARS for toxic substances at Velma Gas Plant involves a packer leak within the well bore of the acid gas injection well. Such a leak would cause the casing fluid to eventually drain out through the hole, allowing hydrogen sulfide to enter the well casing.  If the casing head at the surface had a hole or leak, then the hydrogen sulfide could be released to the atmosphere. It was assumed that this scenario would release approximately 416 lb/hr, or 9,986 lbs of hydrogen sulfide over a 24-hour period.    \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nTarga encourages its employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n\n\n1.

After successfully completing this training, a novice operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed by the novice during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on his or her own, he or she is allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years, or more frequently upon request.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\n\n\nF. Contractors\n\n\n\nThe Velma Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\n\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\n\n6. Inform facility personnel of any hazard that they find during their work\n\n\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n\n\n1. A process overview\n\n2. Information about safety and health hazards\n\n3. Emergency Action Plan requirements\n\n4. Safe work practices before beginning work\n\n\n\nIn addition, Velma Ga"

There have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site; and no known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damages during this period.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY REPSONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nVelma Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation. Also included in the plan is the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. Specifically, the Velma Gas Plant has trained personnel for being the primary responders to an acid gas release. The plant also has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office) for a release that is outside the plant's response capabilities (i.e. responding to a "
