      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company's Grand Forks facility is part of the Simplot Food Group.  The Grand Forks facility processes raw potatoes into frozen french fries and other frozen potato products.  The Simplot Food Group turns out approximately two billion pounds of frozen french fries and other frozen potato products per year at six facilities in the U.S.  The frozen potato products are predominantly for the food service industry.  Potato processing requires raw potatoes to be cleaned, peeled, cut to size, blanched, dried, fried, frozen, packaged and then placed in frozen storage.  The cooling system uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program regulations 40 CFR Part 68, require facilities that have regulated substances above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program.  EPA also requires these facilities to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to EPA describing the source's risk management program.  The original deadline for submitting RMPs to EPA was June 21, 1999.  The chemical accident prevention regulations also require affected facilities to fully update and resubmit their RMPs to EPA by June 21, 2004.  The J.R. Simplot Grand Forks plant maintains quantities of anhydrous ammonia above the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and as such is subject to the requirements of Program 3 in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe elements of the RMP are listed below:\n\nHazard Assessment - Assess the potential impacts of worst-case and alternative release scenarios and compile a 5-year accident history.\n\nPrevention Program - Implement a comprehensive management program that affects a wide variety of operation, training, and maintenance activities.  The requirements of the prevention program are identical to OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard which the facility is also subject to.\n\nEmergency Response - Implement an emergency action program for the covered"

The original RMP was submitted to EPA by the June 21, 1999 deadline.  This updated RMP is to be resubmitted to EPA by June 21, 2004.\n\nThe information presented in the next section is intended to describe the elements of J.R. Simplot Grand Forks facility's Risk Management Program.  The format of the section corresponds to the executive summary data elements as dictated in 40 CFR Part 68 Executive Summary Section.  EPA's RMP*Submit 2004 User's Manual was used as a guidance document for explanation of the regulation's intent of how the Executive Summary is to be structured.  According to EPA's guidance, all discussions of the J.R. Simplot Company's Grand Forks facility's Off-site Consequence Analyses have been removed from the Executive Summary.\n \nExecutive Summary Data Elements\n\nAccording to EPA guidance the executive summary must include a brief description of the facility's Risk Management Program.  The following sections list each of the required executive summary data elements by rule citation.  \n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\nThe J.R. Simplot company has operated the Grand Forks facility since 1981; however, the plant has been in operation since the late 1950's.  The cooling system at the Grand Forks facility was remodeled in 1986.  The safety features of the system continue to be re-evaluated and improved.  In 2001, ammonia detectors were installed to meet the requirements of the PHA.  The additional detection probes were integrated into the plant's computer operating system to allow monitoring of the ammonia leak detectors on a plant wide basis. The facility has had a  successful operating record.\n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and the Substance Handled.\nPotato processing requires raw potatoes to be cleaned, peeled, cut"

The facility operates four process lines each with cooling system components.  In addition to the cooling systems associated with each process line, the facility operates large freezers for product freezing and storage.  \n\n68.155(d) Accidental Release Prevention Program.\nThe Prevention Program required for compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 for Program 3 processes is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA Process Safety Management.  J.R. Simplot Company aligned its prevention program with OSHA in 1994. J.R. Simplot took the opportunity to revalidate their existing prevention program during the development of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n68.155(e) Five-year Accident History.\nNo accidents, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), have occurred at this facility in the previous five years.\n\n68.155(f) Emergency Response Program.\nThe emergency response program established by the J.R. Simplot Company does not require personnel to act as the site incident commander.  In the case of an incident the Grand Forks Fire Department becomes the incident commander and assumes the role of directing response activities including any community emergency evacuation measures.  Fire department staff train at the facility on an annual basis. \n\n68.155(g) Safety Improvements.\nJ.R. Simplot is currently on-track with its evaluation and implementation of the recommendations from a Process Safety Management (PSM) audit that was completed in October 2001.  The five-year Process Hazard Analysis audit is due in the fall of 2004 along with the three-year PSM audit.  Finally, the Grand Forks facility is planning facility-wide evacuation training in the coming months; this training will be repeated on an annual basis after that.\n\n \nConclusion\n\nAs part of J.R.
