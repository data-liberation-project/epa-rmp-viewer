Shasta has one anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonia from the tank is used in Shasta's air pollution control for nitrogen oxides.  The tank size is 12,000 gal but is filled to no more than 10,200 gals.\nThe ammonia processe at Shasta is subject to OSHA 1910 requirements for Process Safety Management.  Compliance with the 1910 requirements as supplemented by the RMP specific requirements are the basis for the Shasta's accidental release prevention program for ammonia.\nThe response program includes notification of the appropriate County Agencies and they are they are the responding agency for any release.\n    \n\n(b) The stationary source and the regulated substance handled:\n\nRESPONSE:    Wheelabrator solid waste combustion facility that that converts biomass fuels into electrical energy.  The sole regulated substance subject to the RMP requirements is ammonia as used in (a) above.\n\n\n(c) The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s) including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n\nRESPONSE:     The worst case release scenario is the full release of the on-site tank.  Since the tank is limited to a maximum storage capacity of 10,200. This is the worst case modeled for the RMP.
