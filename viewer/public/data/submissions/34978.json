Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn our Horizon Milling, LLC, Chattanooga, Tennessee facility, we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by United States Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as in our milling process also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response procedures include notification of the local fire authority, who in turn would notify any potentially affected neighbors.  In addition, access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  Our chlorine system is enclosed within our building to help keep it secure.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to convert wheat into flour.  Chlorine is used in our process to whiten the flour and provide special baking properties that our clients like for their breads, muffins, cakes, etc. they make.  Chlorine is received by truck (transports) and is stored inside our flour mill.  The storage capacity of each cylinder vessel is 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  We have a total capacity for four cylinders; therefore the maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at our plant is approximately 8,000 pounds.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facili"

      "SummaryText": "ty complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations including OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices to provide a safe system for our employees as well as our neighbors and environment.  Our delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained in regard to chlorine hazards and emergency response.  Our employees watch the delivery of each truck bringing chlorine to our site.  In addition, we contract out to chlorine system professionals to periodically inspect our chlorine system, and make any necessary adjustments to either equipment or procedures to continue to ensure safe handling and use of chlorine.\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\nSince June 21, 1998, there have been no accidental releases or environmental damage resulting from our chlorine system.  There was 1 medical aid accident on 3/20/2000 for inhaling chlorine gas when improperly shutting down the system.  The employee was retrained and returned for duty with no lost time.\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the management system we have in place and the appropriate discovery and notification procedures to ensure coordination with our local emergency responders.  We have discussed this program with the Chattanooga Fire Department.  A representative of the Chattanooga Fire Department visited this plant in June 7th of 2000.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nA hazard review of our chlorine system was conducted on May 6, 2004.  From this review, the recommendations were:\n\n ? Document relief valve design conditions (flow rate and relief pressure)\n\n ? Put screen on relief valve discharge\n\n ? Study method of advanced warning for heat build-up near tanks\n\n ? Develop methods for preventing introduction of combustible materials into room\n\n ? Install check valve in 1\" chlorine line"
