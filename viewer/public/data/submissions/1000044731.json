Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAll operations employees of the wastewater treatment plant are required to be trained in the proper handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide tanks and feed systems, and emergency response contact policies, in a timely fashion following their employment at the facility. Refresher training will be received on an annual basis thereafter.\n\n\n\nAs an outside agency, Logansport Fire Department is to be notified in the event of a potential or actual release of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide at the facility. The Fire Department will be responsible for any necessary notifications of the public and/or trained and equipped hazardous materials responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance(s)\n\n\n\nThe Logansport Municipal Utilities, which owns and operates a wastewater treatment plant in Logansport, Indiana, uses Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide stored in 2,000-pound cylinder tanks.  \n\n\n\nGases from Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are drawn from tanks using a low-pressure water induction system for injection at various points in the wastewater treatment process.\n\n\n\nA maximum of five (5) 2,000-pound tanks of Chlorine are on hand at any time, for a total quantity of 10,000 pounds of Chlorine at most.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, no more than five (5) 2,000-pound tanks of Sulfur Dioxide are on hand at any time, for a maximum total quantity of 10,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario  --- Chlorine\n\n\n\nAt this plant, the worst-case scenario is the rupture of one (1) cylinder tank containing 2,000 pounds of Chlorine.\n\n\n\nUnder this scenario, the contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Chlorine gas at a rate of 200 pounds per minute over a period of ten (10) minutes.  The total quantity released would be 2,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at 0.9 miles (4,752 feet) using RMP"

Alternative Case Scenario --- Chlorine\n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario would involve a portion of the contents of the cylinder tank being released as Chlorine gas at a rate of two (2) pounds per minute over a period of 30 minutes, with the total quantity released being 60 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at 0.1 miles (528 feet) using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Worst-Case Scenario  --- Sulfur Dioxide\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the worst-case scenario is the rupture of one cylinder tank containing 2,000 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide.\n\n\n\nThe cylinder tank?s contents would be released as Sulfur Dioxide gas at a rate of 200 pounds per minute over a period of ten (10) minutes with the quantity released totaling 2,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at 0.9 miles (4,752 feet) using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Alternative Case Scenario --- Sulfur Dioxide\n\n\n\nUnder another scenario, a portion of the contents of the cylinder tank would be released as Sulfur Dioxide gas at a rate of two (2) pounds per minute over a period of 30 minutes.  The total quantity released would be 60 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe distance to toxic endpoint is calculated at 0.1 miles (528 feet) using RMP Comp as the modeling calculation tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe program to prevent accidental release is based upon a combination of management practices and low-pressure vacuum feeders specifically designed for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide gases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Five-Year Accident History  --- Chlorine\n\n\n\nNo accidental releases of Chlorine gas have occurred in the past five (5) years at the Logansport Municipal Utilities Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n\n\n\n\n\n9. Five-Year Accident History  --- Sulfur Dioxide\n\n\n\nLikewise, the Logansport Municipal Utilities Wastewater Treatment Plant has had no accidental releases of Sulfur Dioxide gas "

However, emergency issues have been coordinated with the Logansport Fire Department and the Cass County, Indiana, Office of Emergency Management. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.
