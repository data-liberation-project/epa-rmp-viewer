Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate a change. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are notified of changes and, if necessary trained on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEDNF promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the causes, and develop corrective actions for the prevention of the same or a similar incident. Findings and recommendations are documented and are forwarded to facility management for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEDNF periodically conducts audits to determine the implementation of the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. An audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until resolution. The resolution of each finding is documented. The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\nHazards in the processes are continually managed to ensure safe operations. The existing safety features to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility are described below.

The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEDNF has practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment at the facility. The aspects of this program include: (1) training; (2) written procedures; (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified equipment deficiencies; and (5) applying quality assurance measures. These activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the processes. \n\nSafe Work Practices\nEDNF has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and safety.

Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of facility personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and may include third parties. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed. Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years unless review is warranted sooner due to a significant change at the facility. Once again, the reviews are documented and records of the review are retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as (1) initial startup; (2) normal operations; (3) temporary operations; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) emergency operations; (6) normal shutdown; and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.
