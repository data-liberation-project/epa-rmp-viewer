A Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented at the facility as outlined in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. . Along with (PSM), the prevention program includes continual computor monitoring of the closed loop system and daily maintenance checks and services including periodic reviews. The system will shut itself down in most cases if a leak occurs. We have mechanics who have been trained to operate and maintain the system. We have an agreement with the City of Hickory and the Caldwell County Emergency Management System to support us in case of fire or a Ammonia leak. Emergency operation plans are developed to guide us in case of a leak. The City of Hickory Fire Dept. has been through our facility and is familiar with our systems in place.",

We sell and distribute grocery, frozen, perishable food and other related items to grocery stores and other retail locations. The refrigeration system in the warehouse's perishable and frozen food departments contains 44,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in holding tanks and associated piping, valves, compressors and other apparatus. There are no other covered processes at the warehouse that involve regulated substances in amounts that exceed the designated threshold qauntities.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  This facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29CFR 1910.119) as it applies to our refrigeration system and it is our policy to adhere to all other applicable federal, state and local laws. In the unlikely event an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia occurs, it is our policy to activate the Company Emergency Response Plan and coordinate with and assist the Hickory Fire Department's Hazmat Team and Caldwell County's Emergency Management System in responding to the emergency.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario/Alternate Release Scenario:  Ourworst-case release scenario involves the total failure of the warehouse's refrigeration and associated spill prevention systems allowing the release of 44,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off site and public receptors would be within the distance to the endpoint. However, the design features of the refrigeration system and associated spill prevention sustems and the facility's operating procedures make such a total failure extremely unlikely. Our alternative release scenario is a break in a refrigeration pipe that would lead to a 10-minute releaseof gas/vapor. In this scenario, the resulting distance to the endpoint does not extend off-site and there would be no public receptors within th"
