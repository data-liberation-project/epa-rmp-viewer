The following information summarizes the OCA that was performed. \n\n3.1  H2 - Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for hydrogen involves the rupture of one of our two new low temperature liquid hydrogen storage tanks.  This analysis is based on (1) a release of the entire tank's contents over a 10 minute period of time and (2) a vapor cloud explosion.  FSC did not take credit for any passive mitigation system when performing this analysis.  The distance estimated by RMP*Comp to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint includes offsite public receptors but no environmental receptors.  The estimated endpoint distance and specific public receptors affected are detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.   \n\n3.2  H2 - Alternative-case Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative-case release scenario involves a release from a full storage tank of hydrogen (due to overfilling of the tank) through the 2-inch pressure relief valve on the tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Although a BOC and/or FSC employee would likely be able to quickly stop such a release, FSC conservatively assumed that the release would continue until the tank's internal pressure dropped to 0 psig.  In performing this analysis, FSC took no credit for any controls or mitigation systems.  The distance estimated by RMP*Comp to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint includes offsite public receptors but no environmental receptors.  The estimated endpoint distance and specific public receptors are detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.\n\n3.3  HCL - Worst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a rupture of one of seven hydrogen chloride storage tubes on a tube trailer.  This analysis is based on (1) the storage tube being full at the time of the release, and (2) all HCL being released and vaporized in a 10-minute time period.

The estimated endpoint distance and specific public receptors affected are detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.  \n\n3.4  HCL - Alternative-case Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative-case release scenario for HCL involves a rupture of the supply header from the tube trailer downstream of a restricting orifice (0.80 inch).  Although the release rate will decline as the internal pressure of the HCL tube drops, FSC conservatively assumed that the release would continue at the same rate.  Although a FSC employee would likely be able to quickly stop such a release, FSC conservatively assumed that the release would continue until the HCL tube is empty.  While this release is most likely to occur inside the ventilated building containing the HCL tube trailer, FSC did not take credit for this mitigation system when performing the alternative-case release analysis since they did not believe the building met the criteria provided in RMP*Comp (i.e., a release into a building or shed with opening to the outside).  FSC also did not take credit for any other controls or mitigation systems when performing the alternative-case release scenario analysis for HCL.  The distance estimated by RMP*Comp to the toxic endpoint includes offsite public receptors but no environmental receptors.  The estimated endpoint distance and specific public receptors affected are detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.   \n\n3.5 TCS - Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the rupture of a full TCS ISO container.

The alternative-case release scenarios that were analyzed by FSC will provide emergency responders with information that should help them to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe primary reason for performing the OCA was to determine the offsite areas within which adverse effects to people and the environment could occur due to an accidental release.  Should such releases occur, we would expect the following:\n\n\u00b7 H2 releases - A release of hydrogen could expose personnel to fire and/or explosion hazards.  Any hydrogen released from our process would rise rapidly and mix with the atmosphere, thus greatly reducing the size of the affected area (called the endpoint distance) exposed to fire.  Explosion hazards to which personnel in the affected area could be exposed include flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  \n\n\u00b7 HCL releases - For exposures to HCL, most people at the outer edge of the affected areas would likely be able to walk away from an exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible could experience more serious effects.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would likely be more severe; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would likely be less severe.\n\n\u00b7 TCS releases - In performing the OCA, it was determined that the effects of a worst-case release scenario for TCS will extend only slightly beyond FSC's property line, but will not encompass any offsite public receptors.  Therefore, offsite effects due to TCS releases should be minimal. \n\nFSC used the most recent version (version 1.07) of EPA's RMP*Comp software to perform its OCA, and also compared the results to those obtained by using EPA's RMP Offsite C"

The estimated endpoint distance is detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.   \n\n3.6  TCS - Alternative-case Release Scenario\n\nThe selected alternative-case release scenario involves a rupture of the 0.5-inch supply header from the ISO container leading to a pool fire.  Although a FSC employee would likely be able to quickly stop such a release, FSC conservatively assumed that the release would continue until the TCS ISO container was empty.  FSC took credit for passive mitigation (i.e., a dike) but did not take credit for any active mitigation systems when performing this analysis.  The distance estimated by RMP*Comp to the 5 kilowatt/square meter heat radiation endpoint does not include any offsite public or environmental receptors.  The estimated endpoint distance is detailed in FSC's OCA documentation.   \n\nIn summary, because the analysis of worst-case release scenarios for both H2 and HCL indicates that offsite public receptors could be affected, and since all three of the regulated substances in our integrated circuit manufacturing process are covered under OSHA's PSM standard, the integrated circuit manufacturing process qualifies as a RMP Program Level 3 process.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe have always believed that employee and process safety are our highest priorities and we've integrated this belief into the ways that we do business on a daily basis.  When we increased the onsite inventories of H2, HCL, and TCS and exceeded the threshold quantities specified by OSHA's PSM regulation and EPA's RMP rule, FSC's safety and process safety programs had been upgraded and were in full compliance with both of these regulations.  Although the prevention program requirements of the RMP rule are nearly identical to those of the PSM regulation, the following sections"

Our accident prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n4.1.1 Process safety information.  FSC has established a PSM Filing System that resides in our online Documentum system.  The PSM Filing System contains all RMP-required records by either (1) containing an electronic version of the record, (2) referencing the location within the facility where the printed record exists, or (3) providing an electronic link to the record.  The PSI documentation in our PSM Filing System includes (but is not limited to) information about (a) the chemicals in our covered process, (b) the technology of our covered process (e.g., process chemistry, safe limits and the consequences of exceeding the limits, maximum chemical inventories), and (c) the equipment in our covered process (e.g., specifications, design codes and standards, relief systems, ventilation systems, engineering drawings).   We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n4.1.2. Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update the process hazard analyses performed for our covered process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  To perform a process hazard analysis, a multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Each team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The teams systematically address the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the process areas. Each team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.

Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures/specifications to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely and properly performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\u00b7 Steps for safely conducting activities\n\u00b7 Applicable process operating information, such as safe operating limits and the consequences of process deviations\n\u00b7 Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous chemical occurs\n\n4.1.4. Training.  We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training (performed as a part of our annual operator re-certification process) that covers (a) a general overview of the process, (b) the properties and hazards of the chemicals in the process, and (c) a detailed review of applicable operating procedures and safe work practices.  Written testing, observation, and/or demonstration are performed as appropriate to verify that employees understand the training material, and records of this training and the means used to verify understanding are maintained.\n\n4.1.5.

We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that changes do not adversely affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with another valve of identical specifications) must be approved through the management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are informed/trained on the changes.\n\n4.1.7. Pre-startup safety review.  We recognize that new or newly modified are historically more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of any new or modified process before placing it into service to help ensure its safe operation.  This review confirms that:\n\n\u00b7 Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\u00b7 Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\n\u00b7 Employee training has been completed\n\u00b7 For a covered process, a process hazard analysis has been performed if the process is new, or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\n\n4.1.8. Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is performing thorough assessments on a regular basis.  We plan to audit our covered process at least every 3 years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  To conduct an audit, we will assemble a team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations and in our covered process.  The team will evaluate whether our prevention program satisfies the requirements of the PSM and RMP regulations and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure"

We investigate all incidents that have or could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident potentially having such effects.  When an incident is reported, we assemble an investigation team and initiate the investigation as soon as possible, and at least within 48 hours of the incident. Investigation results are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n4.1.10. Employee participation.  We have a written employee participation plan that summarizes the actions we've taken and are continuing to take to involve our workers in our PSM and RMP-related activities.  We believe involving our workers greatly improves our efforts and helps to ensure that their safety concerns are addressed.  We encourage active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities for the covered process.  Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of our accidental release prevention program, and have easy access to all PSM and RMP-related records.\n\n4.1.11. Hot work permits.  We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with those requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the designated FSC employee reviews the completed form and the work area before work can begin.  Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices"

Five-year Accident History\n\nFollowing a thorough review and guidance from a consulting firm specializing in the areas of PSM/RMP regulatory compliance, FSC determined that the RMP rule requirement to compile a five-year accident history did not apply to FSC when we submitted our initial RMPlans to EPA.  We could not have had a release from an RMP-covered process prior to increasing the inventories of H2, HCL, and TCS since it was the inventory increases that first triggered RMP-coverage.  Prior to the addition of the bulk chemical delivery systems, HCL and TCS were supplied from cylinders and H2 was supplied from a single storage tank.  The onsite inventory for each of these regulated substances was less than the respective RMP-listed threshold quantity. \n\nFSC will maintain a five-year accident history to document any future accidental releases meeting the specified criteria, and the documentation will include all required data.\n\n6.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and integrating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  An important part of our approach to process safety management is a risk management program (RMP) that helps us (a) manage the risks associated with using hazardous chemicals at our facility and (b) comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions: Risk Management Regulation (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at FSC.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\u00b7 A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last 5 years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see Sections 3 and 5 of this executive summary\n\n\u00b7 A prevention program to help safely maintain and operate any process that contains a sufficient quantity of RMP-listed regulated substances such that the process is covered by the RMP rule - see Section 4 of this executive summary\n\n\u00b7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see Section 6 of this executive summary\n\nHowever, the risk management program is but one part of FSC's comprehensive safety program within which we have developed and implemented multiple levels of safeguards against accidental r"

When we must use a hazardous chemical, we consider the potential for this chemical to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n\u00b7 Preventing releases of hazardous chemicals.  When a hazardous chemical is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, maintained and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government codes, standards, and good practices are closely adhered to in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the equipment.\n\n\u00b7 Limiting damage from a potential release.  Process safety is integrated into all FSC activities, with the intention of preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  However, we have trained our workforce to quickly recognize accidental releases and have organized and trained an emergency response team to quickly assess the severity of a release and respond to stop and to mitigate the release. We work closely with the Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency and City of South Portland Fire Department to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of a release on our workers and the community.  \n\nOur overall safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

Regulated Substances Onsite\n\nFSC has one process, the integrated circuit manufacturing process, which uses three RMP-listed regulated substances, each of which is in an inventory greater than the respective threshold quantity specified in the RMP rule.  These three regulated substances are hydrogen (H2), a flammable gas; hydrogen chloride (HCL), a toxic gas; and trichlorosilane (TCS), a flammable liquid.\n\nFSC's RMP covered process consists of (1) new bulk chemical delivery systems for HCL and TCS that are designed, installed, owned, operated, and maintained by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\n\nWe performed the OCA to estimate the potential for accidental releases of H2, HCL, and TCS to affect the public or the environment. We evaluated one worst-case release scenario for HCL since it is our only regulated toxic substance.  We also evaluated one worst-case release scenario each for H2 and TCS to ensure that the scenario documented in the RMPlan represents the greatest estimated distance to an endpoint.  Similarly, we also analyzed alternative-case release scenarios for each of these regulated substances to ensure that the scenarios documented in the RMPlan represent the greatest estimated distances to the endpoints.  The alternative-case release scenarios modeled were all more reasonable than the worst-case release scenarios but were all considered unlikely to occur due to our having thoroughly integrated process safety concerns into the design, fabrication, installation, and the ongoing operation and maintenance of the covered process.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.
