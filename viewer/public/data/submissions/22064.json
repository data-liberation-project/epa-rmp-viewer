The principal fuels produced are gasoline and diesel.  The refinery produces propane and butane for commercial purposes.  In addition, the refinery produces anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur for the agricultural market, as well as petroleum coke used for fuel in cogeneration plants.  The refinery accomplishes the production of these products from crude oil through the use of many complex processing units.  The refinery principally processes San Joaquin Valley Crudes and Alaskan North Slope Crude.  Oil must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels.  In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce less smog upon combustion by cars and trucks.  \n\n\n\nCrude oil begins its journey through the refinery at the Crude Units.  Desalters dehydrate the oil and electrically remove salts to reduce the corrosivity.  It is then sent to the distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight.  Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons.  The distillation tower produces six fractions:  wet gas/butanes, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil and resid.  The heaviest component, resid, is sent to the Feed Prep units for further distillation under vacuum.  After vacuum distillation, the Feed Prep bottom product, which is made up of very heavy hydrocarbons and is a solid at ambient temperature, is sent to the Coker.  The Coker thermally cracks large molecules into smaller ones.  These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels.  The Coker also produces petr"

These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and/or the Hydrocracker Unit.  Both of these units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of a catalyst.  Catalytic cracking is more selective than thermal cracking.  The FCCU cracking breaks long chain hydrocarbons into short chains and multi-ring compounds into smaller ring compounds.  In addition, olefin compounds (unsaturated hydrocarbons) are generated.  Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of smog during engine combustion.  The olefins are removed by other process units.  The cracking process in the Hydrocracker occurs in the presence of Hydrogen gas.  Any olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during the hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds.  \n\n\n\nThe Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) units remove sulfur and nitrogen from their feedstocks, creating Hydrogen Sulfide and Ammonia, which are separated and processed elsewhere.  These units also saturate olefins.  The HDS units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning gasoline, since the removal of these compounds is critical to preventing smog from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel.  The Hydrodearomatization (HDA) unit removes aromatic compounds from diesel fractions, a necessary step in production of cleaner burning fuels.  The Butadiene plant saturates the Butadiene (another olefin) generated by the Coker.  The Reformer Units rearrange hydrocarbons from straight chains into branched chains, rings and aromatics; these are desirable compounds because they raise the octane number of the motor fuels.  Aromatic compounds created by the Reforming units are saturated in the Benzene Saturation Unit"

The Alkylation Unit combines two small molecules, a branched hydrocarbon and an olefin, to make a larger branched hydrocarbon.  This process generates alkylate, a high octane blending component for gasoline.  The Alkylation Unit uses Sulfuric Acid as a catalyst.  The MTBE plant produces MTBE from an olefin and Methanol; MTBE is used as an oxygenate in fuel.  \n\n\n\nThe cracking processes produce very small hydrocarbons as well as the larger fractions discussed above.  The Gas Plants and the Light Hydrocarbon Processor (LHP) purify these compounds.  The smallest molecules (one and two carbons) are used in the refinery for fuel.  The propanes and butanes are used as feedstocks for the Alkylation process and for commercial sale.  \n\n\n\nThe refinery has several boilers that produce high pressure, high temperature steam, which is used for both heating and cooling various processes.  The Water Treatment Plants (WTP) produce high quality water for use in the boilers and process cooling systems.  The API Separator and the Waste Water Treatment (WWT) plant are part of the refinery's waste water treatment system.  The water that is removed from crude oil prior to processing and water from other process stages is treated by separation and biological conversion systems prior to its permitted discharge.  \n\n\n\nThe sulfur and nitrogen removed from processing streams is converted into anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur at the Chemical Plant.  The Chemical Plant actually consists of five units, the Ammonia Recovery Unit (ARU), Acid Plant, Diethanolamine (DEA) Stripping Unit, Sulfur Recovery Unit (SRU) and a Shell Claus Offgas Treating (SCOT) Unit.  The ARU removes Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide from refinery sour water streams.  The Ammonia is then purified for agricultural purposes, while the Hydrogen Sulfide is sent to the SRU.

The SCOT plant receives and treats sulfur-containing tailgas from the SRU, converts the sulfur containing compounds to Hydrogen Sulfide and returns the stream to the SRU for reprocessing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nMost of the regulated substances handled at the refinery regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are flammables.  These materials range in flammability from Pentane (with a flash point greater than -40( F) to Hydrogen (with a flash point of -100( F).  Larger flash points indicate less flammability.  Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions involving these compounds.  For comparison, gasoline has a flash point of -45( F and diesel fuel has a flash point of 125( F.  Propane and Butane are flammable gasses with flash points lower than gasoline. \n\n\n\nAs part of refining crude oil to motor fuels, other regulated substances are generated in addition to the flammables.  The four materials discussed here are hazardous principally through inhalation.  Hydrogen Sulfide, with its characteristic rotten egg odor, is created in the processing units that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the refining streams.  Hydrogen Sulfide is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas; its odor can be readily detected at concentrations below concern.  Hydrogen Sulfide is not stored at the refinery.  As soon as it is generated, it is immediately sent to the Chemical Plant for processing into elemental Sulfur or Sulfuric Acid.  Ammonia is also created by the same processing units.  Ammonia is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas with a sharp irritating odor.  Its odor is also readily detectable at concentrations below concern.

Sulfur Dioxide's odor also allows it to be detected at low concentrations.  Sulfur Dioxide is not stored at the Chemical Plant; it is an intermediate in the Sulfuric Acid recycling process.  Oleum is concentrated Sulfuric Acid with Sulfur Trioxide dissolved in it, hence its nickname \"Fuming Sulfuric Acid\".  Oleum has potential to liberate Sulfur Trioxide, which is a toxic gas with a sharp penetrating odor.  Oleum is a product of the Sulfuric Acid recycling process.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe refinery has both Program Level 1 and Program Level 3 Covered Processes as defined by EPA's RMP regulation.  A Program Level 1 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance and the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) does not go offsite.  A Program Level 3 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance and the WCS reaches an offsite receptor.  A Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is a hypothetical event and the parameters for calculating the WCS is defined in the regulations.  For calculation purposes, it is assumed that the entire contents of the regulated substance in the largest container is released.  For Flammable scenarios, it is assumed all the material explodes.  For Toxic scenarios, it is assumed that the whole container is released within a ten minute period.  Based on these mathematical assumptions, a distance can be calculated for the WCS.  \n\n\n\nProgram Level 1 Processes:\n\n\n\nThe refinery has 15 Covered Processes classified as Program Level 1 processes.  Each process contains a mixture of flammables as the regulated substance.  The WCS for each Program Level 1 process was calculated using RMPComp to determine the distance the explosion force could travel.  The WCS endpoint "

To use RMPComp to calculate the WCS endpoint, any of the following flammable substances, Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, or Pentane, can be used to model a flammable mixture.  Since their heats of combustion are relatively close, they all provide the same distance to the endpoint.  As required, no passive mitigation measures are considered. \n\n\n\nProgram Level 3 Processes, Worst Case Scenarios:\n\n\n\nThe refinery has 5 Covered Processes classified as Program Level 3 processes.  Two WCS are required to be reported for Program Level 3 processes, one flammable and one toxic.  The largest WCS was selected according to regulatory requirements for the flammable and toxic scenarios.  The toxic WCS for the refinery involves anhydrous Ammonia.  The scenario is a complete failure of the storage tank releasing its entire contents of Ammonia.  The scenario was modeled using RMP Comp.  The concentration of Ammonia at the endpoint is 200 parts per million, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline-2 (ERPG-2) level for this compound.  The flammable WCS for the Refinery involves Butane.  The scenario is a complete failure of a Butane storage tank.  The WCS endpoint used for an explosion is 1 psi overpressure.  RMP Comp was used to perform the calculations. As required, no passive mitigation measures were included in either set of calculations.\n\n\n\nProgram Level 3 Processes, Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation requires the calculation of Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS).  Unlike the WCS, the ARS calculations allow consideration of active safety measures in addition to passive safety measures.  One ARS is determined for each regulated substance at the refinery.  There is an ARS for flammables, anhydrous Ammonia, and Oleum (Sulfur Trioxide).

The PSI program addresses the written requirements for chemical hazards by using Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  The MSDSs contain the required information regarding chemical toxicity, Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL), physical data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, reactivity data and the hazardous effects of incompatible mixtures.  In addition to the MSDSs, the refinery has Hazardous Material Warning Sheets (HMWS) prepared for each vessel in the refinery.  The HMWS is a one-page summary of the potental chemical hazards from the materials contained within the vessel.

A HAZOP is a detailed review of the process in a systematic fashion to determine whether process deviations can lead to undesirable consequences.  Detailed PSI is required to perform a HAZOP, since the review process proceeds line-by-line through the processing unit.  The team lists potential causes and consequences of deviation as well as existing safeguards protecting against the deviation.  When the team finds that an inadequate protection exists for a credible deviation, then recommendations are developed to enhance safeguards.  The What-If methodology is a brainstorming approach about possible undesired events.  It is not as structured as the HAZOP, but allows for process safety concerns to be brought forward in a less rigid approach.  The Checklist methodology consists of a written list of items or procedural steps to verify the status of a system.  Development of generic hazard checklists allows this method to be used in combination with other PHA methods.  The use of these three methodologies together increases the probability of discovering hazards.  \n\n\n\nEach PHA performed systematically examines potential deviations and their consequences.  Examples of some of the deviations examined include:  no flow, less flow, more flow, reverse flow, wrong concentrations, contamination of flow, misdirected flow, low temperature, high temperature, low pressure, high pressure, low levels, high levels, start-up and shutdown, leaks/rupture, mechanical seal damage, exchanger tube leaks, corrosion/erosion, mixing concerns, human factors and instrumentation.

The purpose of the Hot Work program is to develop and implement consistent hot work practices and precautions to control tasks that may create sources of ignition.  The program also provides consistent planning and authorization of those tasks.  The Hot Work program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because it provides a consistent methodology to address prevention of fires that could potentially result from ignition producing work.  \n\n\n\nThe Hot Work Permitting Program applies to all equipment or tasks capable of generating energy sufficient to ignite flammable/combustible materials, vapors or gasses.  The equipment and tasks are divided into two categories, high energy and low energy. Some of the activities qualifying as low energy include the use of battery operated tools, grinding, chipping concrete and flash photography.  Some of the high energy tasks are gas or electric welding, pre or post weld heat treating, and abrasive blasting on storage tanks.  Whenever possible, employees and contractors are to move the job requiring Hot Work to the shop or weld bay to avoid performing this work in the process area.\n\n\n\nPrior to each Hot Work job, a permit must be completed.  The permit requires the following information to be filled out:  the date and time of job start, equipment identification, the type of work to be performed, classification of the hot work as low or high energy, a checklist for site preparation, a checklist for any PPE requirements, a checklist for emergency provisions, and atmospheric testing results.

Authorizing signatures for a low energy Hot Work permit include the responsible operator, the head operator, the craftsperson and a fire watch.  For a high energy permit, the responsible operator, the head operator, the craftsperson, the fire watch and the shift supervisor authorize the permit.  These signatures mean that the permit has been reviewed, the proper tests have been performed and that the job site is safe to allow work to proceed.  If additional personnel are required for the job, each of them must also review and sign the permit.  Upon completion of the job, the responsible operator and the craftsperson review the site to ensure that it has been left clean and in a safe condition.  Once the Hot Work is complete, copies of the permits are retained for two years.\n\n\n\nHot Work permits are good from the start time listed on the permit until 7 AM.
