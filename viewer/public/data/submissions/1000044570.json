EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Rumford Paper Company operates a paper manufacturing facility located at 35 Hartford Street, Rumford, Maine that manufactures coated paper and market pulp. The area immediately surrounding the plant is primarily rural with just a few commercial facilities and residential areas. The Androscoggin River is the closest water body and is directly adjacent to the plant. The major routes serving the facility include U.S. Route 2 and Maine Route 108.\n\nThe only process at the Rumford Paper Company facility covered by RMP is the chlorine dioxide process which involves the manufacture, storage, and distribution of a 1.2% solution of chlorine dioxide. Specifically the chlorine dioxide process is subject to RMP's Prevention Program 3. Based on a review of chemicals present at the plant, there are no other substances that are covered by RMP.\n\nPursuant to the RMP rule, owners must include a five-year accident history that identifies all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in: (1) deaths, OSHA reportable injuries, or significant property damage on-site; or (2) known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. See 40 C.F.R. !? 68.42. A review was completed for all existing RMP covered chemical release/spill records and incident investigation reports dating back to June 2009. No accidental releases from covered processes at the mill meeting the criteria described above have occurred within the past five years.\n\nThe Rumford Paper Company is committed to the safety and health of Rumford workers and the public, preservation of the environment, and prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The mill implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at Rumford; and programs to evaluate the "

The Rumford Paper Company provides response training to mill personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department and with the LEPC.\n\nThe Rumford Paper Company has established a written response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\nProviding proper first aid and medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances (The Rumford Paper Company has emergency responders and/or Medical staff on site at all times.)\n\nControlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of response equipment\n\nInspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n\nReviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\nTraining response teams (HAZMAT, Rescue, Fire Brigade, and Security)\n\nThe Rumford Paper Company maintains emergency response teams trained in emergency response procedures. The emergency teams are a Pulp Mill HAZMAT Team, and an Emergency Response Team (which includes HAZMAT, Confined Space Rescue, Fire Brigade, Security Team and a Medical Staff).
