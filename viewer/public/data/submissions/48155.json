The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority Water Treatment Plant has one (1) regulated substance at the facility above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the water treatment process.  Chlorine is handled in one ton cylinders and the maximum amount of chlorine handled is currently 8,000 pounds with plans to increase chlorine to 10,000 pounds within  the coming year (2008).  The Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, indentified as \"worst case release\"  and \"alternative scenario\".  The worst case release scenario is defined by EPA as a release of the largest storage vessel over a ten (10) minute period due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release is defined bt EPA as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case release.  The Edgefied County W"

      "SummaryText": "ater & Sewer Authority chose DEGADIS+ to perform the air dispersion consequence modeling due to the nature of the chemical and the release scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority involves a catastrophic release from a one ton cylinder (2000 lb.) of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The worst case release was analyzed at Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, 106 degees F, 70% humidity and 0.25 m surface roughness for the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a fusible plug failure in a one ton cylinder (2000 lb.) of chlorine.  The failure released the entire contents of chlorine gaseous form.  The altrrnative release scenario was analyzed at Class D atmospheric stability, 3.0 m/s wind speed, 62.2 degrees F, 70% humidity and 0.25 m surface roughness for the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nThe alternative release is much more likely to occur at the facility than the worst case release scenario.  The worst case release is unrealistic because at that high of a release rate, the chlorine will most likely freeze over the hole in the container which will prohibit more chlorine gas from escaping.  It is not appropriate to compare a 10 minute release to a one hour exposure time standard.  The toxic endpoint concertration is based on a one hour exposure time, while the worst case release occurs over a ten minute period.  Therefore, the ten minute release period is used as the averaging time instead of the one hour exposure time.Realistically, if a person can withstand a certain concentration over a one hour period with no health effects, they could withstand a higher concentration over a ten minute period.  One solution would be to adjust the toxic endpoint value to correlate to the ten minute exposure during a worst case release instead of the one hour standard.  However, there is no"

The above existing reports have been reviewed and no adjustments were necessary.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nThe Edgefield County Water & sewer Authority has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidential release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance.  The following steps are keyed to the prevention program:\n1.  Detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards of chlorine,  process technology, and process equipment.\n2.  Comprehensive process hazard analysis is conducted to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluated.\n3.  Operating procedures have been developed and implemented which describe tasks to be preformed,  dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, emergency operating procedures and safety and health precautions to be taken.\n4.  An employee training program is in effect to ensure that the employees of the Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's Water Treatment Plant are properly trained and aware of all safety practices, hazards, emergency procedures and maintenance procedures.\n5.  An on-going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure safe process operation.\n6.  Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that all unplanned events affecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely manner to identify the causes of the incident and to implement corrective action.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's Water Treatment Plant has an excellent record of preventing accidential releases over the last five years.  Due to the effective release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN \nThe Edgefield County Water & Sewer Authority's Water Treatment"

This task was completed on December 1, 2005 by installing an Actec 35 chlorine analzer  and alarm system."
