The assumption is that a full one-ton container of chemical is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions as specified in the RMP regulation are also assumed to be present.  The release is also assumed to occur outdoors.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, the facility reviewed the consequences of a valve breaking off at the container connector during hookups inside the storage room.  No active mitigation was considered. The same scenario was assumed for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nResults of the off-site consequence analyses are described in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*Submit plan for the Las Vegas Street WWTP.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n7 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n7 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n7 Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions\n7 Training for each Las Vegas Street WWTP employee involved in operating the chlorine system\n7 Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment\n7 Managem"

The facility is also planning to install a sulfur dioxide chemical scrubber during the fall of 1999.  In the event of a release of sulfur dioxide in the storage room, the normal ventilation system will shut down and the sulfur dioxide-contaminated air will be sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber will be maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a sulfur dioxide release event. Management of Change procedures will be used for the upgrades to the sulfur dioxide system.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the City of Colorado Springs Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.

The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Las Vegas Street WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Las Vegas Street WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues."

      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Las Vegas Street Wastewater Treatment Plant (Las Vegas Street WWTP), one of several facilities owned and operated by the Colorado Springs Utilities (CSU).\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nCSU believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, CSU has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Correspondingly, CSU has determined to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements although it is eligible for the less comprehensive requirements of Program 2.  By doing so, CSU affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nCSU takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Las Vegas Street WWTP) and actively participated in compre"

They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nCSU management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, CSU has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Las Vegas Street WWTP is located at 825 Las Vegas Street in Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado.  The Las Vegas Street WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical, biological, and chemical treatment operations.  The facility provides service to over 300,000 people residing within a 150 square-mile area.  An average of 45 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater is treated daily;  the maximum treatment rate of the facility is 75 MGD (wet) or 65 MGD (dry).\n\nThe Las Vegas Street WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of sixteen containers (32,000 pounds) on site.  In addition, the Las Vegas Street WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of ten containers (20,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Las Vegas Street WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been deter"
