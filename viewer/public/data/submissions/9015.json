The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, management, and employees of Pawnee County (Dartmouth Branch) are committed\nto the prevention of any accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information.\n    -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n    -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n    -The maximum quantity stored would be 56,000  pounds in 1-12,000 gallon storage tank.  The\nmaximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 44,000 pounds.\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or\ntank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds,\nwhich represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design\nstandards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.63 miles.\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\npotential incident) is a release from a pop off valve.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to\n200 ppm) is .01 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standard"

The Five-year Accident History \n    a. There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n    - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n    - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place,\nproperty damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n    - The facility has:\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR         \n 1910.38;\n    b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know-\ninformation as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120\nincluding pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n    d. annually walk through with local emergency response team. 5-18-1999\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\nrecommendations for implementation at this time."
