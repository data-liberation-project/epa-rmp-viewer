The chlorine storage and dosing process is located within the perimeter of the facility, while the sulfur dioxide storage and dechlorination system is located remotely at the outfall to the Anclote River, approximately 850 feet north of the WWTP.\nThe chlorination system uses two (2) five hundred pound per day (500 ppd) chlorinators and one (1) two hundred pound per day (200 ppd) chlorinator to combine chlorine in its gaseous form with water, creating an aqueous chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is injected into the filtered effluent flow as the water enters the chlorine contact chamber.  The chlorine solution dose is determined using an ultrasonic meter that measures the flow of the filtered effluent.\nThe chlorine contact chamber serves to provide the detention time needed for effective disinfection.  Effluent flow from the contact chamber flows to an adjacent two million-gallon (2.0 MG) reuse water ground storage tank.  After the ground storage tank fills to its maximum capacity, the effluent level in the chlorine contact chamber increases until it overflows, or is automatically controlled by the facility\u00bfs Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, to a transmission pipe, which discharges at the Anclote River outfall.\nPrior to discharge to the Anclote River, the effluent is dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide. The dechlorination system uses one (1) five hundred pound per day (500 ppd) sulfunator and one (1) two hundred pound per day (200 ppd) sulfunator, combining sulfur dioxide in its gaseous form with water to create an aqueous sulfur dioxide solution.  The operation of the sulfunators is similar to that of the chlorinators.  The sulfur dioxide solution is dispensed just upstream of the Anclote River outfall weir.\nBoth the chlorination and dechlorination processes are subject to 40 CFR Part 68 Level 3 requirements for the following three reasons:  \n1.\tBoth processes store regulated"

The toxic chemical threshold quantities, which were met to identify the facility, relate to the stored amounts of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The ARP/RMP Act delineates three (3) specific levels of processes.  Of the three levels defined, the City\u00bfs WWF qualifies as a Level 3 Process facility.  As a result of this designation, the facility is required to address specific process safety criteria in the Risk Management Program.  This information and other pertinent information are included in the City\u00bfs RMP document.\nThe objective of the City of Tarpon Springs Risk Management Program (RMP) is to provide information that will define action(s) that will effectively prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment and mitigate the severity of any accidental releases that might occur.\nIn order to achieve these objectives, the Risk Management Program presents information for the City\u00bfs Level 3 processes and outlines the emergency response program for the facility.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\nThe City of Tarpon Springs takes a proactive approach to safety and compliance with all State and Federal rules and regulations.  Pertinent WWF staff members have completed comprehensive training courses related to the proper use, handling, storage, and emergency response procedures associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The City\u00bfs Risk Management Program specifically addresses staff activities for various scenarios related to potential leaks and emergency situations, while placing emphasis on predictive maintenance and preventing accidental chemical releases.

Access is limited to WWF staff members and authorized emergency personnel.  Entrance into the facility is accessed using programmed magnetic identification cards, which record the time and employee number of each entry into the facility.  The entry gate is monitored at two (2) locations within the control building using video surveillance equipment and an intercom system, which is used to grant or deny access to the facility.\nAdditionally, the City recently installed video surveillance equipment at the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage buildings and the chemical feed equipment areas.  Installation of this equipment has provided an effective means to monitor the storage buildings, ensuring authorized personnel are safe and providing notice of unauthorized persons in the areas.  The video monitoring also provides staff with additional ability to detect equipment malfunctions. \nThe facility entry gate, the chlorine and the sulfur dioxide storage buildings are monitored twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  Images of these locations are displayed on a designated monitor located in the operational control building and at a shared monitor located in the reception area and are recorded for forty-eight (48) hours.\nThe facility and the regulated substances handled\nThe City is permitted to operate a domestic wastewater treatment plant, permit #FL0030406, by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).
