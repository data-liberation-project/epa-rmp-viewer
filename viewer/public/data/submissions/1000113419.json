The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials. Perdue continues to train our associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conduct mock drills routinely. Perdue's officials have discussed the company's response program with our local LEPC and fire department representatives.\n\nAs part of our Risk Management Plan (RMP), Perdue Farms has developed an RMP Communications Plan. The goals of the plan are to:\n\n---Educate the public on the potential risks of regulated substances used by Perdue\n\n---Respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communication\n\n---Be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental release scenario\n\nProactive materials about disclosure information, how the company is prepared to deal with an incident, how the community should respond, and a process for announcing that an incident has occurred (to be used as needed) are being prepared. In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civil groups, media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel and the public in general will be available.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nAs part of Perdue Farms' continual improvement philosophy, the Perdue Gainesville facility continues to identify and update system components and techniques to ensure safety and quality."
