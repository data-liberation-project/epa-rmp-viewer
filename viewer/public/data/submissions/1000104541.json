The program includes: (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing written maintenance procedures, (3) conducting maintenance training, (4) performing and documenting inspections, (5) correcting identified equipment deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures to ensure replacement equipment meets the requirement specifications.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits\r\nCEC has a hot work permit program in place to ensure worker and process safety. The hot work permit program is designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the process area. These procedures (and others), along with the training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nCEC has a system in place to ensure safety concerns associated with changes to the ammonia process are reviewed and addressed prior to the change.

CEC is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity. As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the three combustion turbines, three heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) and three auxiliary boilers, anhydrous ammonia is in injected into the turbine exhaust streams. The anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in two storage tanks, located on the northwest side of the facility. The storage capacity of each tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability. There are not other toxic or flammable substances on site that exceed RMP thresholds. Passive mitigation exists in the form of a dike around the tank and active mitigation in the form of deluge, which limits the spread of ammonia.\r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\r\nAs required by the RMP rule, the worst case scenario is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks. The release duration is ten minutes. The 13,000 gallon tanks are each limited to 85% of the storage capacity by administrative controls, including operating procedures and high level alarms. The EPA's RMP*Comp was used in this analysis.  Based on the analysis, public and environmental receptors would be affected by the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario, although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst case scenario. It was analyzed as the failure of the pipe connection on a delivery tanker truck. The release would be mitigated via a water deluge system installed around the outside of the tank. The EPA's Risk Management Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used in the analysis. Based on the analysis, public receptors would not be affected by the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nCEC is subject to OSHA's PSM Standard and Program 3"

Each employee is urged to participate in the continual upgrading and maintaining of all health and safety programs. Employee involvement is achieved through direct participation on a voluntary basis, active consultation with affected employees, and representative participation in the process hazard analysis. Employees have access to all information as required under the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCEC maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner. These documents include information concerning the hazardous of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment. This information is updated when changes in the process occur. Information concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and stability data, and the effects of inadvertent mixing. Information concerning the process technology includes process flow information, process chemistry, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.
