The products produced include Anhydrous Ammonia, Urea (liquid and solid), Nitric acid, liquid Ammonium Nitrate solution, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN) solution, and liquid Carbon Dioxide.\r\n \r\nSince the Facility has more than 10,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, it is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  The Facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia. \r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE SAFETY PROGRAM: \r\nThe Facility's Safety Vision states: We, the employees of Rentech [Nitrogen], utilize teamwork, communication, and education, with the full support of management, to achieve safety excellence. The Facility utilizes this vision statement as a reminder of the priority of achieving safety excellence. Employees are highly involved in creating and implementing safety programs and safety systems at the facility, with a focus on continuous improvement. \r\n\r\nHighlights of the safety program include:\r\n\r\n\u00bfExtensive employee participation in the development, implementation, and review of safety systems and programs at the facility. All employees participate in an annual evaluation of the safety programs at the facility.\r\n\u00bfA well-developed, extensive training program that ensures that employees and contractors are knowledgeable on the safety programs and their job duties.\r\n\u00bfAn excellent emergency response team. Many of the employees on the emergency response team are also highly involved with the community volunteer fire and HazMat teams.\r\n\u00bfStrong community relations are an important part of the Facility's safety program. The Facility is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has representatives attend LEPC meetings on a regular basis.  \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Facility"

Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up-to-date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continual employee training. \r\n\r\nThe Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe facility also utilizes a comprehensive Incident Reporting and Incident Investigation program to determine root cause(s) and appropriate corrective action(s) for incidents that occur.  \r\n\r\nWell established mechanical integrity practices and procedures are in place to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems.  In addition, an established hot work permit procedure for fire prevention is in place to ensure all safety precautions are taken before any hot work is started in a non-designated hot work area.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has implemented a contractor safety program that includes procedures to hire and use contractors who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of facility or contractor employees.\r\n\r\nThe Facility personnel training program includes an overview of the plant processes, safety and health hazards, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices.\r\nThe"

      "SummaryText": "Facility has a comprehensive management of change and pre-startup safety review system in place to manage changes to the processes. This system requires that the process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised. Affected process safety information (chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information) and operating and maintenance procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, all affected personnel receive training on the change.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY: \r\n\r\nThe Facility has an excellent safety record with no fatalities (deaths) of personnel and contractors at the plant since it was constructed in 1965.  The Facility has not had an RMP reportable accident in the last five years.  We are confident that the policies and programs in place at our facility will help us to maintain our record in the years ahead. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: \r\n\r\nAn excellent emergency response team is in place at the Facility. Many of the employees on the emergency response team are also highly involved with the community volunteer fire and HazMat teams. Emergency response drills are held each year. In addition, the Facility emergency response team has responded to nearby incidents at the request of the community. \r\n\r\nApproximately twenty employees are on the Facility emergency response team. Training for these personnel is extensive. This training includes classroom instruction, hands on review of the equipment, and several incident simulation drills conducted each year. At least one of the incident simulation drills is conducted with the participation of local emergency responders.\r\nThe Facility's Emergency Contingency Plan covers accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics. The plan is reviewed, at least annually, with all employees.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: \r\n\r\nT"
