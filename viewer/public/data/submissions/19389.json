This compilation of written process safety information was to enable the facility and the employees involved in the operating process to identify and understand the hazards posed by the anhydrous ammonia systems. This process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.\n\nThe Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for the facility is 4931, \"Electric and Other Services Combined\". This includes establishments primarily engaged in providing electric services in combination with thermal production, with electric services as the major part, though less than 95% of the total.",

Calpine King City Cogeneration Facility closely coordinated with the Monterey County Department of Public Health to ensure that appropriate technical standards were applied in the implementation of these regulations.\n\n1.1  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy at Calpine King City Cogeneration Facility to minimize hazards to employees, the public, and the environment. The overall responsibility for the developement, implementation, and integration of the RMP rests with the Plant Manager of the Calpine Kng City Cogeneration Facility, Rick Colgan.\n\n1.2  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nThe Calpine King City Cogeneration Facility (Calpine) is a combined-cycle plant designed to produce both process steam for use in the adjacent Basic Vegetable Products (BVP) Facility, and electricity for sale to Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).\n\n1.3  AMMONIA SYSTEMS\n\nThe only regulated substance present at Calpine above the threshold planning quantity is anhydrous ammonia. The maximum amount on site at any one time would be equivalent to the maximum working capacity of the ammonia storage tank (9,386 gallons).\n\nThe ammonia systems are comprised of the ammonia supply system and the ammonia injection system. The ammonia supply system stores anhydrous ammonia, vaporizes the ammonia, and supplies the ammonia vapor to the ammonia injection system. The ammonia injection system receives ammonia vapor from the ammonia supply system, regulates the ammonia flow rate, dilutes the ammonia with air, and injects the dilute ammonia/air mixture into the gas side of each train of the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) within the superheater module.\n\n1.4  RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n1.4.1 Worst-case release scenario\n\nAs per regulations, the worst-case release scenario is the capacity of the ammonia storage t"

It is presumed that the release rate is less than the flow that would actuate the truck's automatic shut-off valve, and would continue for up to ten (10) minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles in a rural setting and 0.2 miles in an urban setting (if the wind is blowing toward King City). The affected population is less than 100.
