This is the only product at this location which fall under risk management plan requirements. The toxic and corrosive characteristics of anhydrous hydrogen chloride make it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling. Overall, the prevention of exposures and reducing the threat to associates personal health as well as reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations. It is Airgas Specialty Gases policy to adhere to all applicable local, state and federal rules and regulations. Overall safety of the facility depends upon the manner in which products are stored and handled, combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of the systems. \n\n\n\nWritten policies and procedures for handling hydrogen chloride are followed each day. Maintenance when necessary is contracted out to pre-qualified companies who have trained personnel in the proper maintenance of the systems. The mechanical integrity of the systems is maintained in accordance with all good engineering practices. Contractors have access to the Operations & Maintenance manuals for all systems.\n\n\n\nThis facility has a Process Safety Management plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements. The facility follows the Airgas Safety Management System that includes items such as Lock-out/Tag-out, Hazard Communication, Contractor Safety, etc. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place to aid in the prevention of accidental releases and natural disasters that may affect the facility. \n\nThe Greater Baytown LEPC and the Baytown Fire Department have been provided copies of this plan.

The Baytown Fire Department is the primary response agency to a release at this location and is trained in Hazardous Materials operations. \n\n\n\nThis facility has a toxic worst case scenario. The toxic worst case scenario for a toxic release would be the failure of a single tube on a tube trailer storing hydrogen chloride. This release if the vessel were full would have a release of 3,500 pounds of hydrogen chloride. \n\n\n\nActive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. \n\n\n\nThe distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 2.4 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered urban (Industrial). This release scenario could impact approximately 22,758 persons in a 2.4 mile radius. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software. \n\n\n\nAn alternate toxic release of hydrogen chloride from a Y-Container pressure relief device (PRD) would be the most probable release for this location. If this were to happen with the hydrogen chloride, an estimated release rate would be approximately 60 pounds per minute for 10 minutes. This 600 pound release would have a toxic distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered to be urban (industrial). This release scenario could impact approximately zero persons in a 0.3 mile radius. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT software. Y-Container PRD's generally are the weakest point of the package and if there was a release it most likely would occur at the PRD. \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from this facility in the past five year.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
