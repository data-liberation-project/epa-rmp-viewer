The program is described in detail in the Keegan Bayou WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety isssues are held regularly at the Keegan Bayou WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recongnize hazard and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Keegan Bayou WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."

      "SummaryText": "Keegan Bayou Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nRMP Plan Executive Summary\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Keegan Bayou Wastewater Treatment Plant (Keegan Bayou WWTP), one of several facilities owned by the Harrison County Wastewater and Solid Waste Management District and operated by Optech.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\nOptech believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Optech has developed proactive safety and environment programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Keegan Bayou WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Optech has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Keegan Bayou WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, Optech affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of requlated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no release would occur.  Accoordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequence of a release should on occur.\n\nOptech takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that it sempl"

The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nOptech management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and reference in the Keegan Bayou WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Keegan Bayou WWTP is located at 336 Iriquois Street, in Biloxi, Harrison County, Mississippi.  The Keegan Bayou WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  This wastewater treatment plant is sequence batch reactor facility with anaerobic digester.  The process equipment also includes a belt filter press.  The plant has an average  design flow is 4.5 MGD, with a peak capacity of 14.4 MGD.  In 1994, the Keegan Bayou WWTP won a second place O & M Excellence Award from the U.S. EPA Region IV.\n\nThe Keegan Bayou WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of eight containers (16,000 pounds) on site.  In addition, the Keegan Bayou WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of five containers (10,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Keegan Bayou WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nThe p"
