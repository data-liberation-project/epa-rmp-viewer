The Pulp Mill and Utility Department operates four process units, which contain EPA listed highly hazardous chemicals over the regulated threshold.  Chlorine is used in both the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant and the Utility Water Treatment Plant.  Chlorine dioxide is generated in two separate production units that supply the Bleach Plant.  \n\nS.D. Warren continuously strives to improve it's accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  Since 1980 we have developed many programs that eliminate or minimize the effects of an accidental release.  In 1992 the mill adopted the OSHA Process Management Program and in 1999 the mill implemented the EPA's risk management program (RMP program).  S. D. Warren 's risk management program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA's\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found in 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One requirement of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) to the EPA.  This RMP Plan submission satisfies the requirement.  The Plan provides the public with information about processes, accident prevention programs, and emergency response planning efforts at the Muskegon mill.  S. D. Warren 's complies with EPA's RMP Program.\n\n1.1.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\n\nS. D. Warren accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n\n1.1.1.MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  (A)(1)\n\nS. D. Warren has a management system in place, which oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  The Vice President / Mill Manager is responsible for RMP im"

This program, along with other mill policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.1.2.PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (A)(2)\n\nS. D. Warren maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program is based on the EPA Program Level   3- elements.  The RMP elements have been combined with the like elements of the mill's OSHA PSM program.\n \n1.2. S. D. WARREN STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING AT THE MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN SITE  (b)\n\nThe mill employs 684 full-time employees including all medical or other laid off employees some of whom operate the covered processes.  Chlorine is used in both the bleach plant and as part of the water production operations.  Chlorine dioxide is generated in two units that feed this 1% solution to the bleach plant.\n\n1.2.1.SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\n\nThe facility has covered chlorine storage at two locations.  First chlorine is received and stored in rail cars which can be unloaded, two at a time, to the evaporation and distribution system, The evaporation unit is contained in a process building.  The single rail car contains 180,000 lbs. The maximum inventory is 360,000 lbs.  Chlorine from this system is used in both the bleach plant and in the water treatment plant. \nThe water treatment plant has an alternate source of chlorine from one-ton containers.  Two containers are connected to the water treatment evaporation system located in a process building.  Up to eight full containers are stored in a sheltered process area adjacent to the process building.  The maximum inventory is 20,000 lbs.  \n\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the bulk chlorine storage in rail cars, in one-ton containers, the bleach process evaporation building, and the associated vent and exhaust systems.

First is the original unit.  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1% of a liquid mixture that is stored in two 15,000-gallon tanks that are surrounded by dikes.  The maximum inventory is 2,500 lbs. While a single vessel contains 1,250 lbs of chlorine dioxide.  The second process is a new larger unit.  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1.2 % of a liquid mixture that is stored in two 60,194 gallon tanks that are surrounded by a dike system.  The maximum intended inventory of these storage tanks and associated piping, reaction vessels etc is equal o 10,850 lbs of chlorine dioxide.  A single vessel contains 4,700 lbs of chlorine dioxide.  \n\n1.2.2.REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n\nChlorine and chlorine dioxide are the only regulated substance on site, which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity. \n\n1.3.WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  (c)\n\nThe worse case and alternate scenarios were evaluated using both EPA guidance and air dispersion modeling.  \nAn off-site consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule to estimate potential impacts to the community.  As required by RMP, S. D. Warren 's off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\n1.3.1.WORST CASE   (c)(1)\n\nThe worse case scenario involves the total release of an 180,000-pound rail car tank container to the atmosphere.  EPA guidance/RMP Comp was used to determine the release end point.\nThe worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ? 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ? 68.3.

      "SummaryText": "l data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind, which would not disperse a release effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released instantaneously.  According to the chlorine institute, no 90-ton rail car has ever instantaneously released its contents. The chances of such an event occurring on a 98?F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely remote.  \nWorst-case releases for the other three processes were evaluated.  Each case had a significantly smaller distance to the endpoint than the release of 180,000 lbs pf chlorine.  Under the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill (for purposes of RMP) would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mill's property line.\n\n1.3.2.ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\n\nS. D. Warren developed alternative scenarios for chlorine and chlorine dioxide, which focus on more realistic releases occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modeling a release, which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the process hazard analyses (\"PHAs\") performed on covered processes, and all past releases from covered processes, S. D. Warren chose the following alternative release scenarios:  \n\n1.3.2.1.A gasket failure in the chlorine liquid line from the 90-ton rail car to the vaporizer building;\n\n1.3.2.2.The failure of a chlorine valve whip; and \n\n1.3.2.3.The insufficient supply of water to the bleach plant original chlorine dioxide absorption tower.\n\n1.3.2.4.The leak of a chlorine dioxide transfer pipe from the R-8 unit storage tank that feeds the bleach plant.  The leak was estimated at 10% of the total liquid solution flow or 12,500 gallons of liquid per hour.\nEach of these release scenarios could result in a"

Warren accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the standard operating procedure for the facility.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chlorine-and chlorine dioxide specific actions within the site program.  These programs are coordinated with Muskegon fire department.\n\n1.4.1.GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\n\nFacility-wide, elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  The basic elements are described below: \n\n1.4.1.1.Employee Participation.  S. D. Warren has developed and implemented a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A) consulted with and what input they would have in the development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements.   (B) Given employees and their representative's access to PSM and RMP information.   \n\n1.4.1.2.Process Safety Information:  In accordance with applicable requirements, S. D.

Plus mill employees make up the operator, maintenance and emergency response teams. \n\n1.7.CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY  (g)\n\nS. D. Warren plans to discontinue use of two processes that contain regulated substances.   The first process to be shut down, isolated and decontaminated is the chlorine rail car and evaporation system.   This will reduce the maximum quantity in a single vessel from 180,000 pounds to 2,000 pounds.   Based on preliminary off site impact studies, the area and number of home and facilities impacted will be drastically reduced.  The second process to be shut down is the original chlorine dioxide generation facility.  This will reduce that chemical's inventory by 2,500 pounds.  \nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were also identified during the recent safety tour audit and hazards analysis.  The recommended actions have now been evaluated and are being implemented as required \n\nS. D. Warren continually reviews implemented and potential safety improvements for all of its operations.
