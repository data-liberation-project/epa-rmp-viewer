If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with local fire departments, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on the public and the environment.\n\n2.  The Milford Center facility is located on the south end of town along the abandoned railroad.  Milford is a fertilizer only facility that has anhydrous ammonia only for the direct application as a crop nutrient.  The anhydrous at Milford Center is received by semi truck only.  Milford has a 90,000 gal storage tank that would have a maximum storage of 397,800 lbs of ammonia.  The maximum amount handled outside the tank would be 42,000 lbs while off-loading a semi truck.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total amount in the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 397,800 lbs, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of disperson to 200ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario based on our five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .59 miles.\n\n5.  The Milford Center facility has implemented the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111 for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  ODA and other regulations are followed.\n\n6.  There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\n7.  Milford Center has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.  They have also provided local fire and LEPC with right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n8.  Our"
