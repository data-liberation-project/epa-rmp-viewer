This facility utilizes electrolysis-based hydrogen production and nitrogen separation to synthesize anhydrous ammonia, a critical component for agricultural and industrial applications. Given the presence of anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen above regulatory thresholds, the facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 \u0096 Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act.\n\nRegulated Substances and Processes\n\nThe Boone, IA facility operates an ammonia synthesis system that utilizes the following regulated substances:\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) \u0096 Used as the final product, stored in pressurized vessels.\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nAs required under Program Level 3 of the RMP regulations, Talus Renewables has implemented a comprehensive accident prevention program, including:\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) to systematically identify and mitigate potential hazards.\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure safe handling, storage, and transfer of hazardous materials.\nMechanical Integrity Program for proactive inspection, testing, and maintenance of critical equipment.\nTraining and Qualification for operations and maintenance personnel and third-party maintenance contractors.\nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures to evaluate the safety impact of process modifications.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Boone, IA facility is classified as a non-responding stationary source under 40 CFR 68.90(b), meaning it does not maintain an in-house emergency response team. Instead, Talus Renewables has established coordination with the Boone Fire Department and Boone County Emergency Management to respond to any accidental releases. The facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) includes:\n\nNotification procedures for local first responders and regulatory agencies.\nEmergency shutdown procedures for operators.\nCom"
