In addition to scheduled presentations by plant representatives, LEPC members and technical experts (environmental, medical, etc.), the CCAP meetings provide an open forum for community members to question plant management about their concerns relative to plant operations and to provide feedback from the community at large.  The plant participates in sponsoring attendance of CCAP members to the ACC's Building Communities Together workshop.  The workshop, which was attended by CCAP members and industry representatives from around the country as well as ACC leadership and regulatory officials, was reported to be very informative by CCAP attendees.\n\nPlant History:\n\nThe Lake Charles facility started operation in 1959 under the ownership of Hercules Incorporated.  In 1983, Hercules merged their polypropylene businesses with the polypropylene businesses of Montedison S.p.A of Milan, Italy to form Himont.  In 1995, Montell was formed through a merger of the majority of the polyolefins interest of Royal Dutch Shell Group of Companies with those of Montedison S.p.A, including Himont Incorporated.  In 1997, Shell acquired Montedison's 50% interest in Montell Polyolefins and in October of 2000, Shell merged with BASF to form Basell Polyolefins, a 50 /50 joint venture company.  In August 2005, BASF and Shell sold their interests in Basell Polyolefins to Access Industries Inc. based in New York City.  Access Industries Inc acquired and merged the Lyondell Chemical Company with Basell to form LyondellBasell Industries (LBI).  Upon emergence from chapter 11 protection in early 2010, LBI reorganized its operating entities and the plant became part of the Equistar Chemicals LP group.  The plant now occupies 285 acres of land on the corner of Highway 108 and Bayou d'Inde Road with an annual production of 1.5 billion pounds.\n\nProduct Information:\n\nLBI is a worldwide organization dedicated to the development,"

These processes include storage vessels and pipelines containing the following maximum intended inventories: Propylene Storage - 1,040,746 lbs.  ; Ethylene Pipeline - 4462 lbs.; Propane storage -333,081 lbs.  ; 1-Butene storage - 508,147 lbs.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards:\n\nThe worst case flammable scenario has been selected due to the potential impact on different public receptors.  This worst case scenario includes the release of the entire contents of the butene storage vessel and subsequent vapor cloud explosion with a 1psi endpoint that would reach a residential population.  The alternate case flammable scenario is the release of the entire content of a butene railcar through the pump unloading system and has a 1psi endpoint that would reach a smaller residential population segment and an adjacent industrial complex.  There were no worst case toxic release or toxic alternate case scenarios reported since there are no listed toxic chemicals above threshold quantities within the facility.\n\nAccident Prevention:\n\nMost processes at the plant are covered by 29 CFR 1910.119, the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard that requires each operation be subjected to a detailed Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  As a member of the American Chemistry Council, The plant is also committed to the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practices.  The hazards analyses for all Lake Charles Plant Processes have been completed, and action plans for the closure of findings have been developed.  Any changes to the processes (procedures, raw materials, process conditions, etc.) or plant equipment following the PHA must follow th"

The MOC team will track and document completion requirements, such as procedure revision and operator training, before approving the implementation of the change.  All PHA-s are revalidated at least every five years, and the PHA and revalidation documentation is retained for the life of the process. \n\nThe PSM Standard requires that each employee presently involved in operating a process, and each employee before being involved in operating a newly assigned process, be trained in an overview of the process and the operating procedures, including safety, health, emergency operations, shutdown, and safe work practices.  At the Lake Charles Plant both classroom and field training accomplish this, and written tests and field observation verify understanding of the training.  Maintenance and contract maintenance employees are trained, not only in the craft skills and repair procedures, but also, in the safety and environmental aspects of their job.  Refresher training for operators and maintenance personnel is conducted at least every three years and more often if necessary.  Training on certain safe work practices (e.g. hot work, confined space entry) is conducted annually.\n\nSafety Design Criteria (SDC), based on Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices and the company's long history of safe operation of our unique technologies world wide, are developed and documented for each process type (e.g.  Spheripol Polypropylene, Catalloy Polypropylene).  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted to verify compliance prior to startup.

The Lake Charles Plant has over 300 atmospheric detectors that alarm if a very low level of chemical release is detected.  This gives operating and maintenance personnel early warning of a problem which can be corrected before it presents a hazard to employees or the community.\n\nEmergency Preparedness:\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant has a written Emergency Response Plan which details the responsibilities of employees during emergency situations including fire, explosion, chemical release, and process deviations.  Each shift has a well-trained Emergency Response Team led by Incident Commanders who are normally the operations Shift Team Leaders.  The Emergency Response team members receive annual training at the Calcasieu Ward 6 Fire Training Center, and the Incident Commanders receive additional leadership training.  The plant has a dedicated emergency phone extension that is used to alert the plant Security Officers that an emergency situation exists.  The Security officer then activates the plant alarm system that is coded to identify the location and nature of the emergency.  The Emergency Response Team then switches to a dedicated emergency radio channel and responds according to the instructions from the Incident Commander.  The Emergency Response Team on each shift participates in a drill, once per year.  Although the drills are scripted in advance, the response Team members are not informed of the location or nature of the drill.  Observers time each step of the response and record the quality of the response.

All Lake Charles Plant employees receive regular fire extinguisher and fire hose handling training.  \n\nThe Lake Charles Plant has written procedures on emergency preparedness for unusual situations such as hurricanes and bomb threats.  Each of the process areas has backup emergency electrical power and instrument air to allow a safe shutdown in the event of an electrical power failure.  \n\nThe plant is an active participant in the Southwest Louisiana Mutual Aid organization whose mission is the coordination of fire fighting, rescue, first aid and law enforcement personnel, and facilities among LA industries and municipalities for mutual assistance in case of emergency situations.  Should the need for additional equipment or resources arise during an emergency, the incident commander can call upon Mutual Aid for assistance.\n\nCommunity Safety:\n\nThrough active participation in the Calcasieu CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) Group and the Calcasieu Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the plant is involved in developing and maintaining a system designed to protect the community in the event of a chemical emergency.  A network of sirens is in place to immediately alert the community of a chemical emergency and the need to monitor radio and TV for instructions from the LEPC.

      "SummaryText": "manufacturing, and marketing of a diverse range of polyolefins.  Olefins are hydrocarbon byproducts of oil refining such as propylene and ethylene.  When propylene or ethylene undergoes a process called catalytic polymerization, polypropylene or polyethylene, commonly called plastic, are formed.  At the Lake Charles Plant, we manufacture polypropylene resins using patented technology called Spheripol.  Where do you find our polyolefin resins?  In energy-absorbing bumpers on your car; in the siding that protects your home from the elements; in medical gowns; syringes that administer life saving medication; in shatter-proof packaging that is safer for children; in bicycle helmets that protect us from injury; and in the plastic wrap that keeps our food fresh."

Where the risk assessments have indicated a reasonable potential for off-site impact, equipment and procedures have been put in place to mitigate that off-site impact.  \n\nIncident History:\n\nIn 40 CFR 68.42, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires covered industries to report a five-year accident history in their Risk Management Plan based on the following guidelines: - all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  The Lake Charles Plant has had no incidents in the past 5 years, which meet these criteria.\n\nCommunity Outreach:\n\nThe ACC requirements for achieving Practice in Place for the Responsible Care codes of management practice (which the plant achieved in 1997) involve considerable interaction with the community.  Although Responsible Care has certainly increased these activities, The Lake Charles plant has always sought to be a good corporate neighbor.  Examples of this are participation in the Adopt-A-Road program since 1992 and the adoption of T.S. Cooley Elementary Magnet School as our Partner in Education in 1988.  Working with T.S. Cooley, the plant has provided tutors, judges for science and math fairs, chemistry experiments, financial assistance for field trips and competitions and U.S. Saving Bonds for graduates.  \n\nPlant management is an active participant on the Calcasieu Community Advisory Panel (CCAP).  Typical topics of discussion at CCAP meetings are individual plant's safety and environmental objectives and performance, incident investigations, products and processes, financial performance and outlook, exp"
