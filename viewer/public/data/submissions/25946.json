This commitment is a critical element of the facility's RMP/PSM Plan. It will extend not only through the initial development of the plan, but will endeavor to incorporate the practices and procedures established by this plan into the facility's normal way of conducting day-to-day business. RMax has established a management system to oversee the development, implementation, and successful continuing implementation of its RMP/PSM Plan. The goals of this system are:\n\n* Clarify the roles/responsibilities related to process safety issues at the facility;\n* Avoid problems or conflicts among the various people responsible for implementing elements of the risk management plan;\n* Avoid confusion and allow those responsible for implementation to work together as a team;\n* Ensure that the program elements are integrated into an ongoing approach to identifying hazards and managing risks;\n* Ensure effective communication about process changes;\n* Provide full compliance to all regulatory requirements.\n\nThe overall implementation of the RMP/PSM Plan is the responsibility of the Plant Manager. Under this plan, it is his duty to ensure all elements are ultimately implemented as described. Although other employees will have key roles in the RMP/PSM Plan, the Plant Manager assumes this overall primary responsibility.\n\nIt is in the best interest of Rmax and it's employees to continually evaluate potential safety issues. Should any employee find any area or practice to be a potential safety hazard, a supervisor is informed. RMAX's policy is not to wait for someone"

Entry to confined spaces will be permitted only after proper training has been conducted. RMAX employees are not permitted to enter a bulk chemical tank. \n\nIt is RMAX's policy to prevent chemical spills by maintaining chemical handling equipment, chemical storage tanks, chemical transfer lines, and containment walls, in excellent condition. In the case of a Major Chemical Spill, employees will immediately evacuate the facility. Employees will not attempt to assist in the clean up of a major chemical spill. In the unlikely event a containment wall fails to restrict a chemical spill, RMAX-certified HAZMAT technicians may be asked to place absorbent barriers in the flow path of the spilled chemical. However, RMAX employees will not be asked to make contact with hazardous spilled chemicals.\n\nFacility & Regulated Substances handled\n\nRMAX manufactures polyisocyanurate foam insulating board. The facility operates under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 32615 (urethane and other foam, except polystyrene, manufacturing). The foam board produced at the facility is used in both residential and commercial construction applications. RMAX produces foam board in thickness ranging from 1/2 inch to 4.5 inches.\n\nRMAX uses three main raw materials in the production of foam board: Methylenebis Di-Phenylisocyanate (MDI), Polyol, and Blowing Agents. The Blowing Agent can be either a hydrochlorofluorocarbon or a Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent, typically a blend of Cyclopentane and Isopentane. Several catalysts and fire retardants may also be used depending upon the type of foam board being produced. MDI is considered as part \"A\" and Polyol combined with blowing agent, catalyst and surfactants are considered as a part \"B\". Raw materials are all liquids and are stored on-site in bulk tanks.

RMAX uses several different types of facers, depending upon the type of foam board being produced. Once parts \"A\" and \"B\" are combined the liquids exothermically react to form solid foam. \n\nIsopentane, an integral component of the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent used by RMAX, is a substance regulated by 40 CFR Part 68. The maximum amount present in RMAX's foam board manufacturing process at any one time is approximately 66,470 pounds. This is above the threshold quantity for Isopentane of 10,000 pounds, as established at 40 CFR 68.130. Therefore, RMAX has determined that the Dallas facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68. RMAX has defined its covered process as that equipment which contains or contacts the Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent, starting at the bulk storage tank loading or fill connection, and extending up to and including, the mix heads located at the Pour Table. This determination was made based on the fact that, once the Blowing Agent is mixed with the other foam components, it is no longer a liquid and is part of a solid, non-flammable product. Thus, the blowing agent is flammable according to the definition 29 CFR 1910.1200(c). \n\nThrough preparation of this Risk Management Plan/Process Safety Management program (RMP/PSM), RMAX has determined that its Dallas Operation is a Program 3 process as defined by 40 CFR 68.10(d). This determination is based on the results of the worst-case release scenario for Isopentane, the location of public receptors being within the distance to the endpoint, and the applicability of 29 CFR 1910.119 to the facility. Thus, RMAX has complied with the requirements for preparation and submittal of a Program 3 RMP as contained in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nIn order to calculate the distance to the endpoint from a worst case release of Blow"

The program provided a conservative estimate for the distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure. The quantity of Isopentane used in the worst case release scenario analysis for RMax's Dallas, Texas facility has been determined to be the amount of Blowing Agent contained in the facility's on-site bulk storage tank. In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(e), and for purposes of calculating the distance to the worst case release endpoint, RMax has assumed that the entire contents of the single largest vessel containing Blowing Agent (66,470 pounds) is released as a vapor which finds an ignition source, and that 10% of the released quantity participates in a resulting explosion. RMax has determined that the distance to an endpoint of 1.0 psi overpressure is 0.3 miles. Using RMax's Latitude and Longitude as a center point, it is estimated that the residential population within 0.3 miles of RMax is 1209 persons. Based on visual reconnaissance, the population density within the affected area will be toward the northeast edge. The remainder of the affected area is occupied by industrial and commercial properties with no residences. Through a review of local street maps and by visual observations of the area surrounding its facility, RMax has identified several types of public receptors within the distance to the endpoint from a worst case release. These types of receptors include: commercial, industrial, and retail facilities. RMax has determined, through examination of the Addison, Texas USGS 1959 (photorevised 1989) 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle Map, that there are no environmental receptors located within the 0.3 mile distance to the endpoint from a worst case release from its facility. Modeling of the worst case release scenario was conducted using the EPA Program ALOHA v. 5.2.3. Meteorological data used for the modeling was taken from availa"

A detailed release footprint overlay was created using the Addison USGS Topographic Quadrangle Map.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nRMax has identified two possibilities for the alternative release of Blowing Agent that are more likely to occur than the release described as the worst case release scenario. These possibilities are:\n\n1. Transfer Hose Release of Blowing Agent (During tanker truck unloading); and\n2. Process Piping Release of Blowing Agent (Shear of piping within the building by forklift).\n\nA Transfer Hose Release of Blowing Agent occurring during truck unloading is referred to as Alternative Release Scenario #1, while a Process Piping Release of Blowing Agent occurring inside of the manufacturing building is referred to as Alternative Release Scenario #2. RMax has determined, based on the physical properties of the Blowing Agent, that a release from either a transfer hose or from process piping would result in the release/spill of a flammable liquid. The evaporation rate and boiling point of the Blowing Agent are such that a spill would probably result in the formation of a pool of flammable liquid. Thus, in evaluating the consequences of a Transfer Hose Release and a Process Piping Release, RMax has chosen to evaluate the potential radiant heat effects of a pool fire for each type of release.\n\nIn order to determine the effects of each Alternative Release Scenario, the following methodology has been used:\n\n(1) Determination of a release quantity and duration of Blowing Agent for each Alternative Release Scenario \n(2) Calculation of the maximum area of the pool of spilled Blowing Agent at a depth of one centimeter for each Alternative Release Scenario.

Based on the tank volume and input parameters at prevailing weather conditions for the area, the ALOHA model predicted an estimated release duration of 58 minutes, and a total amount released of 17,725 lbs. RMPComp estimated a distance of 0.1 miles to the heat radiation endpoint at 5 kilowatts/sq meter. The plot map footprint was generated from ALOHA using MARPLOT v. 3.2.1. A detailed release footprint overlay was created using the Addison USGS Topographic Quadrangle Map. Using RMax's Latitude/Longitude as a center point, the estimated residential population within 0.1 miles of RMax is less than 2 persons. Through a review of local street maps and by visual observations of the area surrounding its facility, RMax has identified several types of public receptors within the 0.1 mile distance to the endpoint from a Transfer Hose Release. These types of receptors include commercial and industrial facilities. RMax has determined through examination of the Addison Topographic Quadrangle Map that there are no environmental receptors located within the 0.1 mile distance from the facility to the endpoint from Alternative Release Scenario #1.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario #2\n\nThe quantity of Blowin"

However, in order to provide a more conservative estimate of the distance to the specified endpoint of a pool fire, RMax has assumed its building would have no mitigating effects on the consequences of such a fire.\n\nThe release was modeled by the ALOHA program as escape of a liquid to form an evaporating puddle. Based on the input parameters and prevailing weather conditions for the area, the ALOHA model predicted an estimated release duration of 21 minutes, and a total amount released of 1,182 lbs. RMPComp estimated a distance of 0.03 miles to the heat radiation endpoint at 5 kilowatts/sq meter. Because of the effects of adjacent buildings and flat topography (so-called \"near-field patchiness\") using the ALOHA model's urban terrain mode, release dispersion predictions for short distances are considered highly variable. A maximum threat zone of 107 yards was predicted for this scenario. Although ALOHA and MARPLOT did not produce a drawn footprint for this release scenario, an estimated release footprint overlay was created using the Addison USGS Topographic Quadrangle Map. The estimated boundaries of the footprint were presumed to be approximately 50% smaller than the size and extent of the footprint for Alternate Release Scenario #1. \nUsing RMax's Latitude/Longitude as a center point, the estimated residential population within 0.03 miles of RMax is 0 persons.

Applicable requirements of the following codes and standards were used throughout the various design stages and were certified by consulting Professional Engineers where required: NFPA 30, NFPA 58, NFPA 70, NFPA 479, SMACNA Round Industrial Duct Construction Standards, ACI 318, AISC, MSS, ASME, AWS, ASTM. Secondary containment for storage areas is provided by virtue of the impervious nature of the buildings. The Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent bulk storage tank has a permanent concrete secondary containment structure. Material storage areas and large containers holding hazardous substances are identified using the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) diamond marking system. \n\nThe Rmax Facility is also protected by a wet pipe sprinkler system.  This system is maintained by the Plant Engineer and is tested on a yearly basis. The Plant Engineer is responsible for overseeing the maintenance of the fire protection system, including testing and inspection of fire extinguishers, testing of the sprinkler system, and testing of enunciators associated with the fire alarm system.\n\nTo prevent the potential for ignition sources from either subcontractors or RMax employees), RMax maintains a \"Hot Work Permit\" Program.

In addition, the \"Hot Work Permit\" must be located at the perimeter of the defined work area until work is completed. These requirements apply not only to subcontractors but also to RMax employees who will be performing any type of welding, cutting, brazing, etc. \n\nNumerous safety systems have been installed at RMax in order to reduce the potential for a release of, or an employee exposure to, Blowing Agent. These systems include: the hydrocarbon injection system relief/recirculation system; the interlocked controls of the process; the ventilation system; the hydrocarbon sensor system; the manual E-stops at various locations, and the facility's grounding protection system. In accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.73 and 29 CFR 1910.119(j), RMax has developed and implemented written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of its hydrocarbon injection system.

The primary responsibility for the normal operation of the hydrocarbon injection system will belong to the Chem Mix and Pour Table Operators. In instances other than normal operations, operation of the system will be performed by RMax management personnel or under their direct supervision. Initial startup will be accomplished under direct management supervision. The operating limits, as well as the consequences of deviations of these limits, are explained in the RMP/PSM Plan along with the properties of, and hazards presented by, the use of a Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent. As a part of process modifications to allow the use of a Hydrocarbon Blowing Agent, RMax has made several modifications that will help to prevent employee exposure to, or an accidental release of, the chemical. These include the installation of a hydrocarbon sensor monitoring system (Drager System), the upgrading of its plant ventilation system, and the installation of splash shields at the pour table. \n\nInventory control of the Blowing Agent will be administered by RMax's internal procedures for receipt of chemicals.

For this reason, RMax has chosen to implement an Emergency Action Plan to address its potential facility emergencies. Emergencies that could be expected include: 1) fire / explosion due to the nature of the chemicals / raw materials used / present on-site; and 2) spills or releases of chemicals / raw materials from semi-bulk and/or bulk storage containers. The management-designated RMax personnel who will serve as Emergency Coordinators for the Dallas facility, and who must be notified in case of an emergency, such as a non-sudden release of hazardous substance, fire, explosion, natural disaster, bomb threats or civil disturbances are: Farmers Branch Fire Dept.; Farmers Branch Police Dept.; Plant Manager; Materials Manager; Plant Engineer; Production Manager; Plant Administration; Plant Chemist. The Emergency Coordinator will use professional judgment and experience to determine the action that will be taken, in accordance with the Emergency Action Plan. Decision-making criteria are included that the Emergency Coordinator should use to define situations in which the Emergency Action and Contingency Plan will be implemented.
