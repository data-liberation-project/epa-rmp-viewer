Both compounds are amino acids used in pork and poultry animal feed and in pet foods to improve the nutritional content of the livestock feed or the pet food. The amino acids are manufactured using an industrial fermentation process. The primary raw material for the fermentation process is glucose, which is derived from corn. The amino acids are extracted, purified, and packaged for distribution throughout North America. Some product is exported to foreign countries. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is covered under the EPA Risk Management Plan, is used at the Ajinomoto Heartland facility. Ammonia is used for pH control in the fermentation process and in the extraction process. \r\n\r\n**The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility**\r\nAjinomoto Heartland, Inc. is committed protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the use of hazardous industrial chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nWe have taken steps to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility. Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safe and proper operations. Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia. Approximately 75% of our employees have been trained to the HazMat Technician level, which allows quick response to any chemical release situation that may develop. \r\n\r\n**The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps**\r\nRegarding anhydrous ammonia, Ajinomoto Heartland, Inc. is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP). Under these programs, we have developed and implemented procedures and we have installed equipment to help minimize the risk of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. These items include:\r\n1.

The local Fire Department is aware of the hazardous chemicals used at our facility and they have toured our facility. Local industries and local emergency responders, including the Eddyville Volunteer Fire Department, have participated in periodic drills with Ajinomoto Heartland, Inc. \r\n\r\nThe Ajinomoto Heartland, Inc. facility has coordinated with the Monroe County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and is included in the Monroe County Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). We have coordinated with the South East Iowa Response Group (Haz Mat Team) in Ottumwa, Iowa, located approximately 17 miles away. \r\n\r\nAjinomoto Heartland, Inc. employees have been trained on haz mat response, spill reporting, and notifying the necessary public safety authorities to alert the public. \r\n\r\nAjinomoto Heartland, Inc. has the necessary equipment on site to deal with anticipated emergencies. Employees have access to and are trained in the proper use of Class A fully contained encapsulated chemical suits with self contained breathing equipment. If a haz mat release escalates, our local volunteer fire department can contact the South East Iowa Response Group (Haz Mat Team) in Ottumwa, Iowa for assistance. \r\n\r\n**Planned Changes to Improve Safety**\r\nImproving industrial chemical safety is a never ending process. We are continuously striving to improve our safety practices at Ajinomoto Heartland, Inc. As changes in technology, techniques, or procedures present themselves, they will be examined and considered for implementation to improve the level of our safety as related to handling anhydrous ammonia."
