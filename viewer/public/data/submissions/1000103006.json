These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from re-occurring.  Investigation reports are maintained for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nx.\tEmployee Participation - Equistar believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  Equistar is a member of the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program.  As a VPP Star Work Site, this facility has gone above and beyond the normal safety requirements to provide employees with a safe working environment.\n\nxi.\tContractors - Equistar hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Equistar has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  At this point the operators undergo testing and are certified on the job.  Refresher training and re-certification is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nv.\tMechanical Integrity - Equistar carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance is carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nvi.\tManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place at Equistar to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.\n\nvii.\tPre-Startup Safety Reviews - Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modification s in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nviii.\tCompliance Audits - Equistar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the app"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Equistar is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are stationed at the plant at all times to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled: Equistar's primary activity at the Victoria site is the production of high density polyethylene.  High density polyethylene is utilized in making a variety of plastic products such as grocery bags, plastic cups and plastic containers.  We utilize four (4) regulated substances at Equistar:  ethylene, hydrogen, titanium tetrachloride, and ammonia.  Of these substances, only ethylene exceeds the threshold quantity. \n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario: EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) was used by Equistar to perform a worst case scenario.  Per 40 CFR 68.25(b)(2), the worst-case scenario is the greatest amount of flammable gas in the piping.   The worst case scenario for Equistar Victoria is a catastrophic failure of the pipeline supplying ethylene to the process unit.  This scenario involves the loss of containment downstream of the pipeline control valve up to the pressure let-down valve to the process unit.  A catastrophic failure of this piping would result in a release of 2,2164 lbs. of ethylene to the atmosphere.  Utilizing EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) previously discussed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to an EPA defined"
