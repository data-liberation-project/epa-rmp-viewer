Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  \n\nMany of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Perdue Premium Meat Company, Inc. to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates many safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by 29 CFR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120(q).  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\nFacility Description and Substances Handled\n\nThe Perdue Premium Meat Company, Inc. stores and distributes refrigerated and non-refrigerated foods and other items. Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the food items.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 34,"

Offsite receptors were defined using the EJScreen Report (Version 2019) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPerdue Premium Meat Company, Inc. complies with EPA\u0092s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The design and construction of this facility is in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.\n\nPerdue Premium Meat Company, Inc. written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations.

This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.

The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.
