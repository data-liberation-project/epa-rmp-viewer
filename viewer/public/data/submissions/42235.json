      "SummaryText": "Iochem produces iodine by extracting sodium iodide from brine production wells. Brine flows from the wells into a reactor where sodium iodide is oxidized with chlorine and converts the iodide to elemental iodine vapor.  Iodine vapor is stripped and reabsorbed into a more concentrated solution with the addition of sulfur dioxide.  This solution is again oxidized to solid elemental iodine that is melted, flaked, and packaged into fiber drums. Regulated chemicals are chlorine and sulfur dioxide and are stored underpressure in adjacent storage tanks.\n\nThe Iodine Extraction Facility is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Plant safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, operating procedures, and training of our personnel.  By emphasizing at Iochem well-maintained equipment, proper procedures, and well-trained staff, the likelihood of a release will be reduced.  Recommendations for addressing the process hazards that are generated in the PHA, compliance audits, incident investigations, and management of change are used to improve process safety. Prevention Program 3 is followed to accomplish these goals and will minimize the potential for an unplanned release of the chemical substances.\n\nIochem is a non-responding facility to an accidental release ot hazardous subtances.  Instead we will evacuate and coordinate with Vici Fire Department who is prepared to respond to the emergency.  The plant has prepared an emergency action plan that includes evacuation procedures and is subject to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38."
