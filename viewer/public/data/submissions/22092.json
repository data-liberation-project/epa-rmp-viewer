This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Blending, repackaging and distribution of chemicals..  We have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine], Formaldehyde (solution) and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid].  Ammonia (aqueous) is used for ____________________________.  Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine] is used for ____________________________.  Formaldehyde (solution) is used for ____________________________.  Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid] is used for ____________________________.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Warehousing Operations.  In this scenario 2100 lb. of Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is"
