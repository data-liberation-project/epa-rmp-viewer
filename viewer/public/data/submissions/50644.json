ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n    It is the written policy of Keystone Foods Corporation to maintain a comprehensive safety and health program in each plant.  This comprehensive safety program includes HAZCOM, physical hazards, powered vehicles, personal protective equipment, hearing protection, respiratory protection, emergency egress, confined space, and emergency response programs.  The program details procedures that are to be implemented and assignment of responsible parties should there be a release of a highly hazardous chemical.  All safety program information is reviewed annually and a copy of the emergency response program is sent to the local Fire Department/LEPC for review and comment.  Equity Group-NC Division maintains an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program with current maintenance and operating procedures for the single on-site ammonia refrigeration system.  Mechanical integrity of the ammonia system is assured with a computerized preventative maintenance/parts tracking program.\n\nII.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND HIGHLY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS HANDLED:\n     Equity Group - NC Division is a poultry further processing plant located on an approximately 10 acre site.  The processing plant is a two story building used to house mixing, conveying, coating, frying, freezing, packaging, and warehousing facilities.  The product (processed chicken meat) requires refrigeration for processing and storage.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant for the large automated refrigeration system used in the process.  Freon refrigerant is also used in other areas of the facility for refrigeration and cooling of raw material.  \n\nIII.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n      The accidental release program is dependent on the plant maintaining good mechanical integrity through application of its computerized preventative maintenance (PM) program.  Preventive maintenance schedules and"

      "SummaryText": " procedures were determined following equipment manufacturer's guidelines and industry (IIAR) trade association recommendations.  This information was incorporated into the plant PMS computer preventative maintenance program.  Operators receive progressive training to improve professional competency.  Outside contractors come in to check the system monthly and fix any problems that are found.  The plant has a controlled purge system in the event of a catastrophic fire to allow a controlled release of ammonia from the system and prevent a possible explosion in a sudden vessel failure due to a large scale fire exposure.  Ammonia detectors are installed in process areas and on remote safety vents to alert the security and maintenance personnel that a release is in progress and to allow timely restoration of containment.  \n\nIV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n      There have been no accidents or incidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system at the Keystone Reidsville facility in the last five years.\n\n \nV.  OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n       As stipulated in EPA guidelines, worst-case and alternate case release scenarios must be completed for the regulated process at the Keystone Reidsville facility.  These off-site analyses have been calculated, and the results are on file at the Reidsville facility. \n\n\nVI.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n     Equity Group - NC Division has a written safety program designed to identify, evaluate and control safety and health hazards and provide for emergency response in the event of a hazardous chemical spill.  The site specific safety and health program has an organizational structure headed by the Plant Manager, a comprehensive workplan, a training program to train employees in recognizing and abating safety and health hazards before they are required to begin a new job assignment, medical surveillance of employees, standard operating procedures for all equipment in emergency situations, and written communication of safety and pro"
