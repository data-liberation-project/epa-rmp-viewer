      "SummaryText": "CHIQUITA PROCESSED FOODS, LLC\nEUGENE PROCESSING\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIntroduction\nChiquita Processed Foods is a Wisconsin based vegetable processor with two vegetable canning/freezing plants located in Oregon.  Chiquita Processed Foods, Eugene Processing, located in Eugene, Oregon, processes fresh vegetables from growers into frozen and canned vegetables for human consumption. Chlorine gas, used for bacteriological control, is located at this facility and is an invaluable component in vegetable processing. Chiquita Processed Foods is aware that chlorine requires certain safe handling precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure reducing the threat to our employee's health as well as the health of our neighbors and the community. \nRegulatory Background\nOSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations are defined by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) is defined in Section 112R of the Clean Water Act (40 CFR 68). These regulations establish the requirements of both the PSM and RMP programs for facilities that are either specifically designated by the rules or for facilities that possess certain chemicals in excess of threshold quantities. The RMProgram further assigns various program levels to facilities with specific Standard Industry Codes (SIC's). Frozen vegetable processors are designated as Program level 3 facilities because they are identified as SIC 2037 industries. Chlorine is the chemical used at this facility in quantities that require implementation of the RMP tasks. \nUnder these regulations, facilities are required to develop a complex multi-element safety program for related systems and plant operations as well as, under the RMP rules, an analysis of the off-site consequences that could result from a catastrophic release.  \nMajor tasks defined in these regulations address the following areas:\n1. Employee Participation    9. Process Hazard Analysis\n2. Process Safety Information    10. Hot Work Perm"

Trade Secrets\n\nFacility Background\nAgripac Inc, a vegetable processing cooperative, started business in 1971 with the consolidation of two grower cooperatives known as Blue Lake Packers and the Eugene Fruit Growers Association. The Chiquita, Eugene Processing, facility began construction as a vegetable processing facility in the late 1800's, as the Eugene Canning and Pack Company facility and eventually one of the facilities that made up Agripac, Inc. The Agripac Cooperative was then sold and became Chiquita Processed Foods in February 1999. Over the life of this plant, it has been continually improved, expanded, and key systems have been replaced or rebuilt. \nFacility Siting and Human Factors\nChiquita, Eugene Processing, is in an industrial zone located near downtown Eugene, Oregon about 400 feet southwest of the Willamette River. The main plant building covers about 128,000 square feet on 9.3 acres of property. The plant buildings have been expanded, added and deleted through the years. Residential property is located off the southwest corner of the property and a main city thoroughfare borders the west side. Industrial and commercial properties are on the remaining sides. Several factors, including facility siting and human factors, were considered during the preparation of the facility's Process Hazard Analyses and the Offsite Consequence reviews.\nChemicals and Processes\nThe plant chlorine system is located in an enclosed area, in an employee parking area, under the plant's main processing building. Chlorine gas is injected into this plant's process water to augment the city supplied water and provide increased bacteriological control. The plant uses a standard, vacuum demand, w"

Chlorine is sourced from a single one ton DOT certified cylinder with a backup cylinder in close proximity. Although there are generally two chlorine cylinders on site, only the one cylinder is attached to the system at any given time. Actual in stock quantities of chlorine may vary with process usage and restocking schedules. \nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\nQualified facilities must conduct multiple offsite consequence analyses (OCA's) and report, to the government and to the public, the potential consequences of the accidental release scenarios studied. A typical OCA consists of two elements; a worst-case release scenario and an alternate release scenario. The EPA has defined a worst-case release as the rapid release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance, from a single point, that could result in the greatest distance to an endpoint during weather conditions most apt to augment the plume distance. An alternate scenario is defined as a release that also reaches an endpoint offsite but is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. A chemical's endpoint is defined as the distance a chemical cloud could travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures should no longer occur. The distances to the various endpoints may be determined using sophisticated computer models or from the more conservative lookup tables provided by the EPA. Scenarios for this facility were determined using the EPA's lookup tables and are likely to reach further than those provided by a computer simulation.\nWorst-Case Scenario: While it is not believed that a release of the magnitude required by the RMProgram criteria would likely occur, Chiquita Processed Foods, Eugene Processing, has chosen to assume their worst case chlorine release scenario would be a rapid release of the contents of "

      "SummaryText": "two cylinders. Although there could be up to 4,000 total pounds of chlorine in the two cylinders, they are not interconnected and it would take a major incident such as large fire at the facility or intentional sabotage to release both cylinders simultaneously. Because the cylinders are located inside a building, it has been shown that this would be a mitigating factor that would greatly reduce the distance an offsite plume of chlorine would travel. Factors limiting the potential for this magnitude of a release include the location of the receivers away from normal traffic areas, a secured storage area, and safeguards such as operating guidelines, maintenance, policies, and procedures. There is no history of any releases from the chlorine cylinders at this facility.\nAlternate Scenario: The release exercise for the alternate chlorine scenario was assumed to have originated from a release of a single cylinder's pressure relief valve. The release area, in this scenario, would be considerably smaller than that of a worst-case. Cylinders, when empty, are exchanged with the supplier. The supplier in turn maintains the cylinders and relief valves to assure their safe operation. The facility's emergency response teams are equipped and trained in the use of the special tools they possess to mitigate chlorine releases.\nAccident Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\nThe safety of our employees and our neighbors depends on the manner in which our employees handle our chemicals as well as our standard operating and maintenance guidelines and the safeguards we utilize at our facilities. Chiquita Processed Foods practices and adheres to state and federal safety regulations including, confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work permits, safe chemical handling, and emergency response programs. Contractors are also required to adhere to these rules and regulations.\nAll employees are informed of the chemicals used at the facilities and any risks that may be associated with those chemi"

Any Chiquita Processed Foods employee that handles chemicals as part of their job function is further trained in the proper handling of those chemicals. Accesses to chemical storage areas are restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors. \nEmergency Response Program\nEach Chiquita Processed Foods plant has written emergency response programs to provide guidelines for handling various types of emergencies including the release of a chemical such as chlorine. In addition, certain fulltime employees are trained and equipped to respond to and mitigate chemical emergencies and releases. Each plant's emergency response plan prescribes the procedures to be followed by our employees during an emergency including evacuations and notifications of management, on-site response teams, and governmental agencies. In the case of a release of a toxic chemical that could reach off the facility's property, local emergency response agencies would be immediately notified of the release. Communications between the plant's Emergency Response Coordinator and the local emergency responders regarding such factors as the chemical released, extent of the release, and wind direction will determine the need for evacuation or shelter-in-place of our neighbors. Notifications and evacuations of neighbors will be conducted by the local emergency responders.\n5-Year Accident History\nThe RMProgram requires that all releases of a criteria chemical which occurred within the previous five years and caused any damages, injuries, or evacuation off-site, be reviewed. There have been no chlorine releases from the system. Should a release occur, every incident, regardless of how small, is to be reviewed and steps taken to prevent the incident from reoccurring. \nSummary\nAt Chiqui"
